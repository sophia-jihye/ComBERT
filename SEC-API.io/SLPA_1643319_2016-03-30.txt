 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

SLEEPAID HOLDING CO., a Nevada corporation ("Sleepaid" or the "Company"), was incorporated on December 17, 2014. On April 15, 2015, we entered into an exchange agreement (the "Exchange") with the shareholders of Yugosu Investments Limited ("YIL"), a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong. As a result of that exchange, the Company issued shares of its common stock in exchange for all the issued and outstanding shares of YIL. YIL is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as a result of the Exchange. As part of the Exchange, the Company issued a total of 9,770,000 shares of its common stock, in restricted form, to YIL's sole shareholder, AMAX Deluxe Limited ("AMAX"), a British Virgin Islands company ("BVI"). 

&#160;

Current Business 

&#160;

The Company is principally engaged in, together with its subsidiaries, the design and distribution of soft bedding products in the People's Republic of China ("PRC"). The Company's business in China is conducted by Yuewin Trading Limited ("Yuewin"), its wholly owned subsidiary located in Guangzhou. 

&#160;

Currently, we are selling the Sleep Aid, BEMCO and Whinny products to end customers through our self-managed and franchised retail stores in Guangdong and Guangxi Province in the southern part of China. Currently, we have a total of 29 stores. We manage 18 of these stores directly. The remaining 11 stores are owned by franchisees. These stores, whether self-managed or franchised, are approximately 40 sq. m. to 100 sq. m. in size and have similar buildout and d&#233;cor. For self-managed stores, the Company prefers to cooperate with the large shopping malls that have strong management and proven customers flow. We are provided with counter space in the stores which we are responsible for decorating and staffing. When we sell our products, the customer pays the store. The store receives a commission for the sale and remits the balance to the Company, typically within 60 to 90 days after the sale. In the financial year 201 5 , we received approximately 30% of our gross sales from one store and approximately 10% from another store. 

&#160;

For franchised stores, the Company has a franchise agreement with the franchisee in which the franchisee agrees to sell only our products which they purchase directly from us and to follow the Company's instructions concerning the layout and d&#233;cor of the franchised location. We do not currently charge the franchisees a franchise fee but we do require the franchisees to provide proof of their financial credit worthiness and ability to adequately capitalize, open and operate a retail store. The Company relies on the revenue generated from the sales of our products to the franchisees at the wholesale level rather than charging a franchise fee. When evaluating the appropriateness of a candidate to be a franchisee, the Company considers the following factors: 

&#160;

1. The candidate needs to have sufficient funds and capital for opening a new store. According to our estimates, the cost for a new store is approximately $30,000 ( approximately RMB200,000). &#160;

&#160;

2. The candidate needs to have relevant experience in operating a business. Experience in the same industry of the Company is preferred. 

&#160;

3. The candidate has to understand, accept, and execute the Company's marketing strategic plan. &#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company, in conjunction with the franchisee, considers the targeted customer groups, customer flow, and appropriateness of the location before deciding where the franchised store may be opened. 

&#160;

Sleep Aid and BEMCO products include different lines of mattresses, soft mats, silk blankets and pillows; while those for Whinny include various home textile items like bed sheets, quilts, pillow cases, blanket covers and outer covers for mattresses. The Sleep Aid and BEMCO products are also sold to customers in the other provinces of China through an exclusive wholesale agent. We are responsible for the product development of Sleep Aid and BEMCO products, but production is outsourced to a few third party manufacturers. For Whinny, we purchase the products for Royalcover, which owns the Whinny brand. In 2014, we had one supplier who provides us with approximately one-quarter of our products while we have two other suppliers each providing us with approximately 15% of our products. Our suppliers agree to deliver the ordered products within 30 days of our placing the order and must deliver products conforming to industry standards. Typically, our suppliers allow us 60 to 90 days to pay for the products ordered. 

&#160;

Sleep Aid is the self-developed brand of YIL which possesses proprietary rights. The PRC National Industry and Commerce Bureau has granted Yuewin four patents numbered 7518777, 7518742, 7518835 and 8243171 covering various kinds of mattresses, pillows, blankets, quilts, hospital and massage beds under the Sleep Aid brand name. All these products are designed and developed by Yuewin's in-house product development team in collaboration with third-party manufacturers, who manufacture the actual products. 

&#160;

BEMCO is a brand name of US origin that is renowned for its mattresses and soft beds. BEMCO products are being distributed all over the world via distribution agents. The Taiwanese agents for BEMCO have licensed Yuewin to design and manufacture mattresses and pillows under the BEMCO brand name and market them in Guangdong, Guangxi and Changsha of Hunan Province in China. The Company pays the Taiwanese agent an annual fee of RMB100,000 (approximately USD $16,350) for the distribution rights until 2020. The Company is concentrating on designing and distribution of the BEMCO products, and production will be outsourced to a few reliable manufacturers. 

&#160;

Whinny is a brand name owned by Royalcover Hometex Co., Ltd. ("Royalcover"), which markets a series of high-end bedroom textile products like bed covers, bed sheets, pillow cases, blanket covers, quilts, etc. All design and production of the Whinny items are done by Royalcover, which granted the exclusive distribution right to the Company to market these products in Guangzhou and Shaoguan in Guangdong Province. The Company will purchase the Whinny products from Royalcover and resell them at a certain margin, with no license fees required. Royalcover has its own marketing strategies for all its products, including those under the Whinny brand name. It will also assist the Company in specifically promote the Whinny brand products within those areas where the Company has the exclusive distribution right so that there will be more customer awareness of the Whinny brand name. 

&#160;

Starting on February 1, 2016, the Company has terminated the exclusive distribution right of Whinny products from Royalcover in order to focus more on our self-developed brand SleepA id and put more effort on the marketing strategy. 

&#160;

At present, the Company as a whole employs 67 employees to manage the finance, sales and marketing, logistic, product development and administration functions. The majority of its manpower is deployed in sales and marketing, which employs fifty employees. The Company's retail shops have a standardized layout and decor to enhance customers' recognition in order to build up brand loyalty. Sales to customers are typically on cash basis. For those retail outlets that are located within department stores or shopping malls, sales proceeds are collected by the cashier systems of the respective department store and shopping mall, which then settles the amounts due the Company during the next calendar month after the sales transaction. &#160;

&#160;

To promote its products, especially for those of Sleep Aid and BEMCO, the Company has engaged outside consultants for advice on brand building, participated in large scale trade fairs and organized product launching events during the past years. During the relatively short time span in which the Company has been in the soft bedding products market, it has built a name for itself as a reliable provider of high-quality products in Southern China. &#160;

&#160; &#160;

The Market and Competitive Profile 

&#160;

The PRC soft bedding products market is enormous but fragmented. According to the PRC National Furniture Association, there are more than 1,000 manufacturers of mattresses now in existence. They produce a great variety of products of different price range and functions to cater for the diversified demands from different segments of the market. &#160;

&#160;

No particular player in the industry is able to command a leading position or enjoy a lion's share of the market. The Company's management believes that even the largest player would not be able to capture more than 5% market share. In terms of competition, the Company regards TEMPUR and Sinomax to be its closest rival since they have similar product lines that are selling at similar price range. 

&#160;

The total market size is expected to continue to increase because the demands for bedding products are a function of the general economic situation, the state of construction and the real estate market and population demographics. Although the PRC economy has recorded slower growth to 6.9% in 2015 , its GDP growth is still expected to be in the region of about 6.5 % - 7% in the coming year , indicating th ere will still be an enormous potential demand for soft bedding products when such properties are to be occupied for residency. With the continuing affluence of the people in general, and the increase in more matured population who could afford to pay for high-end mattresses and soft beds, the market is expected to grow continuous in the next five years. &#160;

&#160;

The Company has worked to establish the brand names for Sleep Aid and BEMCO in Guangdong and Guangxi Province in Southern China. The awards we received from the Guangdong Furniture Association have big impact in the industry in Guangdong. The Guangdong Furniture Association was established in 1990 and has over 1,000 members. The Company received a "Top Ten Best Product" Award from the Association in 2012 as recognition that its products are rated as being some of the best products in the industry in Guangdong Province. The Company was also recognized as one of the "Top 10 Best Mattress in 2014" from the China Furniture Industry. Winners of this award were voted by representatives from major Chinese media, led by Phoenix New Media Ltd. (NYSE:FENG). Phoenix New Media has very large influence in the industry and is regarded as one of product information guide. The awards presented to us are recognitions of the high quality of our products and our leading position in that particular year when compared to similar products from other domestic suppliers in the market. 

&#160;

To capture a larger share of the soft bedding products market, it has plans for expansion over the next five years. The emphasis in 2016 is to further consolidate its leading position by expanding the distribution network in the two provinces where it now operates. The plan is to open more self-managed stores and invite additional ten operators to open and run retail stores or outlets to market the Company's products under a franchise arrangement. The next step will be to penetrate the market in other regions of the country. The Company has identified Chengdu, Henan and Shanghai as three key areas where self-operated stores will be opened in the next phase and be the springboard for expansion into the Southwest, Central and Eastern China regions respectively. The Company's proposed plan of operations is to operate 60 self-operated stores and 160 franchise stores in three years' time and 150 self-operated stores and 250 franchise stores within five years. &#160;

&#160;

The costs to open a new self-managed store including inventory to be kept on hand when opening the store, store display equipment (storage racks, and computers), and store decorations varies with size but the Company estimates that each new store would cost approximately $30,000 to $35,000. Among these three cost categories, $10,000 is required for the design, furniture and fixtures and equipment with the balance going to inventory. 

&#160;

According to our original plan, the development of our e-commerce platform will be of the highest priority, second will be the additional retail stores, and the last would be making acquisitions. The total estimate costs to execute the three plans completely are $3,000,000 for e-commerce platform, $2,000,000 for additional retail stores, and $2,500,000 for acquiring other operators in the industry. The costs originally estimated to execute the three plans in next 12 months are $500,000 for e-commerce platform, $220,000 for increases in retail stores, and for acquisitions, we are looking for appropriate targets that would bring about synergy. Currently, there is no firm financing commitments in place. But in view of the current market situation and our financial condition, the development of the e-commerce platform has been put on hold and that only 10 additional self-managed stores will been opened during the year ended December 2016. We do not anticipate further opening of such stores in the near future. Our existing shareholders have indicated that they will continue to invest additional capital to finance the Company's growth and execution of the development plans. We may also broaden our shareholders' base and may engage in offerings of our stock in the future in an effort to raise additional capital. We shall also seek the additional financing from banks in the form of loans. In the event that we are not be able to raise the necessary financing to execute all our plans, we intend to concentrate our efforts and resources on developing the e-commerce platform first, lower the number of the stores that we plan to increase and put any acquisition plans on hold. &#160;

&#160; &#160;

The Company considers the development of an e-commerce platform an effective means to complement the operation of the physical retails stores. As online shopping is getting very popular, the Company intends to use online facilities including its own e-commerce website, other mobile apps like Wechat, Weibo, and so on, for the promotion, advertising and marketing of its product. Customers can then purchase and pay online via the Company's e-commerce website and other online trading platforms like Tianmao (www.tmall.com) and Jingdong Mall (www.jd.com). The retail shops, whether self-operated or franchised, will then provide the "last mile" connection including delivery, assembling and after sales services. The management believes this O2O business model will greatly enhance its business and at the same time enable it to retain the very important data bank of its customer profile. 

&#160;

Expansion of the Company will also take the route of acquisitions of other operators in the industry and product lines of other brand names. This will enable the Company to speed up the expansion process and achieve multifold increase in its operational results. 

&#160;

With the enlarged network, the Company is also seeking to distribute more bedding products of other brands and other sleep related products like scented candles and perfumed oil diffusers and other home luxury items for the bedrooms and sitting rooms. 

&#160;

Included in the expansion plan is the opening of more retail stores, gradually increasing from the present number of 32 to 400 in five years' time. It is anticipated that we will require approximately $US 2.0 million in order to open the next 60 self-managed stores. The development of the e-commerce platform is estimated to cost approximately $US 3.0 million, but this has been put on hold in view of the current market situation and the Company's financial resources. We shall also seek acquisition opportunities to acquire other operators in the industry that can bring about synergy. We expect to carry out such acquisitions in the second half of 2016 with an estimated budget of $US 2.5 million budget. To finance our expansion, we shall be relying on the profits generated from our business, the continued financing from related parties as well as borrowing from financial institutions and private sales of our securities to investors. We see the ability to secure additional financing to be the major obstacles for the successful implementation of our expansion plans. Should we be unable to obtain such financing, we may have to postpone the opening of some of the stores and the intended acquisitions. 

&#160;

Competitive Profile 

&#160;

The market for the bedding products in China is very fragmented, with more than 1,000 manufacturers producing mattresses all over the country. However, the demand for bedding products is enormous and has been increasing rapidly with the continuous growth in the Chinese economy and the affluence of the Chinese population. Because of the much diversified tastes and preferences of the consumers, competition in the bedding products market is really a matter of design and quality of the products. With more than 1,000 manufacturers, there are issues or problems concerning product quality from inefficient producers. As a result, there is no particular brand that is strong enough to dictate the trend or capture a lion's share of the market. The management believes even the largest player in the industry would only be able to capture less than 5% of the market. 

&#160;

In terms of mattresses, the high end market is dominated mostly by foreign brands and imported products, which include Simmons, Serta, King Roll, Sealy or Posturepedic. Each of these has their own philosophy on their positioning in this market, with emphasis on the deployment of advanced technology and materials to being luxurious. The one thing they have in common is their products are of superior quality and provide the users with the appropriate support of the body that helps to relieve stress and help them enjoy a good night sleep. For example, Simmons is emphasizing on its AirCool memory foam design and individually wrapped spring coil technology. Serta puts forward different series of mattresses having design with input from the US National Sleep Foundation to help address five common sleep problems. They have the Nickeledeon Series for children, the luxurious Vera Wang Serta and Trump Home Series, and the high-tech iComfort Series to cater to different customer groups. King Roll and Sealy are more on the health function of the products to provide the much needed support to the human backbone, thereby improving on the quality of sleep of the users. 

&#160;

A few local brands include Sinomax, DeRucci, Artland, Somnopro and De Zhi Ren (Great Nature). Sinomax is the flagship brand of the Sinomax Group, a manufacturer and distributor of visco-elastic health and wellness products targeting the middle to high end segment of the consumer spectrum. The other manufacturers listed emphasize function, comfort, reliability, durability and cost effectiveness and are mostly targeting the middle to lower end segment of the market. In addition, there are a number of other local brands having similar lines of products being offered at a wide range of prices. 

&#160;

SleepAid takes pride in having its own design, employing top quality raw materials and technology to come up with the appropriate products to provide users with comfort and health support that leads to peaceful sleep. The Company believes these factors give its products an edge over other locally made items. &#160;
