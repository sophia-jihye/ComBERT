 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a national leader in the development, production and dispensing of innovative proprietary compounded pharmaceuticals that we aim to make available to physicians and patients at affordable prices. Under our Imprimis Cares program, we own, market and dispense a portfolio of lower-cost compounded therapeutic alternatives to higher-priced FDA-approved drugs in several therapeutic areas, including ophthalmology, urology, otolaryngology and infectious diseases. We believe our proprietary formulations may offer competitive advantages and serve unmet needs in the marketplace. We plan to expand our Imprimis Cares program by introducing additional customizable compounded drug formulations for patient populations that may not have available alternatives to increasingly expensive FDA-approved medications. Our Imprimis Cares program aligns with our corporate mission, vision and values of providing physicians and their patients high-quality individualized compounded medications at accessible prices. 

&#160; 

We are also developing our Custom Compounding Choice&#8482; business, which is focused on developing and dispensing a portfolio of non-proprietary compounded drugs for humans and animals in therapeutic areas that may be overlooked by commercial pharmaceutical companies. We also offer customizable compounding products that consist of sterile injectable and non-sterile integrative medicine therapies that are used in various therapeutic areas, including oncology, autoimmunity, chronic infectious diseases and endocrine and metabolic diseases. 

&#160; 

We own four ImprimisRx compounding pharmacies, based in New Jersey, California, Texas and Pennsylvania, through which we make, dispense and sell our proprietary compounded formulations and other non-proprietary products. All of our customized formulations are made in the United States of America. 

&#160; 

All of our proprietary compounded formulations are born from the clinical experience of a network of inventors, including physician prescribers, clinical researchers and pharmacist formulators, who develop and prescribe customized medicines for individual patient needs. We pursue a development pathway for potential formulation candidates that involves working collaboratively with these inventors to identify and evaluate intellectual property related to the formulation, assess relevant markets for the formulation, and seek to validate the clinical experience relating to the formulation with the objective of investing in commercialization activities. Although our business is focused on a compounding commercialization strategy, we may also consider other commercialization pathways, including pursuing FDA approval to market and sell a drug formulation or technology. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We have incurred recurring operating losses and have had negative operating cash flows since July 24, 1998 (inception). In addition, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $58 million at December 31, 2015. Beginning on April 1, 2014, when we acquired our first ImprimisRx compounding pharmacy, we began generating revenue from sales of certain of our proprietary drug formulations and other non-proprietary formulations; however, we expect to incur further losses as we integrate and develop our pharmacy operations, evaluate other programs and continue the development of our formulations. 

&#160; 

Compounded Formulations 

&#160; 

We produce and sell a portfolio of proprietary compounded formulations in the ophthalmology, otolaryngology, urology and infectious diseases therapeutic areas under our Imprimis Cares business, as well as non-proprietary formulations under our Custom Compounding Choice program. Below are descriptions of our currently available formulations. We also continue to evaluate and assess intellectual property and other assets we have developed or acquired, including provisional patent applications, in order to support our development and potential commercialization of additional formulations in these and other therapeutic areas, including wound healing and dermatology. 

&#160; 

Ophthalmic Formulations 

&#160; 

In 2013, we acquired intellectual property trademarked as SSP Technology TM , which relates to compounded formulations for ocular injection of anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial agents during ocular surgery. SSP Technology allows for increased solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients and the creation of small, uniform particle sizes, which allows these compounded formulations to be used as an intraoperative injectable or as a topical eye drop. Since our acquisition of this technology, we have continued its development to include additional active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as NSAIDs. These compounded ophthalmic formulations have begun to impact the fast-growing cataract surgery eye drop market and the LASIK surgery eye drop market and may have potential in other ophthalmology markets for procedures where there is a risk of inflammation and infection. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary ophthalmic formulations provide physicians with the ability to address a primary ocular complication of ophthalmic surgery, infection risk and post-operative inflammation due to patient non-compliance with traditional multiple bottle eye drop regimens, by reducing the complexity of, or in many cases altogether avoiding the need for, post-operative eye drop regimens. We market these ophthalmic formulations as our Dropless Therapy&#174; and LessDrops&#174; formulations. We also package multiple ophthalmic compounded formulations, which may include our proprietary Dropless Therapy or LessDrops formulations and other non-proprietary formulations, as kits and dispense these kits to patients with needs for multiple ocular therapies. 

&#160; 

Dropless Therapy Formulations 

&#160; 

The cataract surgery market continues to experience significant growth. According to a 2013 Market Scope report, 3.6 million cataract surgeries were performed in the U.S. and nearly 22 million cataract surgeries were performed globally, with expected annual market growth of approximately 3%. The National Eye Institute estimated that over 24 million Americans currently have cataracts and that this number will grow to 38 million by 2030 and to more than 50 million by 2050. Transparency Market Research has estimated that the ophthalmology drug market is expected to reach an estimated $21.6 billion by 2018. 

&#160; 

Typically, the treatment regimen for the prevention of post-cataract and other intraocular surgery complications is a pre-operative and post-operative self-administered eye drop regimen, which requires strict patient compliance and careful adherence to a prescribed dosing schedule. Physicians have reported and studies have shown that eye drop regimens can be confusing to patients, which can cause non-compliance and incorrect dosing. Numerous published studies conducted in the U.S. and Europe have demonstrated that antibiotics administered into the eye at the time of cataract surgery significantly reduced the risk of developing inflammation and infection. 

&#160; 

Our Dropless Therapy formulations, which we developed based on our SSP Technology, are used as an injectable during ocular surgery. Ophthalmologists have reported that use of our Dropless Therapy formulations has substantially reduced or eliminated the need for patient-administered eye drops following ocular surgeries they have performed, thereby largely eliminating patient non-compliance and dosing errors with post-operative care regimens. Physicians have also reported spending less time on instructions and follow-up with post-operative patients and receiving fewer calls from pharmacists seeking to change the physicians&#8217; prescribed eye drop regimens, which collectively can reduce the physicians&#8217; costs of patient care. By reducing reliance on post-operative eye drops, we believe the use of our Dropless Therapy formulations can simplify the post-operative care process, provide safeguards against bacterial infection and inflammation and decrease overall costs. An economic study conducted in 2015 by researchers at Andrew Chang &#38; Co, LLC and co-sponsored by us demonstrated that, assuming the cost of Dropless Therapy is $100 per dose, our Dropless Therapy formulations could provide collective savings to Medicare, Medicaid and patients of up to $13 billion, with a most likely savings estimate of $8.7 billion, over a 10-year period. Since launching these formulations in April 2014, more than 450 ophthalmologists have adopted our Dropless Therapy formulations and a growing number of high-volume cataract surgery practices, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers throughout the U.S. have become Dropless Therapy customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

LessDrops Formulations 

&#160; 

According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), over one-half of Americans require some form of vision correction, 43 million of these individuals are candidates for refractive surgery, and nearly 96% of the refractive surgery procedures performed are LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) surgeries, an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. According to Statista, an estimated 693,000 LASIK procedures were performed in U.S in 2014. 

&#160; 

Our LessDrops topical compounded formulations, which we developed based on our SSP Technology, were initially formulated and dispensed during the first quarter of 2015 as combination eye drop formulations for patients following laser refractive surgery, including LASIK and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), cataract and other ocular surgeries. We estimate that our LessDrops combination eye drop formulations may require the administration of up to 50% fewer drops by patients post-surgery and may cost up to 75% less than other currently available post-surgery drops regimens. We plan to add to our portfolio of LessDrops combination eye drop formulations in order to deliver additional eye drop choices for our customers. 

&#160; 

Otolaryngology Formulations 

&#160; 

In October 2015, we acquired the assets of a leading U.S. provider of topical compounded sinus formulations, delivery systems and patented packaging. Topical administration of sinusitis medications such as antibiotics, antifungals and steroids have gained increasing popularity as an alternative to systemic oral therapies, as topical delivery may minimize the side effects seen with systemic oral agents that non-specifically deliver medicine to the entire body. Our topical delivery platform delivers sinusitis medications locally to the sinonasal mucosa, which is typically the direct site and probable source of the problem. The assets we acquired consisted of customer lists of more than 8,000 active prescribers, representing eight out of 10 ear, nose and throat physicians that serviced more than 38,000 patients annually. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology&#8217;s Head and Neck Surgery 2015 Guidelines, sinusitis affects about one in eight adults in the U.S resulting in over 30 million annual diagnoses, and more than 20% of antibiotics prescribed for adults in the U.S. are to treat sinus infections and the total direct cost of managing acute and chronic sinusitis exceeds $11 billion per year. 

&#160; 

Urology Formulations 

&#160; 

HLA Formulation 

&#160; 

In 2014, we entered into a license agreement to acquire commercialization and distribution rights in the U.S. to a patented urologic formulation of heparin and alkalinized lidocaine (HLA), which is delivered directly to the bladder for the treatment of interstitial cystitis (IC), also known as painful bladder syndrome. Our commercialization and distribution rights for HLA became exclusive in April 2015. Published studies have demonstrated that the use of HLA instillations in patients with IC alleviate IC symptoms, including pain and frequency and urgency of urination, with the use of this combination of ingredients. During the first quarter of 2015, we launched our Defeat IC&#8482; &#169; national education campaign, which is designed to help increase awareness among medical practitioners and patients about IC and our HLA treatment option. It is estimated that five to ten million women and men in the U.S. are affected by this chronic disease, and based on our self-directed survey of over 400 patients, we believe the total U.S. market opportunity for IC could exceed $4 billion a year. 

&#160; 

Other Available Urologic Formulations 

&#160; 

We also offer customizable compounded formulations of PPS-DR oral medication that may be prescribed by physicians as a lower-cost therapeutic alternative to an off-patent oral drug, Elmiron &#174; , for the treatment of symptoms associated with IC. Our PPS-DR compounded formulations are customized to an individual patient and feature time delayed release that may allow for reduced daily dosing requirements. 

&#160; 

Our other commercially available urologic compounded formulations consist of lyophilized (freeze-dried) formulations for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Our ED compounded formulations are provided in a sterile powder and dispensed in single-dose vials that can be conveniently transported and stored up to six months prior to reconstitution, and once reconstituted should be used within 30 days. We are also developing and validating a proprietary injectable formulation that may also be used to treat ED, as the American Urological Association has indicated that intracavernous vasoactive injections are considered the most effective non-surgical treatment for ED. 

&#160; 

Other Imprimis Cares Compounded Therapeutic Alternatives 

&#160; 

Our Imprimis Cares business aligns with our corporate mission and vision of providing physicians and their patients with affordable access to the medicines they need. As part of our Imprimis Cares initiative, we recently introduced customizable compounded formulations of pyrimethamine and leucovorin, which are available for physicians to consider prescribing for their patients as a lower-cost therapeutic alternative to Daraprim &#174; . The FDA-approved label for Daraprim indicates that it is prescribed for toxoplasmosis, which can be of major concern for patients with weakened immune systems such as patients with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women and children. Our formulations of pyrimethamine and leucovorin are now offered by Express Scripts, the largest pharmacy benefit manager in the U.S., and by many other hospitals and healthcare organizations. We also recently announced plans to introduce new patent-pending tiopronin and potassium citrate delayed release compounded formulations that may be prescribed by physicians as a lower-cost therapeutic alternative to FDA-approved Thiola &#174; for cystinuria patients. Cystinuria is an inherited disease that causes stones made of the amino acid cystine to form in the kidneys, bladder and/or urethra. It is estimated that the disorder occurs in one in 7,000 people worldwide. Our compounded alternative containing tiopronin, the active drug ingredient in Thiola, and potassium citrate, may reduce the cost of therapy for cystinuria patients by more than 70% and is expected to be available in April 2016. During 2016, we plan to introduce additional cost-effective compounded alternatives for other therapeutic areas and to continue to partner with payors to provide their beneficiaries access to these alternatives. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Custom Compounding Choice Formulations 

&#160; 

Our Custom Compounding Choice business is focused on marketing a portfolio of non-proprietary customizable compounded drugs for humans and animals, including sterile injectable and non-sterile integrative therapies, in therapeutic areas that may be overlooked by commercial pharmaceutical companies, such as oncology, autoimmunity, chronic infectious diseases, and endocrine and metabolic diseases. We also offer customizable hormone replacement therapies and a variety of weight loss and dermatology compounded formulations. Many of these formulations are offered in different formats than other available alternatives, such as in suspension or lyophilized, which we believe may provide differentiating and potentially beneficial factors as compared to competing therapies. As part of these efforts, we develop educational campaigns about our products and we sponsor regional conferences related to furthering education and awareness of our formulation options within the integrative medical community. 

&#160; 

Compounding Strategy 

&#160; 

We dispense and sell our proprietary compounded formulations and other non-proprietary products to physicians and patients through our four ImprimisRx compounding pharmacies. We have begun developing &#8220;ImprimisRx&#8221; as a uniform brand for our compounding facilities, with the intent of renaming all of our compounding facilities under this name. 

&#160; 

Compounding Pharmacies 

&#160; 

Compounding pharmacies combine different ingredients, some of which may be FDA-approved, to create specialized preparations prescribed by a physician to treat an individually identified patient. Often this is because a standard medication approved by the FDA is not appropriate for a particular patient&#8217;s needs. In some cases, compounded drugs for particular patients may have wide market utility and appeal for larger patient populations. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions, or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. A physician may also work together with a pharmacist to repurpose or reformulate FDA-approved drugs via the compounding process to meet a patient&#8217;s specific medical needs. Our ImprimisRx compounding pharmacies receive their active pharmaceutical ingredients from three main suppliers, which accounted for 43% of drug and chemical purchases in 2015. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information. 

&#160; 

We currently operate our pharmacy businesses under Section 503A of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Under the FDA&#8217;s current policy, a pharmacy operating under Section 503A of the FDCA is only permitted to compound a drug for an individually identified patient based on a prescription for that patient, and is only permitted to distribute the drug interstate as long as the pharmacy is licensed to do so in the states where it is compounded and where it is received. Our ImprimisRx compounding pharmacies are collectively licensed to distribute compounded formulations in 50 states. These policies limit compounding pharmacies from engaging in the practice of anticipatory compounding, which involves, preparing compounded medications before the actual receipt of a prescription or practitioner&#8217;s order, thus prohibiting compounding pharmacies from compounding in large quantities for distribution. Anticipatory compounding is an important component of pharmacy practice, particularly in sterile compounding. The law does allow compounding pharmacies with a history of filling certain prescriptions to prepare larger batches so that medications will be ready when they are needed. It also reduces the cost of compounded medications, as economies of scale can be realized by producing larger batches and less wasted chemicals, dilutions, fillers, and other associated products are produced, and leads to more accuracy and uniformity in finished medications, as larger batches decrease the variation caused by preparing multiple, smaller batches. In order to enable us to more easily engage in anticipatory compounding, we are working to develop and register two of our four pharmacy facilities as outsourcing facilities, as discussed below. 

&#160; 

Outsourcing Facility Strategy 

&#160; 

Section 503B of the FDCA provides that a pharmacy engaged in preparing sterile compounded drug formulations may voluntarily elect to register as an &#8220;outsourcing facility,&#8221; a new form of entity permitted to compound large quantities of drug formulations without a prescription and distribute them out of state without limitation, if the drug formulations appear on the FDA&#8217;s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appear on the FDA&#8217;s &#8220;clinical need&#8221; list. According to the University of Utah&#8217;s Drug Information Service, there were over 140 drugs on the FDA&#8217;s drug shortage list during 2015, while the &#8220;clinical need&#8221; list has not yet been established by FDA. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to additional requirements that do not apply to compounding pharmacies, including current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and regular FDA inspection. Due to the clinical need of the formulations we offer and the nature of the active pharmaceutical ingredient components, we believe they will be eligible for compounding by and distribution from Section 503B outsourcing facilities. 

&#160; 

In February 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for space in New Jersey and began construction efforts to build the majority of this space into an outsourcing facility. The remaining space in the facility will be completely separate and secured and will be constructed as a compounding pharmacy to replace our current New Jersey pharmacy location. From time to time during the construction process, we have experienced temporary and intermittent delays in developing and outfitting this facility. As a result, we have extended our estimated completion date and now expect the facility to be completed and registered as an outsourcing facility near the end of the second quarter of 2016. In addition, we are near completion of our construction efforts to our Texas compounding pharmacy and intend to register it with the FDA as a Section 503B outsourcing facility during the second quarter of 2016. We estimate that our capital expenditures to build and equip these new facilities will be approximately $4 million. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe that, with our current compounding pharmacy facilities and the successful completion and registration of our planned outsourcing facilities, we will have the infrastructure to scale our business appropriately under the current regulatory landscape and meet the growth in demand we are targeting in the ophthalmology, urology and other therapeutic areas. We plan to invest in one or more of our pharmacies to further their capacity and efficiencies. We may seek to access greater redundancy and markets through acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic transactions. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We have developed and plan to continue to build small internal sales and commercialization teams that are focused on growing sales of our available formulations. Our sales and marketing efforts are currently organized into two departments, one of which focuses on our ophthalmology formulations and the other of which focuses on our available formulations in other therapeutic areas. We have also begun to establish a sales and marketing team focused on the therapeutic areas served by our Custom Compounding Choice business. Our sales and marketing activities consist primarily of efforts to educate doctors, ambulatory surgery centers, healthcare systems, hospitals and other users throughout the U.S. about our products. Although we believe that our proprietary drug formulations could have commercial appeal in international markets and we have engaged distributors and entered into out-licensing arrangements for certain of our proprietary formulations in certain non-U.S. markets, we expect to continue to focus our efforts on our U.S. commercial opportunities during 2016. We also may choose to pursue commercialization of our proprietary formulations in other selected markets through licensing or collaborative arrangements with strategic partners in the future. 

&#160; 

Formulation Development and Commercialization Pathway 

&#160; 

Our model for the selection and development of proprietary formulations focuses on assessing new development opportunities using a four-step proprietary process, consisting of the identification, evaluation, validation, and ultimately commercialization of selected opportunities. Our relationships with inventive physicians and pharmacists provide us with access to numerous formulation candidates and technologies to evaluate and validate. These compounded drug formulations are initially made for individual patients and are developed based on the physician&#8217;s and pharmacist&#8217;s experience formulating a new therapy to address an unmet need. As a result of our review process, we focus our commercialization efforts on a select group of promising formulations that we believe may be patentable and that could have broad appeal to patients and physicians. Our product development strategy is to focus on a select few therapeutic areas in which we believe there is broad market potential, large unmet needs and/or unique value to physicians and patients and to develop and offer formulations within these therapeutic areas that could afford us with gross margins. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Identify 

&#160; 

Our innovation model, which serves as our research and development pipeline, relies on our relationships and partnerships with inventors to identify and secure new development assets. We are strategically attentive to the ideas generated by pharmacists, who work directly with doctors and their patients to address specific and often unmet patient needs, in our identification of formulations to develop and commercialize. We believe that our collaborative relationships with a growing group of physicians and pharmacists will bring additional clinically and commercially relevant formulation opportunities to us for potential development. 

&#160; 

Evaluate 

&#160; 

After we have identified potential formulations and technology for development, we subject them to our proprietary evaluation process. We invest heavily in intellectual property review and analysis at this stage, which includes analyzing the patentability of each formulation and, more generally, trying to understand the surrounding intellectual property landscape. We also evaluate any existing supportive clinical data, identify one or more appropriate commercialization pathways to potentially make the therapy available to patients and, for selected candidates, ultimately seek to acquire, through ownership or licensing of development rights, the formulations we believe are the most promising. 

&#160; 

Validate 

&#160; 

Following the identification and evaluation process and our acquisition of development rights, we seek to validate our assessment of potential drug formulations through our review of any existing clinical data and documented patient experience and through our sponsorship of investigator-initiated studies, which are typically funded or co-funded by us and conducted by physician groups. Any clinical data we obtain may be used to support physicians&#8217; clinical confidence in prescribing the formulation in compounded form or, if we decide to pursue FDA approval for a particular candidate, to support a development program in connection with the pursuit of such approval. The costs associated with our validation approach may be significantly lower than a traditional FDA approval process because, if we consider and select compounding as an appropriate commercialization pathway, we would not need to obtain FDA approval in order to market and sell the formulation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Commercialize 

&#160; 

Following successful results in the first three steps of our assessment, we focus on commercialization. As part of the development of potential formulations, we evaluate and select an appropriate commercialization pathway to make these therapies available to patients. We consider multiple commercialization pathways, including dispensing formulations through compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities and pursuing FDA approval to market and sell a drug formulation or technology. We are pursuing, and expect to continue to pursue, a compounding commercialization strategy for our currently available proprietary formulations and the other assets that we currently own or have rights to develop, and we do not presently expect to pursue FDA approval for any of these formulations or other assets. Depending on the selected commercialization pathway, we would build, or contract with a third party to build, appropriately targeted commercialization teams in order to market the therapies to physicians and patients, consistent with our sales and marketing structure discussed under the &#8220;Sales and Marketing&#8221; section above. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries are highly competitive. We compete against branded drug companies, generic drug companies, outsourcing facilities and other compounding pharmacies. We are significantly smaller than some of our competitors, and we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of our proprietary formulations or compete for market share in these sectors. The drug products available through branded and generic drug companies with which our formulations compete have been approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and are required to be manufactured in facilities compliant with cGMP standards. Although we prepare our compounded formulations in accordance with the standards provided by United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) &#60;795&#62; and USP &#60;797&#62; and applicable state and federal law, our proprietary compounded formulations are not required to be, and have not been, approved for marketing and sale by the FDA. As a result, some physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and some patients may be unwilling to use, our formulations. Additionally, under federal and state laws applicable to our current compounding pharmacy operations, we are not permitted to prepare significant amounts of a specific formulation in advance of a prescription, compound quantities for office use or utilize a wholesaler for distribution of our formulations; instead, our compounded formulations must be prepared and dispensed in connection with a physician prescription for an individually identified patient. Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, are able to sell their FDA-approved products to large pharmaceutical wholesalers, who can in turn sell to and supply hospitals and retail pharmacies. Even if we are successful in registering certain of our facilities as outsourcing facilities, our business may not be scalable on the scope available to our competitors that produce FDA-approved drugs, which may limit our potential for profitable operations. These facets of our operations may subject our business to limitations our competitors offering FDA-approved drugs may not face. 

&#160; 

Biotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Products developed by our competitors, including FDA-approved drugs and compounded formulations created by other pharmacies, could render our products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete. Any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing the products, which may require that we seek to raise additional funds that may or may not be available to continue our operations. The competitive environment requires an ongoing, extensive search for medical and technological innovations and the ability to develop and market these innovations effectively, and we may not be competitive with respect to these factors. Other competitive factors include the safety and efficacy of a product, the size of the market for a product, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or approved drugs, the price of a product relative to alternative products, the availability of third-party reimbursement, the success of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition and the availability of scientific and technical information about a product. Although we believe we are positioned to compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, if our proprietary formulations are unable to compete with the products of our competitors, we may never gain market share or achieve profitability. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We conduct a fulsome analysis of the intellectual property landscape prior to acquiring rights to formulations and filing patent applications. As of March 17, 2016, we owned two issued U.S. patent and one issued Canadian patent, which cover certain technology related to a former product candidate that we are no longer pursuing. Our existing patents expire in 2016 in the U.S. and 2018 in Canada, and we do not expect the life of these patents to be extended beyond these dates. In addition, as of March 17, 2016, we owned 25 U.S. patent applications, including 18 utility and seven provisional patent applications, and we owned three international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and 19 foreign patent applications. Although our ophthalmology-related patent applications include claims related to non-ophthalmology fields, we have primarily focused our intellectual property development efforts to date on the proprietary compounded formulations in the field of ophthalmology. We presently have 10 U.S. and nine foreign patent applications pending that relate to our SSP Technology. We expect to file additional patent applications in the U.S. and pursue patent protection for certain of our formulations in other important international jurisdictions in the future. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

As of March 17, 2016, we had 84 issued trademarks, pending trademark and copyright applications, or registered copyright and/or trademarks for Imprimis &#174; , ImprimisRx &#174; , Imprimis Pharmaceuticals&#8482;, Imprimis Cares!&#8482;, SSP Technology&#8482;, Go Dropless&#8482;, LessDrops &#174; , Dropless&#8482;, Dropless Cataract Surgery&#8482;, Dropless Cataract Therapy&#8482;, Dropless Therapy &#174; , Defeat IC&#8482; &#169; , HLA Therapy&#8482;, Triple Drop&#8482;, PPS-DR&#8482;, Trimix-LP&#8482;, Stericheck&#8482;, Trimoxi&#8482;, Pred-Moxi&#8482;, Pred-Moxi-Ketor&#8482;, Pred-Moxi-Brom&#8482;, Pred-Ketor&#8482;, Dex-Moxi&#8482;, Combination Drop Therapy&#8482;, Compounded Alternative&#8482;, Compounded Choice&#8482;, Custom Compounding&#8482;, Custom Compounding Choice&#8482;, and ED Free&#8482;. We may choose to pursue trademark protection in other jurisdictions for one or more of these or other marks in the future.

&#160; 

We also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation in order to develop our formulations, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others, including certain service providers. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our current employees and certain consultants. However, our employees and consultants may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. In addition, inventions relevant to us could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us, in which case we may have no rights to use the applicable invention. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2012 (collectively, the Health Reform Law); statutes and regulations of the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell. Below are descriptions of some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact our current and planned operations. 

&#160; 

Pharmacy Regulation 

&#160; 

Our pharmacy operations are regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing pharmacy operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding pharmacy operations. These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that state&#8217;s board of pharmacy. In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies. If our pharmacy operations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in some states could be limited. 

&#160; 

Many of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. To the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to our operations, we believe we comply with them. 

&#160; 

Further, under federal law, Section 503A of the FDCA seeks to limit the amount of compounded products that a pharmacy can dispense interstate. The interpretation and enforcement of this provision is dependent on the FDA entering into a standard Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each state setting forth limits on interstate compounding. The current draft standard MOU presented by the FDA in February 2015 would limit interstate shipments of compounded drug units to 30% of all compounded and non-compounded units dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy per month. The FDA has stated in guidance issued in February 2015 that it will not enforce interstate restrictions until after it publishes a final standard MOU and has made it available to states for signature for some designated period of time. If the final standard MOU is not signed by a particular state, then interstate shipments of compounded preparations from a pharmacy located in that state would be limited to quantities not greater than 5% of total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy (the 5% rule); however, we are not aware that the FDA currently enforces or has in the past enforced the 5% rule and, under current draft guidance, the FDA has stated that it will not enforce the 5% rule until a standard MOU has been made available to states for signature. The FDA has proposed a 180-day period for states to agree to the standard MOU after the final version is presented, after which it would begin to enforce the 5% rule. Until a final MOU is issued and presented to states to consider, the extent of interstate dispensing restrictions imposed by Section 503A is unknown. However, if the final standard MOU contains a 30% limit on interstate distribution or if the FDA begins to enforce the 5% rule, our pharmacy operations could be materially limited. 

&#160; 

Certain provisions of the FDCA govern the preparation, handling, storage, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) clarifies and strengthens the federal regulatory framework governing compounding pharmacies. Title 1 of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act, modifies provisions of the Section 503A of the FDCA that were found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. In general, Section 503A provides that pharmacies are exempt from the provisions of the FDCA requiring compliance with cGMP, labeling with adequate directions for use and FDA approval prior to marketing if the pharmacy complies with certain other requirements. Among other things, to comply with Section 503A, a compounded drug must be compounded by a licensed pharmacist for an identified individual patient on the basis of a valid prescription. Pharmacies may only compound in limited quantities before receipt of a prescription for an individual patient and are subject to limitations on anticipatory compounding for distribution, which generally permit anticipatory compounding only based on historical prescription volumes. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The DQSA also contained new Section 503B of the FDCA, which established an outsourcing facility as a new form of entity that is permitted to compound large quantities of drug formulations without a prescription, thus permitting the practice of anticipatory compounding, and distribute them out of state without limitation, if the drug formulations appear on the FDA&#8217;s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appear on a &#8220;clinical need&#8221; list to be established by the FDA. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to cGMP requirements and regular FDA inspection, among other requirements. As described above, our current pharmacy operations comply with Section 503A of the FDCA, and we are undergoing efforts to construct and register two facilities as outsourcing facilities under Section 503B of the FDCA. 

&#160; 

Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA 

&#160; 

Our pharmacy operations involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy and other health-related information. In addition, we use aggregated and blinded (anonymous) data for research and analysis purposes. The federal privacy regulations under HIPAA are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires compliance with federal security regulations regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to electronic protected health information. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information that is not health-related. Further, several states have enacted more protective and comprehensive pharmacy-related privacy legislation that not only applies to patient records but also prohibits the transfer or use for commercial purposes of pharmacy data that identifies prescribers. These regulations impose substantial requirements on covered entities and their business associates regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to personal health and non-health information. Many of these laws apply to our business. 

&#160; 

Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older and for some disabled persons with certain specific conditions. State-funded Medicaid programs provide medical benefits to groups of low-income and disabled individuals, some of whom may have inadequate or no medical insurance. Currently, most of our commercially available formulations are sold in cash transactions and our customers may choose to seek reimbursement opportunities from Medicare, Medicaid and other third parties to the extent that they exist. As part of our Imprimis Cares initiative, we work with third-party insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and buying groups to offer patient-specific customizable compounded formulations at accessible prices. We plan to continue to devote time and other resources to seek reimbursement and patient pay opportunities for these and other compounded formulations and we have hired pharmacy billers to process certain existing reimbursement opportunities for certain formulations. However, we may be unsuccessful in achieving these goals, as many third-party payors have imposed significant restrictions on reimbursement for compounded formulations in recent years. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Health Reform Law may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could conceivable have a material effect on our business. As a result, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may never be available for any of our products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points. 

&#160; 

To the extent we obtain third-party reimbursement for our compounded formulations, we may become subject to Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims. 

&#160; 

FDA New Drug Application Process 

&#160; 

We may choose, alone or with project partners, to pursue FDA approval to market and sell one or more of our formulations through the FDA&#8217;s new drug application (NDA) process. Since the active pharmaceutical ingredients in all of our formulations have already been approved by the FDA, we could choose to pursue FDA approval of one or more of our formulations under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA&#8217;s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be performed for the new product and included in the NDA. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA&#8217;s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book publication. As a condition of approval, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require further studies, including Phase 4 post-marketing studies, to provide additional data. Other post-marketing studies may be required to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA or other regulatory authorities require post-marketing reporting to monitor the adverse effects of a drug. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of a product. 

&#160; 

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, fines and potential civil and criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

International Regulation 

&#160; 

If we pursue commercialization of our proprietary formulations in countries other than the United States, then we would need to obtain the approvals required by the regulatory authorities of such foreign countries that are comparable to the FDA and state boards of pharmacy, and we would be subject to a variety of other foreign statutes and regulations comparable to those relating to our U.S. operations. Regulatory frameworks and requirements vary by country and could involve significant additional licensing requirements and product testing and review periods. 

&#160; 

Environmental and Other Matters 

&#160; 

We are or may become subject to environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and preparation of our formulations. In addition, we are subject to work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, licenses or permits, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Expenses 

&#160; 

Our research and development expenses incurred in 2014 and 2015 primarily include expenses related to the development of intellectual property and researcher and investigator-initiated evaluations and research related primarily to our ophthalmic formulations and certain other assets. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $332,000 in research and development expenses, as compared to $237,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 2, 2016, we employed 112 employees, of which 106 are full-time employees and 6 are part-time employees. Our employees are engaged in pharmacy operations, sales, marketing, research, development, and general and administrative functions. We expect to add additional employees in all departmental functions as we carry out our business plan in the next 12 months. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements with any of our employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe our employee relations are good. We hire independent contractor labor and consultants on an as-needed basis. 

&#160; 

Company Information 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Delaware in January 2006 as Bywater Resources, Inc. In September 2007, we closed a merger transaction with Transdel Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc. and changed our name to Transdel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We changed our name to Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in February 2012. 

&#160; 

On June 26, 2011, we suspended our operations and filed a voluntary petition for reorganization relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of California, Case No. 11-10497-11. On December 8, 2011, in connection with our entry into a line of credit agreement and securities purchase agreement with a third party, our voluntary petition for reorganization relief was dismissed. 

&#160; 

In April 2014, January 2015 and August 2015, we completed our acquisitions of the capital stock Pharmacy Creations, Park and ImprimisRx TX, respectively. In October 2015, ImprimisRx PA acquired substantially all of the assets of Thousand Oaks Holding Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Our executive offices are located at 12264 El Camino Real, Suite 350, San Diego, California 92130 and our telephone number at such office is (858) 704-4040. Our website address is imprimispharma.com. Information contained on our website is not deemed part of this Annual Report.
