 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

Overview 

Granite Falls Energy, LLC is a Minnesota limited liability company formed on December 29, 2000. Our production operations are carried out at our ethanol plant located in Granite Falls, Minnesota and at the ethanol plant operated by our majority owned subsidiary, Heron Lake BioEnergy, LLC ("Heron Lake BioEnergy" or "HLBE"), near Heron Lake, Minnesota. As of January 27, 2016 , we own approximately 50.6% &#32;of the outstanding membership units of HLBE. As a result of our majority ownership, we have the right to appoint five (5) of the nine (9) governors to HLBE's board of governors under its member control agreement. 

The GFE plant has an annual production capacity of 60 million gallons of denatured ethanol, but is currently permitted to produce up to 70 million gallons of undenatured ethanol on a twelve month rolling sum basis. The HLBE plant has an approximate annual production capacity of 60 million gallons of denatured ethanol. On July 10, 2015, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency approved a major amendment to HLBE's air emission permit which increased its permitted production capacity from 59.9 million gallons to approximately 72.3 million gallons of undenatured fuel-grade ethanol on a twelve-month rolling sum basis. We intend to continue working toward increasing production to take advantage of the additional production allowed pursuant to our permits as long as we believe it is profitable to do so. 

Several upscaling projects will be required to increase the HLBE plant's current production capacity and take full advantage of the additional production allowed under our amended air permit. One such project includes replacing our existing regenerative thermal oxidizer ("RTO"). HLBE estimates that the total capital commitment for the new RTO will be approximately $1.9 million and have made down payment of approximately $375,000 to secure the equipment order. Once installed, the new RTO will improve emissions control and allow HLBE to continue to maintain applicable regulatory compliance. HLBE expects completion of this project during the latter part of fiscal year 2016. 

HLBE owns a controlling 73% interest in Agrinatural Gas, LLC ("Agrinatural"), through its wholly owned subsidiary, HLBE Pipeline Company, LLC. The remaining 27% non-controlling interest is owned by Rural Energy Solutions, LLC ("RES"). Agrinatural is a natural gas pipeline company that was formed to construct, own, and operate the natural gas pipeline that provides natural gas to HLBE's ethanol production facility and other customers through a connection with the natural gas pipeline facilities of Northern Border Pipeline Company in Cottonwood County, Minnesota. 

&#160; 

On December 18, 2014, our board of governors declared a distribution of $1,050 per membership unit for a total of approximately $32.1 million to be paid to members of record as of December 18, 2014. The distribution was paid on January 9, 2015. 

Subsequent to the end of our 2015 fiscal year, on December 17, 2015, our board of governors declared a distribution of $315 per membership unit for a total of approximately $9.6 million to be paid to members of record as of December 17, 2015. The distribution was paid on January 25, 2016. Based on the covenants contained in our credit facilities, the foregoing distribution was approved by our lender prior to distribution. 

On December 18, 2014, HLBE's board of governors declared a distribution of $0.12 per membership unit to a total of approximately $9.4 million to be paid to HLBE's members of record as of December 18, 2014. Based on our unit ownership in HLBE, GFE's share of the HLBE distribution was $4.7 million. The distribution was paid on January 19, 2015. 

Subsequent to the end of HLBE's 2015 fiscal year, on December 17, 2015, its board of governors declared a distribution of $0.05 per membership unit for a total of approximately $3.9 million to be paid to members of record as of December 17, 2015. The distribution was paid on January 25, 2016. Based on the covenants contained in HLBE's AgStar credit facilities, the foregoing distribution was approved by its lender prior to distribution. 

Operating Segments 

&#160; 

Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 280, &#8220;Segment Reporting,&#8221; establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our revenues from operations come from three primary sources: sales of fuel ethanol, sales of distillers' grains and sales of corn oil at GFE's ethanol plant and HLBE's ethanol plant. Therefore, in applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, the Company determined that based on the nature of the products and production process and the expected financial results, the Company&#8217;s operations at its ethanol plant and HLBE's plant, including the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products, are aggregated into one reporting segment. 

Additionally, we also realize relatively immaterial revenue from natural gas pipeline operations at HLBE's majority owned subsidiary, Agrinatural. These revenues from Agrinatural's represent less than less than 1% of our consolidated revenues and have little to no impact on the overall performance of the Company. Therefore, our management does not separately review Agrinatural's revenues, cost of sales or other operating performance information. Rather, management reviews Agrinatural's natural gas pipeline financial data on a consolidated basis with our ethanol production operating segment. Additionally, management believes that the presentation of separate operating performance information for Agrinatural's natural gas pipeline operations would not provide meaningful information to a reader of the Company&#8217;s financial statements and would not achieve the basic principles and objectives of ASC 280. 

We currently do not have or anticipate we will have any other lines of business or other significant sources of revenue other than the sale of ethanol and its co-products, which include distillers' grains and non-edible corn oil. 

Financial Information 

Please refer to &#8220; Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8221; for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements, and total assets and liabilities and &#8220; Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8221; for our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data. 

Principal Products 

The principal products from ethanol production at our plant and HLBE's plant, and from which we derive nearly all our revenue, are fuel-grade ethanol, distillers' grains, and non-edible corn oil. In addition, HLBE's plant also has miscellaneous other revenue generated by sales of corn syrup, a by-product of the ethanol production process, and revenues from Agrinatural's natural gas pipeline operations. We did not introduce any new products or services as part of our ethanol production segment during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 . 

The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributable to each of our principal products for each of the last three fiscal years.

Ethanol 

Ethanol is a type of alcohol produced in the United States principally from corn. Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn in the United States but can also be produced from various other grains. Ethanol is primarily used as: 

&#8226; an octane enhancer in fuels; 

&#8226; an oxygenated fuel additive that can reduce ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions; 

&#8226; a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute; and 

&#8226; as a renewable fuel to displace consumption of imported oil. 

&#160; 

Ethanol produced in the United States is primarily used for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products as an octane enhancer or fuel additive. Ethanol is most commonly sold as E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), which is the blend of ethanol approved by the EPA for use in all American automobiles. Increasingly, ethanol is also available as E85, a higher percentage ethanol blend (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) approved by the EPA for use in flexible fuel vehicles. 

Distillers' Grains 

The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers' grains, a high protein and high-energy animal feed ingredient primarily marketed to the dairy, swine, poultry and beef industries. Distillers grains contain by-pass protein that is superior to other protein supplements such as cottonseed meal and soybean meal. By-pass proteins are more digestible to the animal, thus generating greater lactation in milk cows and greater weight gain in beef cattle and swine. Distillers grains can also be included in the rations of breeder hens and laying hens which can potentially contain up to 20% and 15% percent distillers' grains, respectively. 

Dry mill ethanol processing creates three primary forms of distillers' grains: wet distillers' grains, modified wet distillers' grains, and dried distillers' grains with solubles. Most of the distillers' grains that we sell are in the form of dried distillers' grains. Dried distillers' grains with solubles are corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% moisture. It has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market and fed to almost all types of livestock. 

Corn Oil 

Since the installation of a corn oil extraction system in May 2008 at the GFE plant and in February 2012 at the HLBE plant, we have been able to extract non-edible crude corn oil during the thin stillage evaporation process immediately prior to production of distillers&#8217; grains. Corn oil is produced by processing evaporated thin stillage through a disk stack style centrifuge. Corn oil has a lower density than the water or solids that make up the corn syrup. The centrifuges separate the relatively light oil from the heavier components of the corn syrup, eliminating the need for significant retention time. Corn oil is used primarily as a biodiesel feedstock and as a supplement for animal feed. 

Generally, we return the de-oiled syrup into the production process adding it to the modified, or dry distillers&#8217; grains during the drying process. However, HLBE occasionally sells excess corn syrup in liquid syrup form to livestock feeders. Excess syrup results from a plant upset, or when the amount of syrup produced during evaporation process exceeds our distillers' grains' dryer capacity. Corn syrup is used primarily as a feed additive to moisten dry feed stuffs such as hay. 

Principal Product Markets 

As described below in &#8220; Distribution of Principal Products, &#8221; we market and distribute all of our ethanol and all of our distillers' grains shipped by rail through professional third party marketers. Our ethanol and distillers' grains marketers make all decisions with regard to where our products are marketed. Our ethanol and distillers' grains are primarily sold in the domestic market. As distillers' grains become more accepted as an animal feed substitute throughout the world, distillers' grains exporting may increase. 

We expect our ethanol and distillers' grains marketers to explore all markets for our products, including export markets. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect our products to continue to be marketed primarily domestically. 

Ethanol Markets 

There are local, regional, national, and international markets for ethanol. Our products are primarily sold in the domestic market. The principal markets for our ethanol are petroleum terminals in the continental United States. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally wholesale gasoline distributors or blenders. 

We believe that local markets will be limited and must typically be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Although local markets may be the easiest to service, they may be oversold because of the number of ethanol producers near our plant, which may depress the price of ethanol in those markets. 

Typically, a regional market is one that is outside of the local market, yet within the neighboring states. Some regional markets include large cities that are subject to anti-smog measures in either carbon monoxide or ozone non-attainment areas, or that have implemented oxygenated gasoline programs, such as Chicago, St. Louis, Denver, and Minneapolis. We consider our primary regional market to be large cities within a 450-mile radius of our ethanol plant. In the national ethanol market, the highest demand by volume is primarily in the southern United States and the east and west coast regions. 

However, as domestic production of ethanol continues to expand, we anticipate increased international sales. Ethanol export demand, however, tends to fluctuate due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies and monetary and political policies in other nations. During our 2015 fiscal year, exports of ethanol produced in the U.S. with Canada as the leading importer, followed by Brazil, India, the Philippines, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates. 

The markets in which our ethanol is sold will depend primarily upon the efforts of Eco-Energy, Inc. (&#8220;Eco-Energy&#8221;), which buys and markets our ethanol. We expect Eco-Energy to explore all markets for our ethanol, including export markets. However, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect a majority of our ethanol to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. 

We transport our ethanol primarily by rail. In addition to rail, we service certain regional markets by truck from time to time. We believe that regional pricing tends to follow national pricing less the freight difference. 

Over the past several years, there has been an increase in rail traffic congestion throughout the United States primarily due to the increase in cargo trains carrying shale oil from the North Dakota Bakkan oil fields. From time to time, this congestion has affected many ethanol plants' ability to ship ethanol on a timely basis and caused those plants to slow or suspend production. As of the date of this report, our plant has not experienced any material delays from the rail congestion problems. Delays in returning rail cars to our plants may affect our ability to operate our plants at full capacity due to ethanol storage capacity constraints. 

Distillers' Grains Markets 

We sell distillers' grains as animal feed for beef and dairy cattle, poultry, and hogs. Most of the distillers' grains that we sell are in the form of dried distillers' grains. Currently, the United States ethanol industry exports a significant amount of dried distiller grains. During our 2015 fiscal year, the largest importers of United States distiller grains were China, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam and Canada. In June 2014, China announced that it would stop issuing import permits for United States distillers' grains due to the presence of a genetically modified trait that was not approved by China for import. This announcement was followed in July 2014 by a new certification requirement that distiller grains shipments to China were free of the genetically modified corn trait. As a result, distillers' grains exports to China decreased during the second half of 2014. However, in December 2014, China lifted the June 2014 ban and the Chinese export market rebounded in early 2015 only to diminish in recent months. Further, a new registration requirement for Chinese importers of distillers grains began on September 1, 2015 which may result in a decline in export demand for distillers grains and declines in the price of distillers' grains in the United States, which could impact our ability to profitably operate. 

We also sell modified wet distillers' grains, which typically have a shelf life of a maximum of fourteen days. This provides for a much smaller, more local market and makes the timing of its sale critical. Further, because of its moisture content, the modified wet distillers' grains are heavier and more difficult to handle. The customer must be close enough to justify the additional handling and shipping costs. As a result, modified wet distillers' grains are principally sold only to local feedlots and livestock operations. 

Various factors affect the price of distillers' grain, including, among others, the price of corn, soybean meal and other alternative feed products, the performance or value of distillers' grains in a particular feed market, and the supply and demand within the market. Like other commodities, the price of distillers' grains can fluctuate significantly. 

Corn Oil Markets 

Our corn oil is primarily sold to diesel manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, feed lot and poultry markets. We generally transport our corn oil by truck to users located primarily in the upper Midwest. 

Distribution of Principal Products 

Our ethanol plant is located near Granite Falls, Minnesota, in Chippewa County. We selected the Granite Falls site because of its accessibility to road and rail transportation and its proximity to grain supplies. It is served by the TC&#38;W Railway which provides connection to the Canadian Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroads. The completion of our rail loop during our 2012 fiscal year enables us to load unit trains. Our site is in close proximity to major highways that connect to major population centers such as Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; and Detroit, Michigan. 

The ethanol plant owned by HLBE is located near Heron Lake, Minnesota. The HBLE ethanol plant has the facilities necessary to load ethanol and distillers' grains onto trucks and rail cars. It is served by the Union Pacific Railroad. HLBE's site is also in close proximity to major highways that connect to major population centers such as Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; and Detroit, Michigan. 

Ethanol Distribution 

Eco-Energy is our ethanol marketer for both the Granite Falls plant and the HLBE plant. Pursuant to the agreements we have with Eco-Energy, it has agreed to market the entire ethanol output of our ethanol plants and to arrange for the transportation of ethanol. We pay Eco-Energy a fixed fee per gallon of ethanol sole in consideration of Eco-Energy's services. 

Distillers' Grains Distribution 

Since February 1, 2011, RPMG, Inc. (&#8220;RPMG&#8221;) has served as the distillers' grains marketer for our Granite Falls plant. Pursuant to this agreement, RPMG markets all the distillers' grains produced at our Granite Falls plant. 

Gavilon Ingredients, LLC ("Gavilon") serves as the distillers' grains marketer for HLBE pursuant to an off-take agreement that became effective as of November 1, 2013. Under this agreement, Gavilon purchases all of the distillers' grains produced at our Heron Lake ethanol plant in exchange for a service fee. 

Corn Oil Distribution 

RPMG is also our corn oil marketer for both the Granite Falls plant and the HLBE plant. Currently, RPMG markets our corn oil, which is used primarily as a biodiesel feedstock and as a supplement for animal feed. We pay RPMG a commission based on each pound of corn oil sold by RPMG under the agreement. 

New Products and Services 

We did not introduce any new products or services during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 . 

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers 

As discussed above, we have exclusive ethanol marketing agreements with Eco-Energy. Additionally, we have agreements with RPMG and Gavilon to market all of the distillers' grains produced at our plant and HLBE's plant, respectively and with RPMG to market all of the corn oil. We rely on Eco-Energy, RPMG and Gavilon for the sale and distribution of all of our products; therefore, we are highly dependent on Eco-Energy, RPMG and Gavilon for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of these companies as our marketing agents for our ethanol, distillers' grains, or corn oil could have a negative impact on our revenues. 

Seasonality of Ethanol Sales 

We experience some seasonality of demand for our ethanol. Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand. 

Pricing of Corn and Ethanol 

We expect that ethanol sales will represent our primary revenue source and corn will represent our primary component of cost of goods sold. Therefore, changes in the price at which we can sell the ethanol we produce and the price at which we buy corn for our ethanol plant present significant operational risks inherent in our business. 

Generally, the price at which ethanol can be sold does not track with the price at which corn can be bought. Historically, ethanol prices have tended to correlate with wholesale gasoline prices, with demand for and the price of ethanol increasing as supplies of petroleum decreased or appeared to be threatened, crude oil prices increased and wholesale gasoline prices increased. However, the prices of both ethanol and corn do not always follow historical trends. Trends in ethanol prices and corn prices are subject to a number of factors and are difficult to predict. 

Hedging 

GFE and HLBE may hedge anticipated corn purchases and ethanol and distillers' grain sales through a variety of mechanisms. 

The grain supply for our Granite Falls plant is obtained from Farmers Cooperative Elevator Company ("FCE"), our exclusive grain procurement agent. HLBE purchases its corn directly from grain elevators, farmers, and local dealers within approximately 80 miles of Heron Lake, Minnesota. 

HLBE procures corn through spot cash, fixed-price forward, basis only, futures only, and delayed pricing contracts. Additionally, HLBE may use hedging positions in the corn futures and options market to manage the risk of excessive corn price fluctuations for a portion of our corn requirements. 

For its spot purchases, HLBE posts daily corn bids so that corn producers can sell to HLBE on a spot basis. HLE's fixed-price forward contracts specify the amount of corn, the price and the time period over which the corn is to be delivered. These forward contracts are at fixed prices indexed to Chicago Board of Trade, or CBOT, prices. HLBE's corn requirements can be contracted in advance under fixed-price forward contracts or options. The parameters of these contracts are based on the local supply and demand situation and the seasonality of the price. For delayed pricing contracts, producers will deliver corn to HLBE, but the pricing for that corn and the related payment will occur at a later date. 

To hedge a portion of GFE's and HLBE's exposure to corn price risk, GFE and HLBE may buy and sell futures and options positions on the CBOT. In addition, both plants' facilities have sufficient corn storage capacity, with the capability to store approximately 10 days of corn supply at each plant. 

Eco-Energy is the exclusive marketer for all of the ethanol produced at the GFE and HLBE facilities. To mitigate ethanol price risk and to obtain the best margins on ethanol that is marketed and sold by our marketer, GFE and HLBE may utilize ethanol swaps, over-the-counter ("OTC") ethanol swaps, or OTC ethanol options that are typically settled in cash, rather than gallons of the ethanol produced at the respective plant. 

Our marketing and risk management committee assists the board and our risk management personnel to, among other things, establish appropriate policies and strategies for hedging and enterprise risk. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

The primary raw materials used in the production of ethanol at our plant are corn and natural gas. Our ethanol plant also requires significant and uninterrupted amounts of electricity and water. We have entered into agreements for our supply of electricity, natural gas, and water. 

Corn Procurement 

The cost of corn represented approximately 73.6% , 71.0%, and 82.5% &#32;of our cost of sales for the years ended October 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

Ethanol production requires substantial amounts of corn. To produce approximately 60 million gallons of undenatured ethanol per year our Granite Falls ethanol plant needs approximately 21.5 million bushels of corn per year, or approximately 60,000 bushels per day, as the feedstock for its dry milling process. The grain supply for our Granite Falls plant is obtained from FCE, our exclusive grain procurement agent. Our members are not obligated to deliver corn to our Granite Falls plant. We will be forced to seek alternative corn suppliers if FCE cannot meet our needs. The term of our agreement with FCE expires in November 2017. 

Our board of directors have approved management&#8217;s proposal of two projects at GFE's plant: (1) installation of a second rail loop which will expand GFE's rail capabilities by allowing us to stage an additional unit train at the GFE plant; and (2) construction of additional grain storage which will increase GFE&#8217;s corn storage capacity by approximately 750,000 bushels. The rail loop expansion project was commenced during the second fiscal quarter of 2015 and was completed during the third fiscal quarter of 2015. 

The grain storage expansion project is expected to cost approximately $2.7 million. In connection with this project, GFE executed a construction agreement dated April 8, 2015 with Buresh Building Systems, Inc. to construct an additional grain bin. The grain storage expansion project commenced initial site work in August 2015 and is expected to be completed during the first half of our 2016 fiscal year. 

The HLBE ethanol plant requires approximately 21.0 million bushels of corn per year to operate at is current production rate of 61 million gallons of undenatured ethanol per year. Typically, HLBE purchases its corn directly from grain elevators, farmers, and local dealers within approximately 80 miles of Heron Lake, Minnesota. 

Generally, higher corn prices will produce lower profit margins and, therefore, negatively affect our financial performance. If a period of high corn prices were to be sustained for some time, such pricing may reduce our ability to operate profitably because of the higher cost of operating our plants. We may not be able to offset any increase in the price of corn by increasing the price of our products. If we cannot offset increases in the price of corn, our financial performance may be negatively affected. 

We generally purchase corn for both the GFE and HLBE plants through spot cash, fixed-price forward, basis only, and futures only contracts and may utilize hedging positions in the corn futures market for a portion of our corn requirements to manage the risk of excessive corn price fluctuations. Our fixed-price forward contracts specify the amount of corn, the price and the time period over which the corn is to be delivered. These forward contracts are at fixed prices or prices based on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) prices. Our corn requirements can be forward contracted on either a fixed-price basis or futures only contracts. The parameters of these contracts are based on the local supply and demand situation and the seasonality of the price. We also purchase a portion of our corn on a spot basis. 

The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuation depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices generally. These include, among others, crop conditions, crop production, weather, government programs, and export demands. We can attempt to mitigate fluctuations in the corn and ethanol markets by locking in a favorable margin through the use of hedging activities, including forward contracts. However, we are not always presented with an opportunity to lock in a favorable margin and our plant's profitability may be negatively impacted during periods of high grain prices. 

Utilities 

Natural Gas &#32; 

Natural gas is a significant input to our manufacturing process. The cost of natural gas represented approximately 6.7% , 9.4% , and 4.2% &#32;of our cost of sales for the years ended October 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

At our Granite Falls plant, we pay Center Point Energy/Minnegasco a per unit fee to move the natural gas through the pipeline, and we have guaranteed to move a minimum of 1,500,000 mmBTU annually through December 31, 2025, which is the ending date of the agreement. We also have an agreement with U.S. Energy Services, Inc. On our behalf, U.S. Energy Services procures contracts with various natural gas vendors to supply the natural gas necessary to operate the plant. We determined that sourcing our natural gas from a variety of vendors is more cost-efficient than using an exclusive supplier. 

HLBE has a facilities agreement with Northern Border Pipeline Company, which allows HLBE to access to an existing interstate natural gas pipeline located approximately 16 miles north from its plant. HLBE has entered into a firm natural gas transportation agreement with its majority owned subsidiary, Agrinatural. Under the terms of the firm natural gas transportation agreement, Agrinatural will provide natural gas to the HLBE plant with a specified price per MMBTU for an initial term of 10 years, with two automatic renewal options for five years periods. On July 1, 2014, HLBE entered into an amendment of this agreement pursuant to which it agreed on an early exercise of one of the two automatic five-year term renewals thereby extending the term of the firm natural gas transportation agreement to October 31, 2021. HLBE also has a base agreement for the sale and purchase of natural gas with Constellation NewEnergy&#8212;Gas Division, LLC ("Constellation"). HLBE buys all of its natural gas from Constellation and this agreement runs through March 31, 2016. 

The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond our control such as higher prices as a result of colder than average weather conditions or natural disasters, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulations and relations. Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair our ability to manufacture ethanol and more significantly, dried distillers' grains for our customers. Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

Electricity &#32; 

Our plants require a continuous supply of electricity. We have agreements in place to supply electricity to our plants. 

Water 

We obtain the water necessary to operate the GFE plant from the Minnesota River with an adjustable gravity-flow intake system. 

HLBE obtains its water pursuant to an industrial water supply agreement with the City of Heron Lake and Jackson County, Minnesota. 

Process Improvement 

We are continually working to develop new methods of operating the ethanol plants more efficiently. We continue to conduct process improvement activities in order to realize these efficiency improvements. 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions 

We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises, or concessions. We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. ("ICM") to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plants. 

Competition 

Producers of Ethanol 

We sell our ethanol in a highly competitive market. Ethanol is a commodity product where competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. 

We are in direct competition with numerous ethanol producers, many of whom have greater resources than we do. While management believes we are a lower cost producer of ethanol, some of these producers are, among other things, capable of producing a significantly greater amount of ethanol or own or manage more ethanol than we do which that may help them achieve certain benefits that we could not achieve with our ethanol plants. Further, new products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could provide them competitive advantages over us and harm our business. 

Following the significant growth in the ethanol industry during 2005 and 2006, the ethanol industry has grown at a much slower pace. As of November 13, 2015 , the RFA estimates that there are 213 &#32;ethanol production facilities in the United States with capacity to produce approximately 15.5 billion &#32;gallons of ethanol and another 1 &#32;plant under expansion or construction with capacity to produce an additional 80 &#32;million gallons per year. However, the RFA estimates that approximately 3% &#32;of the ethanol production capacity in the United States was not operating as of November 13, 2015 . 

The largest ethanol producers include: Abengoa Bioenergy Corp.; Archer Daniels Midland Company; Cargill, Inc.; Flint Hills Resources, LP; Green Plains, Inc.; POET, LLC and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. These larger ethanol producers may be able to take advantages of economies of scale due to their larger size and increased bargaining power with both customers and raw material suppliers. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers. 

The following table identifies the largest ethanol producers in the United States along with their production capacities.

A majority of the United States ethanol plants, and therefore, the greatest number of gallons of ethanol production capacity, are concentrated in the corn-producing states of Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, South Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, Kansas, and North Dakota.

Because Minnesota is one of the top producers of ethanol in the United States, we face increased competition because of the location of our ethanol plants. There are eight ethanol plants within an approximate 50 mile radius of the HLBE plant with a combined ethanol capacity of 586 million gallons and five ethanol plants within an approximate radius of the GFE plant with a combined ethanol capacity of 310 &#32;million gallons. Therefore, we compete with other local ethanol producers both for markets in Minnesota and markets in other states. We believe that we are able to reach the best available markets through the use of our experienced marketer and by the rail delivery methods we use. We believe that we can compete favorably with other ethanol producers due to our proximity to ample grain, natural gas, electricity and water supplies at favorable prices. 

In addition to intense competition with local, regional, and national producers of ethanol, we have faced increased competition from imported ethanol and foreign producers of ethanol, most likely due to the expiration of the 2.5 percent ad valorem tax and an additional 54 cents a gallon surcharge in December 2011. Although ethanol imports have decreased since 2012, if demand for imported ethanol were to increase again, demand for domestic ethanol may be reduced, which could lead to lower domestic prices and lower operating margins. 

We anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as the feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn. One type of ethanol production feedstock that is being explored is cellulose. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks and rice straw, amongst other common plants. Several companies and researchers have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol and three companies have announced they have begun producing on a commercial scale this past year. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol, especially when corn prices are high. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process. 

Producers of Other Fuel Additives and Alternative Fuels 

In addition to competing with ethanol producers, we also compete with producers of other gasoline oxygenates. Many gasoline oxygenates are produced by other companies, including oil companies, that have far greater resources than we have. Historically, as a gasoline oxygenate, ethanol primarily competed with two gasoline oxygenates, both of which are ether-based: MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) and ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether). Many states have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale of gasoline containing certain levels of MTBE or are phasing out the use of MTBE because of health and environmental concerns. As a result, national use of MTBE has decreased significantly in recent years. Use of ethanol now exceeds that of MTBE and ETBE as a gasoline oxygenate. 

While ethanol has displaced these two gasoline oxygenates, the development of ethers intended for use as oxygenates is continuing and we will compete with producers of any future ethers used as oxygenates. 

A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative clean power systems, both for vehicles and other applications, using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars, or clean-burning gaseous fuels. Like ethanol, the emerging fuel cell industry offers a technological option to address worldwide energy costs, the long-term availability of petroleum reserves, and environmental concerns. Fuel cells have emerged as a potential alternative to certain existing power sources because of their higher efficiency, reduced noise and lower emissions. Fuel cell industry participants are currently targeting the transportation, stationary power, and portable power markets in order to decrease fuel costs, lessen dependence on crude oil, and reduce harmful emissions. If the fuel cell industry continues to expand and gain broad acceptance and becomes readily available to consumers for motor vehicle use, we may not be able to compete effectively. This additional competition could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability. 

Additionally, there are more than a dozen alternative and advanced fuels currently in development, production or use, including the following alternative fuels that, like ethanol, have been or are currently commercially available for vehicles: 

&#8226; 

biodiesel 

&#8226; 

electricity 

&#8226; 

hydrogen 

&#8226; 

methanol 

&#8226; 

natural gas 

&#8226; 

propane 

Several emerging fuels are currently under development. Many of these fuels are also considered alternative fuels and may have other benefits such as reduced emissions or decreasing dependence upon oil. Examples of emerging fuels include: 

&#8226; 

Biobutanol: Like ethanol, biobutanol is an alcohol that can be produced through the processing of domestically grown crops, such as corn and sugar beets, and other biomass, such as fast-growing grasses and agricultural waste products. 

&#8226; 

Biogas: Biogas is produced from the anaerobic digestion of organic matter such as animal manure, sewage, and municipal solid waste. After it is processed to required standards of purity, biogas becomes a renewable substitute for natural gas and can be used to fuel natural gas vehicles. 

&#8226; 

Fischer-Tropsch Diesel: Diesel made by converting gaseous hydrocarbons, such as natural gas and gasified coal or biomass, into liquid fuel, including transportation fuel. 

&#8226; 

Hydrogenation-Derived Renewable Diesel (HDRD): The product of fats or vegetable oils&#8212;alone or blended with petroleum&#8212;that has been refined in an oil refinery. 

&#8226; 

P-Series: A blend of natural gas liquids (pentanes plus), ethanol, and the biomass-derived co-solvent methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) formulated to be used in flexible fuel vehicles. 

&#8226; 

Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel: This is diesel fuel with 15 parts per million or lower sulfur content. This ultra-low sulfur content enables the use of advanced emission control technologies on vehicles using ULSD fuels produced from non-petroleum and renewable sources that are considered alternative fuels. 

Additionally, there are developed and developing technologies for converting natural gas, coal, and biomass to liquid fuel, including transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and methanol. We expect that competition will increase between ethanol producers and producers of these or other newly developed alternative fuels or power systems, especially to the extent they are used in similar applications such as vehicles. 

Producers of Distillers' Grains 

The amount of distillers' grains produced annually in North America has increased significantly as the number of ethanol plants increased. We compete with other producers of distillers' grains products both locally and nationally, with more intense competition for sales of distillers' grains among ethanol producers in close proximity to our ethanol plants. As of the date of this report there are eight ethanol plants within an approximate 50 mile radius of the HLBE plant with a combined distillers grain production capacity of approximately 1.8 million tons and five ethanol plants within an approximate radius of the GFE plant with a combined distillers grains production capacity of approximately 895,000 tons. These competitors may be more likely to sell to the same markets that we target for our distillers' grains. 

Additionally, distillers' grains compete with other feed formulations, including corn gluten feed, dry brewers' grain, and mill feeds. The primary value of these products as animal feed is their protein content. Dry brewers' grain and distillers' grains have about the same protein content, and corn gluten feed and mill feeds have slightly lower protein contents. Distillers' grains contain nutrients, fat content, and fiber that we believe will differentiate our distillers' grains products from other feed formulations. However, producers of other forms of animal feed may also have greater experience and resources than we do, and their products may have greater acceptance among producers of beef and dairy cattle, poultry, and hogs. 

Competition for Corn 

We will compete with ethanol producers in close proximity for the supplies of corn we will require to operate our plants. The existence of other ethanol plants, particularly those in close proximity to our plants, increase the demand for corn and may result in higher costs for supplies of corn. There are eight ethanol plants within an approximate 50 mile radius of HLBE's plant that will use approximately 211 million bushels of corn during production, assuming they are operating at their name plate capacity, and five ethanol plants within an approximate radius of the GFE plant that will use approximately 105 &#32;million bushels of corn during production, assuming they are operating at their name plate capacity. 

We compete with other users of corn, including ethanol producers regionally and nationally, producers of food and food ingredients for human consumption (such as high fructose corn syrup, starches, and sweeteners), producers of animal feed and industrial users. 

Competition for Personnel 

We will also compete with ethanol producers in close proximity for the personnel we will require to operate our plants. The existence and development of other ethanol plants will increase competition for qualified managers, engineers, operators and other personnel. We also compete for personnel with businesses other than ethanol producers and with businesses located within the Granite Falls and Heron Lake, Minnesota communities. 

Demand for Ethanol 

In recent years, the demand for ethanol has increased, particularly in the upper Midwest, in part because of two major programs established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990: the Oxygenated Gasoline Program and the Reformulated Gasoline Program. Under these programs, an additive (oxygenate) is required to be blended with gasoline used in areas with excessive carbon monoxide or ozone pollution to help mitigate these conditions. Because of the potential health and environmental issues associated with MTBE and the actions of the EPA, ethanol is now used as the primary oxygenate in those areas requiring an oxygenate additive pursuant to state or federal law. A clean air additive is a substance that, when added to gasoline, reduces tailpipe emissions, resulting in improved air quality characteristics. Ethanol contains 35% oxygen, approximately twice that of MTBE, a historically used oxygenate. The additional oxygen found in ethanol results in more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinder, which reduces tailpipe emissions by as much as 30%, including a 12% reduction in volatile organic compound emissions when blended at a 10% level. Pure ethanol, which is non-toxic, water soluble and biodegradable, replaces some of the harmful gasoline components, including benzene. The United States consumes approximately 135-140 billion gallons of gasoline a year. More than 95% of those gallons were blended with ethanol, predominantly at the E10 level. 

Many in the ethanol industry believe that it will be difficult to meet the federal Renewable Fuels Standard renewable volume obligations in future years without an increase in the percentage of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline for use in standard (non-flex fuel) vehicles. This is commonly referred to as the &#8220;blend wall,&#8221; which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the United States and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends such as E85 used in flex fuel vehicles. 

We believe that the "blend wall" is one of the most critical governmental policies currently facing the ethanol industry. The "blend wall" arises because of several conflicting requirements. First, the renewable fuels standards dictate a continuing increase in the amount of ethanol blended into the national gasoline supply requiring 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels be used annually by 2022. Second, the EPA mandates a limit of 10% ethanol inclusion in non-flex fuel vehicles. E10 is the most common ethanol blend sold and the only blend the EPA has approved for use in all American automobiles. There is growing availability of E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) for use in flexible fuel vehicles, however it is limited due to lacking infrastructure. In addition, the industry has been working to introduce E15 to the retail market since the EPA issued final approval in 2012 for the sale and use of E15 ethanol blends in light duty passenger vehicles model year 2001 and newer. Since that time, our application with the EPA to register ethanol for use in making E15 has also been approved, as well as 81 other fuel manufacturers according to EPA data. However, wide spread adoption of E15 is hampered by regulatory and infrastructure hurdles in many states, as well as consumer acceptance. To date only thirteen states have approved the commercial sale of E15. As such, we do not anticipate that E15 will impact ethanol demand or pricing in the near term. Additionally, sales of E15 may be limited because: (i) it is not approved for use in all vehicles; (ii) the EPA requires a label that management believes may discourage consumers from using E15; and (iii) retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. In addition, different gasoline blendstocks may be required at certain times of the year in order to use E15 due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions. This may prevent E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. As a result, management believes that E15 may not have an immediate impact on ethanol demand in the United States. Rather, management believes consumer acceptance of E15 and flex fuel vehicles, along with continued growth of E85, is necessary before ethanol can achieve any market growth beyond the blend wall. As industry production capacity reaches the blend wall, the supply of ethanol in the market may surpass the demand which in turn may negatively impact prices. 

Government Ethanol Supports 

The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol, the most significant of which is the federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the "RFS"). The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. Under the RFS, the EPA is supposed to pass an annual rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used by blenders in the United States which is called the renewable volume obligations ("RVOs"). On November 30, 2015, the EPA released the long-delayed final renewable volume obligations for corn-based ethanol for 2014 through 2016. The final RVO&#8217;s for corn-based ethanol blending exceeded the RVO reductions initially proposed by the EPA in May 2015, but remained below the original blending requirements set by the RFS. The following chart illustrates the minimum usage established by the RFS statute and the minimums established in the November 30, 2015 final rule:

Current ethanol production capacity exceeds the EPA's 2014, 2015 and 2016 RVO standard which can be satisfied by corn based ethanol. Beyond the federal mandates, there are limited markets for ethanol. Further, opponents of ethanol such as large oil companies will likely continue their efforts to repeal or reduce the RFS through lawsuits or lobbying of Congress. If such efforts are successful in further reducing or repealing the blending requirements of the RFS, a significant decrease in ethanol demand may result and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, unless additional demand from exports or discretionary or E85 blending develops. 

Compliance with Environmental Laws and Other Regulatory Matters 

Our business subjects us to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including: those relating to discharges into the air, water, and ground; the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with numerous permits to construct and operate our ethanol plant, including water, air, and other environmental permits. The costs associated with obtaining these permits and meeting the conditions of these permits have increased our costs of construction and production. Additionally, compliance with environmental laws and permit conditions in the future could require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment, as well as significant management time and expense. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, and/or plant shutdown, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Although violations and environmental non-compliance still remain a possibility following our conversion from coal to natural gas combustion, the exposure to the company has been greatly reduced. 

In the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 , we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $146,000 &#32;and $191,000 &#32;complying with environmental laws, including the cost of pursuing permit amendments, for our Granite Falls plant and Heron Lake plants, respectively. Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations. 

When the EPA released its final regulations on the RFS, the gallons produced by first-generation ethanol plants utilizing corn starch, such as the HLBE plant, were grandfathered to generate Renewable Identification Numbers ("RINs") for compliance with the RFS at its then permitted capacity of 59.2 million gallons per year. However, to generate RINs that qualify for compliance with the RFS program, any new production above the grandfathered gallons must meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS mandate. 

In September 2014, the EPA announced a new expedited petition process, referred to as the "efficient producer" petition, for existing corn starch and grain sorghum ethanol producers to gain pathway approval and qualify to generate RINs for production volumes above those grandfathered under the RFS. On January 13, 2015 and March 30, 2015, HLBE and GFE, respectively, submitted efficient producer petitions to the EPA. The EPA awarded efficient producer pathway approval to HLBE and GFE on March 12, 2015 and May 13, 2015, respectively. In the approval determinations, the EPA's analysis indicated that HLBE achieved at least a 20.1% reduction and GFE achieved a 26.0% reduction in GHG emissions for their non-grandfathered volumes compared to the baseline lifecycle GHG emissions. 

Pursuant to the award approval, HLBE and GFE are only authorized to generate RINs for each plant's non-grandfathered volumes if each plant can demonstrate that all ethanol produced at the plant during an averaging period (defined as the prior 365 days or the number of days since the date EPA efficient producer pathway approval) meets the 20% GHG reduction requirement. To make these demonstrations, HLBE and GFE must develop compliance plans and keep certain records as specified in the approvals. Additionally, the EPA approvals require that HLBE and GFE register with the EPA as a renewable fuel producer for the non-grandfathered volumes and satisfy the registration requirements, which include completing an engineering review by an independent engineer and a submitting the proposed compliance plans for approval. 

As of the date of this report, the required engineering study and proposed compliance plan for each plant has been submitted to the EPA for review and approval. Although we believe GFE and HLBE will be able to satisfactorily complete the registration process, there is no guarantee that we will complete registration timely or at all, or, even if we do, that either plant will be able to maintain continuous compliance with the 20% reduction in GHG emissions requirement. If GFE or HLBE do not complete the required registration or maintain continuous compliance with the 20% reduction in GHG emissions requirement, we will not be able issue RINs for the non-grandfathered volumes of ethanol produced at the plants. As a result, we may be forced to rely on exports sales for these non-grandfathered volumes ethanol, which could adversely affect our operating margins, which, in turn could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

The California Air Resources Board, or CARB, has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013. The practical effect of California's low carbon fuel standard is that it precludes grain-based ethanol from outside California. Federal and state challenges to the LCFS remain ongoing but if ultimately unsuccessful, the LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices. 

In February 2013, an anti-dumping duty was imposed as a regulation by the Council of the European Union. The Company does not export any ethanol to Europe at this time. Continuation of this duty or imposition of tariffs by other countries or regions could reduce United States exports to Europe, and possibly other export markets. A reduction of exports to Europe could have an adverse effect on domestic ethanol prices, as the available supply of ethanol for the domestic market would increase. 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of the date of this report, we have 78 &#32;full time employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants. Fifteen &#32;of these employees are involved primarily in management and administration. The remaining employees are involved primarily in plant operations. We do not currently anticipate any significant change in the number of employees at our plant. 

On July 31, 2013, GFE entered into a Management Services Agreement with HLBE. Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, GFE agreed to provide personnel to act as part-time officers and managers of HLBE for the positions of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Commodity Risk Manager. Each person providing management services to HLBE under the Management Services Agreement is subject to oversight by HLBE's board of governors. However, the Chief Executive Officer is solely responsible for hiring and firing persons providing management services under the Management Services Agreement. 

The initial term of the Management Services Agreement ends on July 30, 2016. Following the initial term, the Management Services Agreement automatically renews for additional one year terms unless either party gives notice of termination at least ninety days before the end of the initial or any renewal term. The Management Services Agreement may also be terminated for cause under certain circumstances. 

GFE is responsible for and agreed to directly pay salary, wages, and/or benefits to the persons providing management services under the Management Services Agreement. HLBE has agreed to pay GFE $35,000 per month for the first year of the Management Services Agreement. During years two and three of the Management Services Agreement, HLBE will pay GFE 50% of the total salary, bonuses and other expenses and costs (including all benefits and tax contributions) incurred by GFE for the three management positions, paid on an estimated monthly basis with a &#8220;true-up&#8221; following the close of our fiscal year. 

Financial Information about Geographic Areas 

All of our operations are domiciled in the United States. All of the products sold to our customers for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;were produced in the United States and all of our long-lived assets are domiciled in the United States. We have engaged third-party professional marketers who decide where our products are marketed and we have no control over the marketing decisions made by our third-party professional marketers. These third-party marketers may decide to sell our products in countries other than the United States. However, we anticipate that our products will primarily be sold in the United States.
