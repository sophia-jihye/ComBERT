Corporate History 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the name Imagine Media, Ltd. on August 10, 2007. From inception through early 2009, our business was to publish and distribute Image Magazine, a monthly entertainment guide for the Denver, Colorado area. We generated only limited revenue and essentially abandoned our business plan in January 2009.

&#160;

On September 19, 2011, we acquired approximately 52% of the outstanding shares of TransBiotec, Inc., ("TBT") from TBT's directors in exchange for 12,416,462 shares of our common stock. These directors of TBT were Charles Bennington, Devadatt Mishal, Nicholas Limer, and Sam Satyanarayana. At the time, these shares represented approximately 52% of our outstanding common stock. TBT was a California corporation. In connection with this transaction, two of our officers resigned and Charles Bennington and Nicholas Limer were appointed as directors and as our President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, and our Secretary, respectively, and Ronald Williams was appointed as our Chief Technology Officer.

&#160;

On January 17, 2012, our Board of Directors amended our Certificate of Incorporation changing our name from Imagine Media, Ltd. to TransBiotec, Inc. On January 31, 2012, we acquired approximately 45% of the remaining outstanding shares of TBT in exchange for 10,973,678 shares of our common stock. In connection with this transaction two of our directors resigned and Sam Satyanarayana, Ronald Williams and Devadatt Mishal were appointed directors. As a result of the September 2011 and January 2012 acquisitions of TBT common stock, we currently own approximately 97% of the outstanding shares of TBT, and we control its board of directors and officer positions. The remaining 3% are owned by non-affiliated individuals that did not participate in the share exchange.

&#160;

As a result of the acquisition, TBT's business is our business and, unless otherwise indicated, any references to "us" or "we" includes the business and operations of TBT. Due to our 97% ownership of TBT, its operations are combined with ours in the attached financial statements.

Business Overview 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are a development stage company that has developed an alcohol detection device called "SOBR". The device is a patented device for use in detecting alcohol in a person's system by testing the ethanol content in their perspiration. We plan to market the device to two primary business segments: (i) companies and institutions that employ or contract with vehicle drivers, where the system will be marketed as a preventative drunk driving detection system, with a possible ignition locking device, and (ii) companies and institutions that have an interest in monitoring their employees' or contractors' alcohol level due to their job responsibilities, such as surgeons prior to entering surgery, pilots prior to flying aircraft, and the military for personnel returning to a military base from off-base leave. Currently, we have several "prototype" units fully-developed that we believe are ready for use, but are also constantly looking for ways to improve the device and will develop it further if we find improvements to the device. 

&#160;

Regarding the use in vehicles, we believe SOBR offers a unique solution to the national drunk driving problem and are currently performing beta testing of SOBR for this use. Our objective is to grow our sales and manufacturing of SOBR by aggressively pursuing the original equipment market ("OEM") once final beta testing is completed. We intend to seek an experienced OEM partner to introduce SOBR to the new automotive market. We believe that an increase in public awareness and consumer interest will generate a demand for alcohol sensing technology and we hope that auto manufactures will begin installing SOBR as a factory installed option. We will also market SOBR to international car manufacturers which may want to gain a market advantage over domestic auto manufacturers. We will seek to enter other markets as well, such as commercial trucking, as well as seek to have included in federal legislation a requirement that a alcohol sensing devices with ignition locking systems be retrofitted in all vehicles in the U.S.

&#160;

Regarding the use in monitoring employees and contractors in certain industries, such as surgeons, pilots and the military, we are in the process of soliciting potential customers interested in purchasing either interlocking or portable devices in various industries.

&#160;

Currently, we do not have the money or funding to achieve the above goals and based on our revenues, cash on hand and current monthly burn rate of approximately $25,000, we will need to continue borrowing from our shareholders and other related parties, and/or raise money from the sales of our securities, to fund operations.

Principal Products and Services 

&#160;

Our only product is SOBR. The SOBR device is a patented device for use in detecting alcohol in a person's system by measuring the ethanol content in their perspiration and determining whether that level is over or under a preset level set by the installer or a trained technician. SOBR works by having an individual touch a sensor for approximately six seconds, the sensor is specific to ethanol. It detects ethanol secreted through sweat that emanates from the hands. The product is produced in two basic forms. The first is an in-vehicle system that can be connected to an interlock system to prevent the operation of the vehicle in the event the sensor detects measurable ethanol content. The second product is a portable unit that can be used anywhere.

&#160;

The in-vehicle unit can be in any machine, including automobiles, buses, trucks, boats and aircraft. Once the driver touches the sensor for approximately six seconds, the SOBR device detects ethanol secreted through sweat that emanates from the hands. If the vehicle is fitted with an interlock device, then the ethanol level is instantly translated into an engine "start" or "no-start" signal. SOBR can also initiate random real-time tests while the vehicle is operating to ensure that the operator's ethanol level does not increase over the preset limit after the vehicle is started. If the system is tampered with while parked, the vehicle will not start. If the device is tampered with while driving, alarms will activate, such as the vehicle lights and horn, drawing attention to the vehicle. If a vehicle is equipped with a Global Positioning System, or Data Transmission Module, SOBR can alert fleet operators or others monitoring a vehicle of the detection of alcohol above preset levels.

&#160;

When SOBR is installed in a vehicle the system is virtually unnoticeable, unlike breathalyzer ignition interlock systems. SOBR requires approximately one hour to install in a vehicle. The control box can be mounted under the dash in the interior of the vehicle. In new vehicles the sensor can be installed as part of the steering wheel. In retrofits, the sensor is installed on the dashboard for easy access. We believe that our cost to manufacture a SOBR device will be approximately $100, and if the unit is installed in a vehicle the installation cost will be approximately $75. SOBR requires a semi-annual recalibration much like current smog devices. The recalibration is accomplished with a hand held device plugged into the control box and requires a trained technician approximately one hour to complete.

&#160;

We plan to license the installation and recalibration rights to the automotive service industry.

&#160;

The portable unit is similar in size and looks to a black, non-flip mobile telephone and can be temporarily attached to a solid fixture for more convenient usage. The portable unit can be used to test individuals before they are allowed to perform certain functions. As a portable unit the system will signal through the use of lights whether the tested individual is over a preset level. The company utilizing the device may then use the information how it sees fit.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

We have developed a marketing plan that our management believes will gain market recognition, as well as hopefully generate demand, for the SOBR device, primarily through trade shows, industry publications, general solicitation, social media, and public relations. We plan to sell the SOBR device through the use of selling groups, such as channel sales, distributors, and independent sales contractors. We believe the primary market for the in-vehicle SOBR device initially is the commercial vehicle market, such as trucking companies, taxi cab companies, limousine companies, and bus companies. Many of these companies have a significant financial interest in eliminating drunk drivers from their operations. Secondarily, individuals may desire to monitor a family member's vehicle, such as an automobile operated by a minor or a family member with a past alcohol issue.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe the primary market for the portable SOBR device is its use by companies and institutions that have an interest in monitoring their employees' or contractors' alcohol level due to their job responsibilities, such as surgeons prior to entering surgery, pilots prior to flying aircraft, mineworkers prior to entering a mine, or the military for personnel returning to a military base from off-base leave.

&#160;

As a result, we initially plan to market SOBR to the voluntary, commercial market:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

commercial transportation companies that operate tractor trailers, taxis, construction vehicles, boats, trains, aircraft and other vehicles;

&#160;

&#183; 

local, state and federal government agencies that operate fire trucks, police cars and public transportation systems; and

&#160;

&#183; 

individuals that desire to monitor a family member's vehicle, such as a vehicle operated by a minor.

&#160;

&#183; 

a variety of government and military employees, such as sailors in the Navy who might be tested before boarding a ship after off-base leave.

&#160;

We plan to establish a distribution system of individuals and companies including value-added resellers (VARS), channel sales teams, and independent contractors, to sell the products to the market.

&#160;

On July 10, 2014, we entered into a Master Distribution Agreement with A.G. Global Capital ("A.G. Global"), pursuant to which A.G. Capital will be the exclusive distributor of our SOBR alcohol testing device in the Republic of Turkey ("Turkey"), the Kingdom of Sweden ("Sweden") and the Gulf Cooperation Council ("GCC") comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Azerbaijan. &#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We manufactured the prototype SOBR devices we have to date (approximately 10 devices) in-house from over-the-counter components. The primary part is the sensor, which is an over-the-counter sensor, which we program in-house with our proprietary programming to have the sensor perform the necessary functions in the SOBR device. Currently, we use one specific sensor from one manufacturer but we believe that we would be able to use other sensor in the event this manufacturer stopped selling the sensor we currently use.

&#160;

Eventually, if we grow and need to mass manufacture the device, we are planning to manufacture of all components of the SOBR, as well as component assembly, through subcontracted to third parties and perform the final assembly, testing and calibration of the SOBR device at the company's California location. In order to assemble the SOBR device a manufacturer only needs the space, manpower, and common, non-exotic equipment.

&#160;

Our steps to the point of revenue generation, assuming we have sufficient funding, are as follows: (i) field and clinical testing of the SOBR device, which we estimate to complete in three months at a cost of $40,000; (ii) adjust the device based on the results of the tests, which we estimate to complete in two months at a cost of $60,000; (iii) manufacture, in-house, up to 1,000 units to have inventory on hand in the event of an order, which we estimate to complete in three months at a cost of $100,000; (iv) refine the device based on feedback, if necessary, which we estimate to complete in one month at a cost of $20,000; and (v) identify and contract with manufacturing facilities to build the device in quantity, when necessary, which we estimate to complete in four months at a cost of $15,000. Some of the above steps would run in parallel with other steps so we estimate the overall time to revenue generation would be less than 13 months listed above, likely closer to 8-9 months.

Competition 

&#160;

Currently, to our knowledge, breath analyzer ignition interlocks are the only products on the market which can detect alcohol and lock the ignition system of a vehicle. There are several limitations inherent with current design of breath analyzers that can be circumvented and are invasive in their appearance and use. At present, their market is substantially made up of the mandated market (the legal market as a punitive testing device). If breath analyzer sales occur outside the mandated market, to our knowledge, that represents a much smaller sales number as percentage of business.

&#160;

We believe SOBR has the following advantages over the majority of traditional breath analyzers:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Can be programmed to work during the entire operation of the vehicle without distracting the driver;

&#160;

&#183; 

The system can be considered as non-invasive comparatively

&#160;

&#183; 

Easy retro fit installation;

&#160;

&#183; 

Unobtrusive in the vehicle;

&#160;

&#183; 

Difficult to circumvent;

&#160;

&#183; 

Possible opportunity for the consumer to obtain insurance discounts that could offset some costs of the system. Although presently no insurance company is offering a premium discount, nor do we see that happening in the near future.

&#160;

To date the breath analyzer companies are predominantly focused on the mandated market and are not pursuing the commercial market with the same effort.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

As a portable unit the system will signal through the use of lights that the tested individual is over a preset level.

&#160;

When SOBR is installed in a vehicle the system is less noticeable than the most common breathalyzer ignition interlock systems. SOBR requires approximately one hour to install in a vehicle. The control box can be mounted under the dash in the interior of the vehicle. In new vehicles the sensor can be installed as part of the steering wheel as well as many other places in the vehicle that are convenient easily assessable to the driver. In retrofits, the sensor is installed on the dashboard for easy access. We believe that our cost to manufacture a SOBR device will be approximately $100, and if the unit is installed in a vehicle the installation cost will be approximately $75. SOBR requires a semi-annual recalibration much like current smog devices. The recalibration is accomplished with a hand held device plugged into the control box and requires a trained technician approximately one hour to complete.

&#160;

We plan to license the installation and recalibration rights to various retail and service businesses in the automotive service industry.

&#160;

SOBR is protected by the following three patents, filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

&#160;

1. Patent 6620108, which expires on December 26, 2021, pertains to the technology that identifies the vehicle's operator.

2. Patent 7173536, which expires on August 28, 2024, pertains to the substance detection and alarm system.

3. Patent 7377186, which expires on April 6, 2025, pertains to the interface system between the substance detection system and vehicle ignition system.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

At the present time, only the judicially-mandated market is regulated. Devices sold into this market must be approved by state government agencies. Since we plan to enter this market last, we will not, initially, be subject to government regulation. Although we realize we would be subject to regulation if and when we were to enter the mandated market.

&#160;

Regarding the use in vehicles, we believe SOBR offers a unique solution to the national drunk driving problem and have been and are continuing to perform beta testing of SOBR for this use. Our objective is to grow our sales and manufacturing of SOBR by aggressively pursuing the original equipment market ("OEM") once final beta testing is completed. We intend to seek an experienced OEM partner to introduce SOBR to the new automotive market. We believe that an increase in public awareness and consumer interest as well as potential cost savings will generate a demand for alcohol sensing technology. We hope that auto manufactures will begin installing SOBR as a factory installed option. If that happens we expect it would occur for some time in the future. We will also market SOBR to international car manufacturers which may want to gain a market advantage over domestic auto manufacturers. We will seek to enter other markets as well, such as commercial trucking, as well as seek to have included in federal legislation a requirement that alcohol sensing devices with ignition locking systems be retrofitted in all vehicles in the U.S. France is one country that has created laws that mandate vehicles to have an alcohol detection device on all private vehicles.

&#160;

Regarding the use in monitoring employees and contractors in certain industries, such as surgeons, pilots and the military, we are in the process of meeting with potential customers in certain identified business segments.

&#160;

Currently, we do not have the money or funding to achieve the above goals and we will not be able to achieve our goals unless we are successful in obtaining funding through this offering and potentially future offerings as well, all which may serve to dilute the ownership position of our current and future shareholders.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 30, 2016 we do not have any employees. Our sole officer is an independent contractor.
