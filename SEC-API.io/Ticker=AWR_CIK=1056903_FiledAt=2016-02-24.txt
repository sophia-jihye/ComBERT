General 

&#160; 

AWR is the parent company of GSWC and American States Utility Services, Inc. (&#8220;ASUS&#8221;) (and its subsidiaries (Fort Bliss Water Services Company (&#8220;FBWS&#8221;), Terrapin Utility Services, Inc. (&#8220;TUS&#8221;), Old Dominion Utility Services, Inc. (&#8220;ODUS&#8221;), Palmetto State Utility Services, Inc. (&#8220;PSUS&#8221;) and Old North Utility Services, Inc. (&#8220;ONUS&#8221;)). AWR was incorporated as a California corporation in 1998 as a holding company. AWR has three reportable segments: water, electric and contracted services. Within the segments, AWR has two principal business units, water and electric service utility operations, conducted through GSWC, and contracted services conducted through ASUS and its subsidiaries. FBWS, TUS, ODUS, PSUS and ONUS may be referred to herein individually as a &#8220;Military Utility Privatization Subsidiary&#8221; or collectively as the &#8220;Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries.&#8221; 

&#160; 

GSWC is a public utility engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of water in 10 counties in the State of California. GSWC is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (&#8220;CPUC&#8221;). It was incorporated as a California corporation on December 31, 1929. GSWC also distributes electricity in several San Bernardino County mountain communities in California through its Bear Valley Electric Service (&#8220;BVES&#8221;) division. 

&#160; 

GSWC served 260,151 water customers and 23,846 electric customers at December 31, 2015 , or a total of 283,997 customers, compared with 258,191 water customers and 23,716 electric customers at December 31, 2014 , or a total of 281,907 customers. GSWC&#8217;s operations exhibit seasonal trends. Although GSWC&#8217;s water utility operations have a diversified customer base, residential and commercial customers account for the majority of GSWC&#8217;s water sales and revenues. Revenues derived from commercial and residential water customers accounted for approximately 90% of total water revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

&#160; 

ASUS, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, has contracted with the U.S. government to provide water and/or wastewater services at various military installations. ASUS operates, maintains and performs construction activities (including renewal and replacement capital work) on water and/or wastewater systems at various United States military bases pursuant to 50-year firm, fixed-price contracts. Each of the contracts with the U.S. government is subject to termination, in whole or in part, prior to the end of its 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract. The contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination every three years following the initial two years of the contract or annually under an economic price adjustment. Contracts are also subject to equitable price adjustments and modifications for changes in circumstances, changes in laws and regulations, additions to the contract value for new construction of facilities at the military bases and changes in wages and fringe benefits to the extent provided in the contract. AWR guarantees performance of ASUS&#8217;s military privatization contracts. 

Pursuant to the terms of these contracts, the Military Utility Privatization Subsidiaries operate, as of the effective date of their respective contracts, the following water and wastewater systems: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

FBWS - water and wastewater systems at Fort Bliss located near El Paso, Texas and extending into southeastern New Mexico effective October 1, 2004; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

TUS - water and wastewater systems at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland effective February 1, 2006; 

&#8226; 

ODUS - wastewater system at Fort Lee in Virginia effective February 23, 2006 and the water and wastewater systems at Joint-Base Langley Eustis and Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story in Virginia (&#8220;TRADOC&#8221;) effective April 3, 2006; 

&#8226; 

PSUS - water and wastewater systems at Fort Jackson in South Carolina effective February 16, 2008; and 

&#8226; 

ONUS - water and wastewater systems at Fort Bragg, Pope Army Airfield and Camp Mackall, North Carolina effective March 1, 2008. 

&#160; 

Certain financial information for each of AWR&#8217;s business segments - water distribution, electric distribution, and contracted services - is set forth in Note 15 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of American States Water Company and its subsidiaries. AWR&#8217;s water and electric distribution segments are not dependent upon a single or only a few customers. The U.S. government is the primary customer for ASUS&#8217;s contracted services. ASUS, from time to time, performs work at military bases for other prime contractors of the U.S. government. 

&#160; 

The revenue from AWR&#8217;s segments is seasonal. The impact of seasonality on these AWR businesses is discussed in more detail in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Environmental matters and compliance with such laws and regulations are discussed in detail in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation&#8221; &#32;under the section titled &#8220;Environmental Matters.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The businesses of GSWC are substantially free from direct and indirect competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other public agencies within their existing service territories. However, GSWC may be subject to eminent domain proceedings in which governmental agencies, under state law, may acquire GSWC&#8217;s water systems if doing so is necessary and in the public&#8217;s interest. GSWC competes with governmental agencies and other investor-owned utilities in connection with offering service to new real estate developments on the basis of financial terms, availability of water and ability to commence providing service on a timely basis. ASUS actively competes for business with other investor-owned utilities, other third party providers of water and/or wastewater services and governmental entities primarily on the basis of price and quality of service. 

&#160; 

AWR Workforce 

&#160; 

AWR and its subsidiaries had a total of 707 employees as of January 31, 2016. GSWC had 553 employees as of January 31, 2016. Seventeen employees of BVES are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which expires in December 2017. Prior to March 2015, sixty-three employees at one of GSWC&#8217;s water rate-making areas were covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Utility Workers Union of America ("UWUA"), which expired by its own terms on August 31, 2014 and was thereafter extended on a monthly basis through February 28, 2015. In March 2015, GSWC received objective evidence that UWUA had lost support of a majority of the bargaining unit employees. Consequently, GSWC withdrew recognition of UWUA effective as of March 2, 2015. Thus, other than at BVES, GSWC has no other unionized employees. 

&#160; 

ASUS had 154 employees as of January 31, 2016. Sixteen of FBWS's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers. This agreement expires in 2017.
