 ITEM 1. Business 

&#160; 

QuantRx Biomedical Corporation was incorporated on December 5, 1986, in the State of Nevada. The Company&#8217;s principal business office is located at 10190 SW 90th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97123. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;ours,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; refer to QuantRx Corporation, a Nevada corporation. 

Overview 

&#160; 

We have developed and are working towards commercializing our patented miniform pads (&#8220; PADs &#8221;) and PAD based over-the-counter products for the treatment of hemorrhoids, minor vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, general catamenial uses and other medical needs. We are also developing and intend to commercialize genomic diagnostics for the laboratory market, based on our patented PadKit ( R ) technology. Our platforms include: inSync ( R ) , Unique ( TM ) , PadKit ( R ) , and OEM branded over-the-counter and laboratory testing products based on the Company&#8217;s core intellectual property related to its PAD technology. 

&#160; 

The continuation of our operations remain contingent on the receipt of additional financing required to execute our business and operating plan, which is currently focused on the commercialization of our PAD technology either directly or through a joint venture or other relationship intended to increase shareholder value. In the interim, we have nominal operations, focused principally on maintaining and expanding our intellectual property portfolio and maintaining compliance with the public company reporting requirements. We have continued to issue promissory notes to continue as a going concern. No assurances can be given that the Company will obtain financing, or otherwise successfully develop a business and operating plan or enter into an alternative relationship to commercialize the Company&#8217;s PAD technology. 

&#160; 

On June 20, 2012, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, QX Labs, Inc. (&#8220; QX &#8221;), and proceeded to transfer to QX all intellectual property and assets related to the Company&#8217;s diagnostic testing business (&#8220; Diagnostics Business &#8221;). The Diagnostic Business is based principally on the Company&#8217;s proprietary PadKit(R) technology, which the Company believes provides a patented platform technology for genomic diagnostics, including fetal genomics. Following the transfer of the Diagnostics Business to QX, the Company&#8217;s remaining business line consists of its over-the-counter business, including the InSync feminine hygienic interlabial pad, the Unique(R) Miniform for hemorrhoid application, and other treated miniforms (the &#8220; OTC Business &#8221;), as well as established and continuing licensing relationships related to the OTC Business. Management believes the creation of QX permits the Company to more efficiently explore different options to maximize the value of the Diagnostics Business and the OTC Business (collectively, the &#8220; Businesses &#8221;), with the objective of maximizing the value of the Businesses for the benefit of the Company and its stakeholders. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s current focus is to obtain additional working capital necessary to continue as a going concern, and develop a longer term financing and operating plan to: (i) leverage its broad-based intellectual property and patent portfolio to develop new and innovative diagnostic products; (ii) commercialize its OTC Business and its Diagnostics Business either directly or through joint ventures, mergers or similar transactions intended to capitalize on commercial opportunities presented by each of the Businesses; (iii) contract manufacturing to third parties while maintaining control over the manufacturing process; and (iv) maximize the value of the Company&#8217;s investments in non-core assets. As a result of its current financial condition, however, the Company&#8217;s efforts in the short-term will be focused on obtaining financing necessary to maintain the Company as a going concern.

Recent Developments 

Global Cancer Diagnostic, Inc. Letter of Intent 

On September 3, 2015, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the &#8220; Global LOI &#8221;) with Global Cancer Diagnostics, Inc., a privately held laboratory in Tempe, Arizona (&#8220; Global &#8221;), for a proposed business combination of the two entities. If executed, the Company will acquire 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Global in exchange for restricted shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (&#8220; Common Stock &#8221;), and will continue as the surviving entity, with Global becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Global LOI had an original termination date of October 31, 2015 (the &#8220; Termination Date &#8221;), but may be terminated or extended anytime by the mutual written consent of the parties. Management is currently in active discussions with Global regarding certain matters contained in the Global LOI, including an extension of the Termination Date. 

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Global LOI, the Company advanced to Global $50,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 (the &#8220; Global Advance &#8221;), which amount is currently due and payable by Global, on demand. In the event the Company and Global execute definitive merger documents, Global will issue to the Company that number of shares of Global&#8217;s common stock equal to 10% of the then outstanding shares of Global&#8217;s common stock, on a fully-diluted basis, as payment of the Global Advance. 

PadKit Studies 

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company initiated two separate international studies to develop the laboratory techniques needed to utilize the Company&#8217;s PadKit sampling technology for fetal cell and genome detection and analysis. The Company completed one of the studies initiated during 2014, and expects current and future studies to be an on-going effort, as it continues to expand and validate new disease targets and markets for its PadKit based diagnostic system. 

Bridge Financing 

&#160;

In July 2014, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors approved of a private offering of convertible promissory demand notes (the &#8220; Bridge Notes &#8221;) to certain accredited investors in the aggregate principal amount of up to $500,000. As additional consideration for the purchase of the Bridge Notes, the Board approved of the issuance of 200,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock to participating investors for every $100,000 invested. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company issued Bridge Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $121,500, and issued an aggregate total of 243,000 shares of its Common Stock. The Company also arranged for an extension of the maturity date of Bridge Notes from June 30, 2015 to December 31, 2015. As consideration for the extension of the maturity date of the Bridge Notes, the Company issued an aggregate total of 286,500 shares of Common Stock to the Bridge Note holders. 

Each Bridge Note accrues interest at a rate of 10% per annum, payable in either cash or shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock and matures on December 31, 2015. Each Bridge Note is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, into that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the outstanding principal balance of the Bridge Note, plus accrued but unpaid interest (the &#8220; Outstanding Balance &#8221;), divided by $0.08 (the &#8220; Conversion Shares &#8221;). Additionally, in the event the Company completes an equity or equity-linked financing with gross proceeds to the Company of at least $1.5 million (a &#8220; Qualified Financing &#8221;), the Outstanding Balance of all Bridge Notes will, at the discretion of each respective holder, either (i) convert into securities sold in the Qualified Financing, or (ii) automatically convert into Conversion Shares. 

&#160; 

The Company presently intends to issue additional promissory notes to finance its current working capital needs. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to issue additional promissory notes. 

Passing of Dr. William H. Fleming 

&#160; 

On March 21, 2015, Dr. William Fleming, the Company's Chief Scientific Officer and member of the Company's Board of Directors, unexpectedly passed away. The Board of Directors is currently searching for a successor to manage the Company as it executes its current business plan. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s objective is to develop the Company&#8217;s innovative PAD based products through genomic testing, although commercialization efforts are conditioned on securing adequate financing. Assuming the availability of adequate working capital, the Company&#8217;s objective is to target significant market opportunities for its products through the following platforms: 

&#160; 

PAD/Health and Wellness 

&#160; 

PAD products are based on the Company&#8217;s non-woven disposable absorbent pad technology, with products for aiding the treatment of hemorrhoids, minor vaginal infection, urinary incontinence, the over-the-counter catamenial markets, and other medical needs, including diagnostic sampling products which enable self-collection and worldwide transport for indications such as various cancers, premature delivery, and genomic testing. 

&#160; 

Diagnostic Products 

&#160; 

Diagnostic products historically constitute the core of the Company&#8217;s product development focus. The Company&#8217;s healthcare technologies are currently in different stages of development, ranging from commercialization to proof of concept. The Company ultimately plans to bring its products to commercialization; however, commercialization of these technologies is contingent on the development of a financing and operating plan that permits the Company to successfully capitalize on its development efforts to date. Such plan may include seeking a strategic or other partner to economically commercialize or finance the Company&#8217;s technologies. The Company&#8217;s objective in the interim is to maintain strict cost control measures, as well as maintain control of its technologies, in order to continue as a going concern. The discussion below assumes the Company continues with the development and commercialization of its technologies, although no assurances can be given. 

&#160; 

Product and Product Candidates 

&#160; 

The Company has historically operated under a two-fold product development strategy: (i) maximize the value of internally developed products that are market-ready for near-term distribution, and (ii) aggressively develop technology platforms for products the Company believes will address medical diagnostic and treatment issues into the future. 

&#160; 

When introducing its PAD product lines and other products, the Company sought to align itself with experienced marketing partners that have established distribution channels. The Company teamed with a manufacturing partner in Asia, as well as niche United States manufacturers, in order to bring products to market in an efficient manner while controlling product quality. While these relationships are currently in effect, each has been suspended pending the development of a financing and operating plan to commercialize the Company&#8217;s products and technology. 

&#160; 

PADs for Diagnosis and Treatment 

&#160; 

Our miniform PAD is a patented technology that provides the basis for a line of products that address an array of consumer health issues, including temporary relief of hemorrhoid and minor vaginal infection itch and discomfort, feminine urinary incontinence, catamenial needs, drug delivery, and medical sample collection and transport for diagnostic testing. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s PAD products for the consumer markets are FDA Class I over-the-counter devices, and are easy to use, non-invasive, fully biodegradable, highly absorbent pads. Additionally, the unique non-woven technology utilized for the PADs allows for a PAD to be used as a sample collection device, providing a sample for diagnostic purposes, or to provide local or systemic therapy. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

PADKit ( R ) 

&#160; 

The PADKit integrates the Company&#8217;s miniform technology with its diagnostic expertise. The PADKit contains a miniform used as a collection device to collect samples for diagnostic evaluation. Vaginally, the miniform collects blood along with numerous cells, vaginal mucous and discharge flushed out by the menstrual flow or during normal daily exfoliation. The PADKit is designed to provide the preferred sample collection system for use in population scale testing of indications such as HPV, HIV and general health screenings where healthcare professionals are not readily accessible. 

&#160; 

Although significant improvements have been made in the area of Pap test sample reading and sample preparation, clinical indications support broad testing for HPV that will have a greater impact in lowering the incidence of cervical cancer. The Company believes the PADKit will provide a superior and more consistent sample, as well as a simpler, more comfortable and convenient procedure for HPV testing. The Company further hopes to demonstrate viability of the PADKit as the basis of various other diagnostic and screening tests. 

&#160; 

The Company holds several patents for the method and apparatus for collecting vaginal fluid and exfoliated vaginal cells for diagnostic purposes, collection of a sample for general diagnostic screening, and the collection of an anal sample for prostate and other diagnostic purposes. Several clinical studies have been conducted with and on the PADKit, which have provided data needed to show the degree to which the sample collected can be used to replace other accepted samples, ability to provide a genomic testing sample as well as its safety and ease of use. 

&#160; 

Unique ( R ) Miniforms 

&#160; 

Miniform is a safe, convenient, and flushable technology for the underserved over-the-counter hemorrhoid, feminine hygiene and urinary incontinence markets. The disposable miniform pads contain no adhesives, requires no insertion, and are small enough to fit in the palm of a hand. 

&#160; 

The Unique ( R ) miniform is available as a treated pad for the temporary relief of the itch and discomfort associated with hemorrhoids and minor vaginal infection, and as an untreated pad, for the daily protection of light urinary, vaginal or anal leakage. 

&#160; 

While the Company initiated a limited web-based domestic roll-out of the Unique ( R ) miniform, it is in search of a strategic partnership(s) to expand the retail availability of the product across the United States and internationally. 

&#160; 

The Company has significant experience manufacturing its miniform and a clear understanding of its costs. The miniform technology is protected by numerous patents covering various applications, the manufacturing process, and certain materials. The Company previously contracted with a firm based in Taiwan to manufacture its pads, although the manufacturing relationship is currently suspended due to the Company&#8217;s financial condition, and pending the development of a financing and operation plan that allows the Company to recommence active operations. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and significant technological changes. Significant competitive factors in our industry include, among others, product efficacy and safety, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the government reimbursement rates for and the average selling price of products, the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity, manufacturing costs, intellectual property and patent rights and their protection, and sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. 

&#160; 

We face, and will continue to face, competition from organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Any product candidates that we successfully develop, which are cleared for sale by the FDA or similar international regulatory authorities in other countries, may compete with similar products currently available or that may become available in the future. Most of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources than we have, and greater capabilities and resources for research, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, marketing and sales. As a result, we may face competitive disadvantages relative to these organizations should they develop or commercialize a competitive product. In addition, given our current lack of working capital, our competitors will have the opportunity to capture market opportunities missed by the Company as we attempts to secure additional financing necessary to commercialize our products. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Manufacturing 

&#160; 

The Company currently does not have manufacturing capacity for any of its products and therefore has historically contracted for the manufacturing of its products to third-party manufacturers, both in and outside the United States. All manufactured products are produced under FDA mandated Good Manufacturing Practices standard operating procedures developed and controlled by the Company&#8217;s quality system, which specifies approved raw materials, vendors, and manufacturing methodology. During the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the Company&#8217;s operations were inspected by the FDA and found to be in full compliance. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Rights and Patents 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had thirteen (13) patents issued, seven (7) patents pending, one (1) allowed patent, and two (2) licensed patents. Our issued patents expire between 2018 and 2030; however, the Company may obtain continuations, which would extend the rights granted under our issued patents, and additional patents to cover technology in development. The Company also holds six (6) registered U.S. and foreign trademarks and has one (1) pending trademark. 

&#160; 

Patents and other proprietary rights are an integral part of our business. It is our policy to seek patent protection for our inventions and also to rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. &#160; However, our patent positions involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our issued patents, those licensed to us, and those that may be issued to us in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted thereunder may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be approved for sale and commercialized, our relevant patent rights may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization. Expiration of patents we own or license could adversely affect our ability to protect future product development and, consequently, our operating results and financial position. 

&#160; 

Licensing, Distribution and Development Agreements 

&#160; 

On August 14, 2008, the Company entered into a ten-year Technology License Agreement with Church &#38; Dwight Co., Inc. (&#8220; Church &#38; Dwight &#8221;). Under the terms of the Agreement, Church &#38; Dwight acquired exclusive world-wide rights to use certain Company technology related to a jointly developed at-home diagnostic test and began distributing the product in early 2009, resulting in the Company receiving royalties on net sales of the product in 2015 and 2014 of $156 and $1,027 respectively. 

&#160; 

The Company licenses patent rights and know-how for certain hemorrhoid treatment pads and related coatings from The Procter &#38; Gamble Company. The five-year license agreement was entered into July 2006 and has a five-year automatic renewal option. Although the Company renewed the agreement in 2011, payments have been suspended due to the Company&#8217;s current financial condition. The Company has subsequently filed for a patent to address the technology used in its treated miniforms, which patent was issued during 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

Some of our products and manufacturing activities are, or will be subject to regulation by the FDA, and by other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. Pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, commonly known as the FD&#38;C Act, and the regulations promulgated under it, the FDA regulates the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, promotion, advertising and sampling of medical devices and medical imaging products. Before a new device or pharmaceutical product can be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must generally obtain marketing clearance through a section 510(k) notification, through a Premarket Approval (&#8220; PMA &#8221;), or New Drug Approval (&#8220; NDA &#8221;). 

&#160; 

In the United States, medical devices intended for human use are classified into three categories, Class I, II or III, on the basis of the controls deemed reasonably necessary by the FDA to assure their safety and effectiveness with Class I requiring the fewest controls and Class III the most controls. Class I, unless exempted, and Class II devices are marketed following FDA clearance of a Section 510(k) premarket notification. Since Class III devices (e.g., a device whose failure could cause significant human harm or death) tend to carry the greatest risks, the manufacturer must demonstrate that such a device is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting a PMA application. PMA approval by the FDA is required before a Class III device can be lawfully marketed in the United States. Usually, the PMA process is significantly more time consuming and costly than the 510(k) process. 

&#160; 

The U.S. regulatory scheme for the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, which includes the targeted molecular imaging agents, can be divided into three distinct phases: an investigational phase including both preclinical and clinical investigations leading up to the submission of an NDA; a period of FDA review culminating in the approval or refusal to approve the NDA; and the post-marketing period. 

&#160; 

All of our over-the-counter products derived from the miniform technology, including Unique(R), are currently classified as Class I &#8211; exempt devices, requiring written notification to the FDA before marketing. 

&#160; 

In addition, the FD&#38;C Act requires device manufacturers to obtain a new FDA 510(k) clearance when there is a substantial change or modification in the intended use of a legally marketed device, or a change or modification, including product enhancements, changes to packaging or advertising text and, in some cases, manufacturing changes, to a legally marketed device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness. Supplements for approved PMA devices are required for device changes, including some manufacturing changes that affect safety or effectiveness, or disclosure to the consumer, such as labeling. For devices marketed pursuant to 510(k) determinations of substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must obtain FDA clearance of a new 510(k) notification prior to marketing the modified device. For devices marketed with PMA, the manufacturer must obtain FDA approval of a supplement to the PMA prior to marketing the modified device. Such regulatory requirements may require the Company to retain records for up to seven years, and be subject to periodic regulatory review and inspection of all facilities and documents by the FDA. 

&#160; 

The FD&#38;C Act requires device manufacturers to comply with Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. The regulations require that medical device manufacturers comply with various quality control requirements pertaining to design controls, purchasing contracts, organization and personnel, including device and manufacturing process design, buildings, environmental control, cleaning and sanitation; equipment and calibration of equipment; medical device components; manufacturing specifications and processes; reprocessing of devices; labeling and packaging; in-process and finished device inspection and acceptance; device failure investigations; and record keeping requirements including complaint files and device tracking. Company personnel and non-affiliated contract auditors periodically inspect the contract manufacturers to assure they remain in compliance. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s operations are currently in compliance with current FDA requirements. In the quarter ended June 30, 2012, the FDA audited the Company, and its operations were found to be fully compliant. 

&#160; &#160; 

Additionally, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220; CMS &#8221;) regulates all laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the U.S. through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (&#8220; CLIA &#8221;). In total, CLIA covers approximately 225,000 laboratory entities. The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Office of Clinical Standards and Quality (&#8220; OCSQ &#8221;) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA Program. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The objective of the CLIA program is to ensure quality laboratory testing. Although all clinical laboratories must be properly certified to receive Medicare or Medicaid payments, CLIA has no direct Medicare or Medicaid program responsibilities. In the event the Company&#8217;s current operating plan includes such a facility, it will fall under CLIA regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

Certain of our product candidates will require significant clinical validation prior to obtaining marketing clearance from the FDA. The Company intends to contract with appropriate and experienced CROs (contract research organizations) to prepare for and review the results from clinical field trials. The Company engages certain scientific advisors, consisting of scientific Ph.D.s and M.D.&#8217;s, who contribute to the scientific and medical validity of its clinical trials when appropriate. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Activities 

&#160; 

The Company spent $13,154 and $65,735 on research and development activities during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in research and development fees in 2015 is directly attributable to lower costs associated with clinical trial expense in the 2015 period. 

The Company anticipates that its research and development activities will continue to increase as the Company seeks to expand and validate new disease targets and markets for its PadKit based diagnostic system. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had no employees; however, the Company has four part-time consultants providing services to the Company in order to maintain the Company as a going concern and to protect the Company&#8217;s intellectual property portfolio and other assets.
