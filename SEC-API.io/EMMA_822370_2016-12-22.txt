ITEM 1. The Business 

&#160;

MYnd Analytics, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is a predictive analytics company that has developed a decision support tool to help physicians reduce trial and error treatment in mental health and provide more personalized care to patients. The Company provides objective clinical decision support to mental healthcare providers for the personalized treatment of behavioral disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (&#8220;PTSD&#8221;) and other non-psychotic disorders. The Company uses its proprietary neurometric platform, PEER Online, to generate Psychiatric EEG Evaluation Registry (&#8220;PEER&#8221;) Reports to predict the likelihood of response by an individual to a range of medications prescribed for the treatment of behavioral disorders.

&#160;

The Market for Predictive Medicine 

&#160; 

Analysts have identified predictive medicine as one of the fastest-growing markets in healthcare, particularly, healthcare startups using advanced machine learning algorithms for medical imaging &#38; diagnostics, remote patient monitoring, and risk prediction. The global healthcare analytics market is expected to reach USD 42.8 billion by 2024, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Efforts to reduce the spiraling healthcare costs are facilitating the usage of healthcare analytics. Additionally, the benefits of HA include the improvement of patient access to customized care, the furthering of transparent operations to enable better public oversight, and innovation in patient care delivery and services. Practical examples include Google&#8217;s $1 billion Baseline project to collect outcome data on 10,000 employees over the next 5 years, IBM Watson&#8217;s brain initiative, and Myriad Genetics&#8217; recent acquisition of Assurex Health.

&#160;

With the recent publication of its military results, and 42 independent, confirming studies reported in Biological Psychiatry in September, the Company now intends to move its focus to commercialization and growth.

&#160; 

The Challenge and the Opportunity 

&#160;

Psychotropic medications have become the dominant treatment for mild to severe behavioral disorders with greater than 400% growth in the prescription of antidepressant medications over the last two decades. However, recent research has emerged challenging the assumption of efficacy of psychotropic medications for the treatment of mild to severe behavioral disorders, finding that these medications often do not work or lose their efficacy over time. There are over 17 million Americans who are considered to be &#34;treatment-resistant,&#34; having failed two or more courses of psychotropic medication treatment for their behavioral disorder. For these treatment-resistant patients, the conventional &#34;trial and error&#34; method of prescribing psychotropic medications has resulted in low efficacy, multiple side-effects and high relapse rates leading to treatment discontinuation, prolonged patient suffering and billions of dollars in additional healthcare costs to payers.

&#160;

Currently, due to the lack of objective neurophysiological data available to physicians of brain function, physicians regularly make prescribing decisions based on incomplete symptomatic factors. Consequently, the underlying pathology and physiology of behavioral disorders are often not analyzed effectively by treating physicians and treatment for the patient is often ineffective, costly and may require multiple different courses of treatment before an effective medication is identified, if at all. To address this unmet medical need, we offer our PEER Online technology to analyze an individual's digital Quantitative EEG (&#8220;QEEG&#8221;), correlating the individual&#8217;s QEEG features with medication outcomes in our proprietary database of over 10,000 unique patients to predict the efficacy of psychotropic medications by class and individual medication. The output of this analysis &#8212; the PEER Report &#8212; has been used as adjunctive information by physicians for over a decade on approximately 12,000 patients suffering from behavioral disorders including depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (&#34;OCD&#34;), bipolar disorder, PTSD, addiction and eating disorders, including anorexia.

&#160;

The reliability of QEEG data as a predictor of medication outcomes has been well established in over 100 published studies involving more than 6,000 patients. Addressing the unmet clinical need for effective prescribing is crucial in overcoming the low efficacy, side-effects and high relapse rates of the current trial and error method of prescribing which we believe leads to treatment discontinuation, prolonged patient suffering and billions of dollars of additional healthcare costs to payers for patients with behavioral disorders.

&#160;

Competitive Advantages of MYnd Technology 

&#160; 

MYnd technologies utilizes what is believed to be the largest database of longitudinal patient outcomes, collected from our subscribing physicians and patients over more than a decade. Because our data &#34;learns&#34;, we are uniquely positioned to build the gold standard for personalizing treatment in mental health. PEER offers practical advantages to physicians and patients, including:

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Higher Efficacy &#8212; Findings presented at the Military Health Services Research Symposium in August, 2016 included pooled results from all four randomized trials of PEER, with an average 47% improvement (mean change from baseline) for PEER-guided treatments, compared to only 16% average improvement in the standard of care group. In other words, physicians with PEER information had three times higher medication efficacy than physicians treating as usual without the benefit of PEER. &#183; Clinical utility &#8212; PEER results are available same-day and provide objective, actionable data to support treating physicians. A retrospective study by Medco found that 92% of physicians changed pharmacotherapy based on information provided by PEER. &#183; Machine learning &#8212; A core attribute of the PEER Registry approach is that it &#8220;learns&#8221;, using machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of recommendations as outcomes are added to the database. In the last three years, an additional 1,500 patients were added to the PEER Registry, improving overall predictive accuracy from 86% to 91%. &#183; Pharmacogenomics &#8212; Currently, we believe that the most proven targets for pharmacogenomics are in the liver &#8212; i.e. CYP450 drug metabolism &#8212; which apply to less than 15% of Americans. Conversely, PEER is based on functional brain activity and therefore, is more broadly applicable. Accordingly, we executed testing agreements this year with two national laboratories to include pharmacogenomic testing in our approved SMART-MD protocol. Outcome data from genomic testing may further improve the accuracy of PEER &#8212; specifically, we expect data from the SMART-MD trial to pinpoint the contribution of each modality to predictive accuracy, and we will continue to look for strategic relationships with genomic partners. &#160;

Latest Clinical Results 

&#160; 

The trial we commenced at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (&#34;Walter Reed&#34;) and Fort Belvoir Community Hospital (&#34;Fort Belvoir&#34;) (collectively, the &#34;Walter Reed PEER Trial&#34;) is the fourth randomized, controlled trial of PEER technology, and was designed to be one of the largest psychiatric treatment trials in recent history, with 1,922 subjects originally contemplated for enrollment. The protocol was designed as a randomized, double-blind, multi-site controlled clinical trial for military patients with a primary diagnosis of depression, and allowed for comorbid diagnoses such as PTSD, mTBI and other behavioral disorders. Reflecting the military&#8217;s need for a generalizable, real-world evidence trial, we consequently included patients with active suicidal ideation, although in most drug trials these suicidal ideation patients would have been specifically excluded. The protocol was designed to produce reportable results at several points during the study, with interim results to be assessed when the study reached 10%, 25%, and 50% of targeted enrollment. However, in May 2014, following enrollment of 150 evaluable patients in the trial and the interim analysis and submission of the initial results of those patients, the Walter Reed Institutional Review Board (the &#34;Walter Reed IRB&#34;) suspended enrollment of new patients in order to conduct an internal review. We do not expect to recommence the Walter Reed PEER Trial.

&#160;

Statistically significant results were obtained sooner than expected, at 150 patients, and interim results were prepared at the request of Congress in April, 2014. Ten of the study&#8217;s twelve endpoints had been achieved at this early stage in the study, leaving the possibility that the entire study may be completed with little more than 50 additional subjects.

&#160;

The most important clinical finding of the interim results based on the first 10% of trial enrollment of the Walter Reed PEER Trial, was a 75% greater reduction in suicidality when military physicians followed PEER recommendations. No other military studies have achieved this level of improvement simply by improved targeting of current therapies. By comparison, a 1% increase in suicidality among children and young adults was sufficient to cause the addition of black box warning labels by the FDA for all antidepressants. Finally, treatments which followed PEER recommendations resulted in 2.5 times greater adherence to therapy, with a median of 5 follow-up visits for subjects on PEER-recommended therapies compared with 2 visits for those on non-PEER treatments.

&#160;

The findings of the Walter Reed PEER Trial were disruptive, as the study data has been validated and revalidated by internal and external groups and has not changed in two years. The military reported to Congress that &#8220;no quality or safety issues&#8221; had been present in the course of the study, and in 2016, the FDA completed a full on-site inspection of study data and procedures revealing &#8220;no significant concerns&#8221;.

&#160;

We expect additional publications around our study results and were included in a major Biological Psychiatry review article published in September, which summarized our clinical trials and 42 independent, controlled clinical trials which confirmed the utility of EEG in guiding pharmacologic interventions in mental health.

&#160;

Current Research 

&#160;

Just as we have validated our data from the Walter Reed PEER Trial, we have also committed to rapidly replicate our findings and grow our database asset: 

&#183; Canadian Armed Forces this year began their own clinical trial (n = 150) with a substantially similar protocol to that used in the Walter Reed PEER Trial. Additional NATO partners may join the clinical trial in 2017. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; The SMART-MD trial was IRB approved and is expected to include 468 people. Plans are underway to begin enrollment in Southern California and North Carolina. This will be the first prospective trial to study the individual contributions of pharmacogenomics and quantitative EEG (&#8220;QEEG&#8221;), as well as providing useful data for updating of PEER classifiers. &#183; The beta version of the MYnd Mobile App has launched, making outcome data collection easier and more granular for patients whose doctors use PEER. &#160;

Commercial Strategy 

&#160;

We plan to drive adoption of our technology and secure sustained profitability through the following four-pronged plan:

&#160;

1. Military and veterans. Due to the high visibility of their problem, military and veterans possess the ability to sustain demand and need for intervention. Dr. David J. Shulkin, the Veterans Administration Undersecretary for Health stated in July 2016, that &#8220;one veteran suicide is one too many, and this collaborative effort provides both upside and comprehensive data that allows us to make better informed decisions on how to prevent this national tragedy.&#8221; &#160;

2. Commercial growth strategy outside of the US. The Canadian Armed Forces trial has commenced, which will provide both NATO and Health Canada (single payer system) experience with our PEER technology. It will also increase the size of our data base, and potentially result in PEER being adopted as a standard of care by Health Canada. &#160;

3. Payer and Health System Pilots. Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#34;CMS&#34;), part of the Department of Health and Human Services (&#34;HHS&#34;), which administers programs including Medicare and Medicaid, is moving 50% of reimbursement to become value-based by 2018. With this trend, and growing enforcement of Mental Health Parity, the payer market has changed in ways which favor our product. Management&#8217;s goal is to implement payer pilot programs which demonstrate the clinical and economic efficacy of using PEER to get patients on appropriate mental health medications, thereby lowering utilization of health care costs and improving outcomes. Technology assessment/coverage submissions are underway with all multiple commercial health plans and managed care organizations. The first MYnd Center received CMS certification as an Independent Diagnostic Testing Facility (IDTF) in September 2016, and management intends to proceed with a submission to CMS for a national coverage determination. No assurance can be given as to whether or when such a determination will be granted. &#160;

4. Provider group marketing. We&#8217;ve seen significant growth in formation of outpatient psychiatric groups, which concentrate both risk and purchasing power. We are actively pursuing group purchasing agreements with a number of outpatient, multi-center and multi-physician groups. &#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

PEER Online Patent 

&#160;

We have 22 issued patents, of which nine are in the U.S., which cover the process involved in our PEER Online service. Our patents will expire between September 2017 and July 2022. In addition, we believe these patents cover the analytical methodology we use with any form of neurophysiology measurement including SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography), fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), PET (Positron Emission Tomography), CAT (Computerized Axial Tomography), and MEG (Magnetoencephalography). We do not currently have data on the use of such alternate measurements, but we believe they may, in the future, prove to be useful to guide therapy in a manner similar to referenced-EEG. We have been issued patents in the following countries and regions: Canada (three patents), Europe (two patents), Australia (three patents), Mexico (two patents), Japan (two patents) and Israel (one patent). We also have filed multiple additional patent applications for our technology in the U.S., Europe and Canada.

&#160;

One US patent approval was for a distinctly new patent estate, covering internet transmission of neurometric information. This new allowance under its basic methods patent portfolio, patent number 8,239,013, covers remote or web-based transmission of neurometric data. In the event that use of neurometric data or algorithms becomes widespread, this patent could make it necessary for major equipment manufacturers to license rights from the Company in order to transmit such information for use in medication response prediction.

&#160;

During 2009 and 2011, we were awarded additional process patents for use of PEER Online technology in drug discovery, including clinical trial and drug efficacy studies. In addition, we successfully defended our patents by requesting reexamination of a patent issued to Aspect Medical (acquired by Covidien, plc.), resulting in a reduction and narrowing of claims awarded under the previously issued Aspect Medical patents.

&#160;

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation 

&#160;

MYnd has filed patent applications in the U.S. and Canada related to the Company's acquisition of patient responsivity data for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (&#8220;TMS&#8221;). This would be the Company's first application for a neurometric predictor of a non-drug therapy. The Company anticipates using this methodology to help physicians better understand which patients may positively respond to TMS for treating depression. The U.S. and Canadian patent applications are entitled &#8220;Method for Assessing the Susceptibility of a Human Individual Suffering from a Psychiatric or Neurological Disorder to Neuromodulation Treatment.&#8221;

&#160;

TMS is a non-invasive outpatient procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate areas of the brain thought to control mood. TMS, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and offered by approximately 300 psychiatrists nationwide, is sometimes used as an alternative treatment for patients who have failed one or more antidepressants for the treatment of depression. While treatment periods vary by patient, a typical treatment regimen generally involves 20 to 30 treatments over a four to six week period.

&#160;

TMS responsivity data, which is based on QEEG, helps physicians learn how patients with similar EEG patterns responded to TMS, thereby enabling them to more effectively guide patients most likely to benefit from this treatment and reduce expenditures on patients for whom TMS is not likely to be an effective solution for their depression.

&#160;

TMS Response Study: In February 2012, results from a study of EEG prediction of TMS responsivity were published by Dr. Martijn Arns in the peer-reviewed journal Brain Stimulation. &#8220;Neurophysiological predictors of non-response to rTMS in depression&#8221; presents results of a multi-site clinical trial (n=90) in the Netherlands using several MYnd variables (iAPF, Theta and P300 amplitude) associated with non-response to TMS therapy. Use of these combined neurometrics in a discriminant analysis resulted in a reliable identification of non-responders with low false positive rates. Replication studies are currently being planned in both the Netherlands and the United States.

&#160;

Trademarks 

&#160;

&#8220;Referenced-EEG&#8221;, &#8220;rEEG&#8221;, PEER Online and our MYnd Analytics logo are registered trademarks of the Company in the United States. We will continue to expand our brand names and our proprietary trademarks worldwide as our operations expand. 

PEER Online Database 

&#160;

The PEER Online database consists of over 38,000 clinical outcomes for over 10,200 unique patients with psychiatric or addictive problems. The PEER Online database is maintained in two parts:

&#160;

1. The QEEG Database

&#160;

The QEEG Database includes EEG recordings and neurometric data derived from analysis of these recordings. QEEG is a standard measure that adds cloud-based computerized statistical analyses to traditional EEG studies. We have used two separate QEEG databases from different vendors, wh ich provide statistical and normative information in the generation of a PEER Report.

&#160;

2. The PEER Outcomes Database

&#160;

The PEER Outcomes Database consists of physician-provided assessments of the clinical long-term outcomes of patients and their associated medications. The clinical outcomes of patients are recorded using an industry-standard outcome rating scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (&#8220;CGI-I&#8221;). The CGI-I allows a clinician to rate how much the patient&#8217;s illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state. A patient&#8217;s illness is compared to change over time and rated as: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse. The format of the data is standardized and that standard is enforced at the time of capture by a software application. Outcome data is input into the database by the treating physician or their office staff. Each physician has access to their patient data through the software tool that captures the clinical outcome data.

&#160;

We consider the information contained in the PEER Online database to be a valuable trade secret and are diligent about protecting such information. The PEER Online database is stored on a secure server to which only a limited number of employees have access.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Although we are not aware of any company that offers a service directly comparable to PEER Online services, the following companies might be noted as pursuing similar strategies:

&#160;

BRAIN RESOURCE COMPANY is an Australian Clinical Research Organization (CRO) and neurosciences company focused on personalized medicine solutions for patients, clinicians, pharmaceutical trials and discovery research. Its iSpot clinical trial, and list of genomic and neurocognitive tools, some of which include QEEG, appears to focus on the same growing market that is targeted by us.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

ASSURERx, GENOMIND, and HARMONYX are representative of CLIA lab companies focused on a genomic lab-based test for medication response, based primarily on their individual metabolism of medications. All have achieved varying levels of reimbursement for their tests from insurers. We consider such tests to be related and complementary. AssureRx was recently acquired by Myriad Genetics (MYGN).

&#160;

VERILY , a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (a division formerly known as Google Life Sciences) is currently pursuing a $1 billion, 5-year Baseline Project to develop biometric and pharmacogenomic biomarkers using machine learning.

&#160;

IBM CORPORATION entered the field of clinical decision support with the launch of its Watson product, a natural language artificial intelligence system. According to IBM, the supercomputer-based software can scan information in 1 million books or about 200 million pages of data, analyze it and respond with answers in less than three seconds. Watson will sort through large amounts of electronic health records and unstructured medical data providing recommendations to doctors and nurses on treatment plans.

&#160;

MICROSOFT CORPORATION and GENERAL ELECTRIC have combined their respective health information technology product lines into a new, jointly-owned population health management company called Caradigm. The venture is purported to bring Microsoft&#8217;s deep expertise in building platforms and ecosystems, and GE Healthcare&#8217;s experience in clinical and administrative workflows.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

In 2008, the FDA informed us that it believes our rEEG service, and its successor, now called PEER Online, constitutes a medical device which is subject to regulation by the FDA, requiring pre-market approval or 510(k) clearance by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) before our service can be marketed or sold.

&#160;

In early 2010, based upon written guidance from the FDA&#8217;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (&#8220;Center&#8221;), we submitted an application to obtain 510(k) clearance for our rEEG service, without waiving our right to continue to take the position that our services do not constitute a medical device. We sought review of our rEEG service, based upon its equivalence to predicate devices that already have FDA clearance, which appeared to represent a sound mechanism in order to reduce regulatory risks.

&#160;

On July 27, 2010, we received a letter (the &#8220;NSE Letter&#8221;) from the FDA stating that they determined that our rEEG service was Not Substantially Equivalent (&#8220;NSE&#8221;) to the predicate devices that had previously been granted 510(k) clearance and that among other options we could be required to file a premarket approval application (PMA) and obtain approval before our rEEG service can be marketed legally, unless it is otherwise reclassified. The Company has filed an appeal for reconsideration of this finding based on material product modifications and additional evidence. For example, the Company received in June 2011, a response to its outstanding Freedom of Information Act request for original copies of the predicate filings, which the Company believes confirms its position that the predicate devices were cleared for the same intended use as the rEEG service.

&#160;

In December 2010, and again in September 2011, the Company met with Center officials to determine whether the FDA had or would soon be developing a regulatory pathway for clinical decision support services such as PEER. In the latter meeting, the Company provided a detailed outline of its PEER Outcome registry, a published, transparent repository of individual medication response reports which reference known electrophysiology variables. Application of these published data can be performed manually, much like tables in medical journals, and do not meet the traditional definition of a regulated medical device.

&#160;

Following its September, 2011, meeting with Center officials, the Company successfully registered its PEER Outcome database as a Class I Exempt Device within the category of Medical Device Data System, Section 860.6310. The Company completed registration in California of its Class I MDDS, and as part of the approval process, hosted an on-site audit of its quality management systems and software validation processes. The State of California Department of Public Health, Food and Drug Branch, Device Manufacturing License was issued and received by the Company on December 23, 2013.

&#160;

At the same time, the Company continued its engagement with Center staff over the potential for a regulatory pathway for PEER Online as a Class II medical device, based on the Center&#8217;s recommendation that military use of PEER Online move forward under an Investigational Device Exemption (&#8220;IDE&#8221;) in order to provide additional data to support a successful 510(k) filing. The Company submitted a protocol in November, 2011 for a multi-site clinical trial led by Walter Reed, to include several other sites, partnering with military physicians treating 2,000 patients diagnosed with mental health conditions such as depression, PTSD, mTBI and several other disorders.

&#160;

In August 2012, the FDA issued a determination that the Walter Reed PEER Trial was considered a Non-Significant Risk (&#8220;NSR&#8221;) clinical trial and did not require an IDE application.

&#160;

On November 30, 2012, Walter Reed&#8217;s Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) approved the protocol for research to be conducted at Walter Reed and Fort Belvoir. Walter Reed acted as the lead site and provided the Principal Investigator. On January 23, 2013, the Company received a memorandum from the Commander of Walter Reed, which officially confirmed the approval of the protocol and permission to conduct the clinical trial. The project title of the clinical trial is &#8220;Use of PEER Interactive to inform the prescription of psychotropic medications to patients with behavioral disorders.&#8221; Subsequently, the same protocol was also approved by the IRB at Fort Belvoir.

The Walter Reed PEER Trial was designed to generate real-world, generalizable evidence with an anticipated significant statistical sample of almost 2,000 subjects using our PEER Interactive technology. The protocol was designed as a randomized, double-blind, multi-site controlled clinical trial for military patients with a primary diagnosis of depression, and allowed for comorbid diagnoses such as PTSD, mTBI and other behavioral disorders. The protocol was designed to produce reportable results at several points during the study, with interim results to be assessed when the study reached 10%, 25%, and 50% of targeted enrollment. A post-hoc analysis was performed to evaluate the predictiveness of the database for the entire evaluable patient population, including the control subjects (i.e. did the physicians, in both the experimental and control groups, whose prescriptions matched medications rated highly in the PEER Reports do better than physicians whose prescriptions did not match up with the medications rated highly by the reports). 

&#160;

In April 2014, based on an interim analysis of less than 10% of the planned clinical trial enrollees, statistically significant results were achieved for ten of the twelve endpoints of the Walter Reed PEER Trial. In May 2014, following the interim analysis, the Walter Reed IRB suspended enrollment of new patients into the study in order to conduct an internal review. In December 2014, the review was completed and the protocol, with minor amendments, was resubmitted by the interim Principal Investigator to the Walter Reed IRB for approval. The leadership had expressed interest in continuing the trial and, if clinical utility is demonstrated, the significant potential impact that the PEER Interactive technology could have in the treatment of depression. The leadership had also expressed its desire to devote time and attention to the trial to make it a successful endeavor. The Company does not intend to recommence the trial at Walter Reed.

&#160;

In February 2016, the Company hosted a five day on-site FDA inspection at its headquarters in California. The inspection focused solely on procedures, processes, communications and data associated with the Walter Reed PEER Trial. Subsequently, we received a letter, dated June 9, 2016, the purpose of which was to inform the Company that the FDA inspection conducted at the Company from February 3, 2016, to February 11, 2016, revealed no significant concerns and as a result, no response to the FDA letter was necessary. 

&#160;

The Company further validated data collected in the Walter Reed PEER Trial by performing source document verification, post-hoc sample tests and cross validation exercises. For example, new outcomes for approximately 1,500 unique patients &#8211; or ten times the number reported in the Walter Reed PEER Trial interim results &#8212; have been added to the PEER Registry since the inception of our work with Walter Reed, and these outcomes were consistent with our findings in the Walter Reed PEER Trial interim report.

&#160;

Following the FDA&#8217;s inspection and further validation of its data, the Company published its results of the PEER Trial in the Journal of Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment on August 25, 2016.

&#160;

We currently intend to continue marketing as a cloud-based neurometric information service branded as PEER Online, under our Class I registration, while we continue to pursue the military trial and consider submission of a Class II device premarket application. If we continue to market PEER Online and the FDA determines that we should be subject to further FDA regulation, it could seek enforcement action against us based upon its position that our PEER Online product represents a Class II medical device, as a result of which we could be forced to cease our marketing activities and pay fines and penalties, which would have a material adverse impact on us.

&#160;

In addition to the foregoing, federal and state laws and regulations relating to the sale of our neurometric services are subject to future changes, as are administrative interpretations of regulatory agencies. In the event that federal and state laws and regulations change, we may need to incur additional costs to seek government approvals for the sale of our neurometric services. 

In the future, we may seek approval for medications or combinations of medications for new indications, either with corporate partners, or potentially, on our own. The development and commercialization of medications for new indications is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Federal government, principally through the FDA and other federal, state and governmental authorities elsewhere. Prior to marketing any central nervous system medication, and in many cases prior to being able to successfully partner a central nervous system medication, we will have to conduct extensive clinical trials at our own expense to determine safety and efficacy of the indication that we are pursuing.

&#160;

Environmental Compliance 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s operations are cloud-based, involve software algorithms and are administrative in nature. Therefore, the Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2016, our Neurometric Services operation had six full-time employees and three part-time independent contractors. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees belong to a union.

Corporate Background 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in Delaware on March 20, 1987, under the name Age Research, Inc. Prior to January 16, 2007, the Company (then called Strativation, Inc.) existed as a &#8220;shell company&#8221; with nominal assets whose sole business was to identify, evaluate and investigate various companies to acquire or with which to merge. On January 16, 2007, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with CNS Response, Inc., a California corporation formed on January 11, 2000 (&#8220;CNS California&#8221;), and CNS Merger Corporation, a California corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (&#8220;MergerCo&#8221;) pursuant to which we agreed to acquire CNS California in a merger transaction wherein MergerCo would merge with and into CNS California, with CNS California being the surviving corporation (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). On March 7, 2007, the Merger closed, CNS California became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and on the same date we changed our corporate name from Strativation, Inc. to CNS Response, Inc.

&#160;

At the meeting of shareholders of CNS Response, Inc. held on October 28, 2015, the shareholders approved a proposal to change the Company&#8217;s name to MYnd Analytics, Inc. The Company&#8217;s charter was amended on November 2, 2015.

&#160;

The Company actively operates its businesses through CNS Response, Inc. (California) and, until September 30, 2012, also operated the Neuro-Therapy Clinic, Inc. (&#8220;NTC&#8221;), which was acquired as a wholly-owned subsidiary in January 2008, when it was the Company&#8217;s largest customer. NTC operations were discontinued effective September 30, 2012, as the Company chose to focus its limited cash resources on its clinical trial. Consequently, NTC is accounted for as a discontinued operation.
