 Item 1. Business 

Saddlebrook Resorts, Inc., (the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated in the State of Florida on June 20, 1979. It was formed to acquire an existing golf course and tennis club located in Pasco County, Florida, and develop it into a condominium resort and residential homes project named Saddlebrook Resort (the &#147;Resort&#148;). In November 1988, the Company transferred its real estate development division to its prior parent company and retained only its operation of the Resort. 

The Company is currently owned by Saddlebrook Holdings, Inc., which is ultimately owned by Thomas L. Dempsey and his family. Mr. Dempsey acquired the Company from its prior parent company in November 1988. 

Based on its numerous awards, the Resort has a reputation as a world-class facility that caters to corporate meeting planners and sports enthusiasts at all skill levels. As a destination resort, it offers luxury accommodations, convention facilities, restaurants, two golf courses, tennis courts, a spa and other recreational areas. An accredited preparatory school at the Resort and an on-site real estate sales office are operated by affiliates of the Company. 

The Resort&#146;s accommodations are condominium units that have been sold to third parties or to affiliates of the Company. The majority of the condominium units participate in a rental-pooling program (the &#147;Rental Pool&#148;) that provides its owners with a percentage distribution of related room revenues minus certain fees and expenses. The remainder of the condominium units participate in a non-pooling rental program, are owner-occupied or are designated as hospitality suites or housing for young athletes independent of the rental programs. 

All of the Resort&#146;s condominium units are governed by the Saddlebrook Resort Condominium Association, Inc. (the &#147;Association&#148;) in accordance with Florida statutes. The Board of Directors for the Association is elected by the condominium unit owners. The condominium unit owners also approve an annual budget of common expenses for the Association that determines the quarterly assessments that must be paid regardless of the units&#146; participation in rental programs. 

A Resort condominium unit&#146;s participation in a rental program also requires a club membership at the Resort with its separate initiation fees and quarterly dues. The club membership is directed by a Board of Governors appointed by the Company&#146;s management. 

&#160;

The Company&#146;s operation of the Resort is not considered to be dependent upon the availability of raw materials, nor the effect of the duration of patents, licenses, franchises or concessions held. 

The Resort&#146;s business is considered to be seasonal with a higher volume of sales during the winter and spring seasons. 

Although the Resort&#146;s reputation in the conference-hosting industry is excellent, the market for these services is extremely competitive. Consequently, the Resort aggressively competes against numerous resort hotels and convention facilities both in central Florida and nationwide. 

At December 31, 2015, there were approximately 510 persons employed by the Company. The Company&#146;s management relationship with its employees is excellent and there are no collective bargaining agreements.
