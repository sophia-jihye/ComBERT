Company History 

&#160;

GreeneStone Healthcare Corporation, a Colorado corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on April 1, 1993 (&#8220;Greenestone&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), and is the surviving company of a merger, effective February 1, 1995, between the Company and Nova Natural Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Nova Delaware&#8221;). The merger was effectuated solely for the purpose of changing the Company&#8217;s domicile from Delaware to Colorado. At all times prior to 2001, the Company was engaged in the oil and gas exploration business. Nova Delaware was the successor entity to Nova Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and Power Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which merged in 1986 (&#8220;the 1986 Merger&#8221;). Prior to the 1986 Merger, Nova Petroleum Corporation and Power Resources Corporation had operated since 1979 and 1972, respectively. In 2001, the Company entered into the electronics business and this business was active in 2001 and 2002, as part of the Torita Group. After 2002, the Company continued with various stages of development in this business until 2010.

On December 29, 2015 the Company entered into a nonbinding Letter of Intent (the &#8220;LOI&#8221;) with Aurora Recovery Centre LP (&#8220;ALP&#8221; for the purchase of certain assets of ALP. This LOI has expired and the proposed transaction will not proceed.

&#160;

In February 2015, the Company finalized the terms for the acquisition of the property currently leased by the Company. The property, which is the location of GreeneStone's Muskoka addiction treatment center, encompasses approximately 48,000 square feet of buildings on 43 acres and is adjacent to Lake Muskoka in Ontario. The property has 11 separate buildings, including five detox suites, 29 residential suites, staff cottages with 13 individual bedrooms, a self-contained fitness center, kitchen and dining facilities, and several meeting and therapy rooms. Additional facilities include an indoor and outdoor pool, a tennis court, a volleyball court, a running track and nature trails. As of the date of this annual report, the Company is addressing certain due diligence items which are being resolved and once the requisite funds have been raised the transaction will be consummated.

&#160;

The purchase price for the property consists of the following; i) CAD$5,500,000 which will be funded by a mortgage bond over the property; and ii) the issue of 50,000,000 common shares in the Company, at the market price of the shares on the date of closing.

&#160;

Change in Operations 

&#160;

On April 1, 2010, the Company, pursuant to Board of Directors resolution, changed its principal operations from development stage electronics to healthcare services. On March 29, 2010, the Company entered into a one year consulting agreement with Greenestone Clinic Inc., a Canadian corporation (&#8220;Greenestone Clinic&#8221;), whereby Greenestone Clinic provided consulting services for the Company&#8217;s development and operation of medical clinics in the province of Ontario, Canada. Specifically, Greenestone provided medical and business expertise in the initial startup of private clinics and technical assistance to ensure that the clinics were in compliance with governmental policy and procedure requirements as well as any operational requirements. At the time of entering into this consulting agreement, Greenestone Clinic operated a clinic at the Muskoka property now housing its addiction treatment clinic and provided endoscopy services that the Company had planned to offer in its first Ontario medical clinic.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160; 

On May 15, 2010, the Company secured a sublease of space (which was previously the Rothbart Pain Clinic) of approximately 8,000 sq. ft. to be used as the Company&#8217;s executive offices and to run an endoscopy clinic, which was subsequently sold. The Company started offering medical services in June 2010, offering various medical services, including endoscopy, cardiology and executive medicals, which services were subsequently sold as part of the sale of our subsidiary, 1816191 Ontario (&#8220;1816191&#8221;) during December 2014. 

&#160;

In March 2011, Greenestone Clinic, a former Company consultant, gave up the premises in Bala, Ontario, previously leased by Greenestone Clinic and operated as a private medical resort and also allowed the Company to do business using the &#8220;GreeneStone&#8221; name. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary GreeneStone Clinic Muskoka Inc. (&#8220;GreeneStone Muskoka&#8221;) entered into a lease with the owner of the Muskoka premises on April 1, 2011. The Company offers only mental health and addiction treatment services at this location which operates as an in- patient addiction treatment center.

&#160;

On December 17, 2014, the Company completed the sale of all of the outstanding shares of its subsidiary, 1816191, for the sum of CAD$1,282,002, comprised of the agreed purchase price of CAD$1,250,000 and the acquisition of net assets at closing of CAD$32,002. The sale was made pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement, dated October 6, 2014, by and between the Company and Jaintheelal Parekh Medicine Professional Corporation (&#8220;Jaintheelal&#8221;). The Company and Jaintheelal entered into a revised Share Purchase Agreement on December 16, 2014.

&#160;

Jaintheelal is owned by Dr. Jay Parekh, the Company&#8217;s former Medical director in charge of Endoscopy. The sale price of CAD$1,282,002 included the assumption by Jaintheelal of debt in the same amount as the sale price, which debt was owed by 1816191 to the Company in the amount of CAD$895,496 and to Jaintheelal of CAD$386,542. At closing, Jaintheelal offset the assumed debt to the registrant of CAD$895,496 by US$277,500 through the cancellation of 2,408,268 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, for a net amount due to the Company of US$493,807. The remainder of the assumed debt owed by 1816191 to the Company was originally due to the Company on June 30, 2015, which due date was extended to December 31, 2015, this loan has not been extended beyond this date as of the date hereof, is in the form of an interest bearing note with a coupon of 5% per annum.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s principal operations are now the provision of addiction treatment services.

&#160;

Corporate Structure 

&#160; 

The Company currently has one, wholly owned, operating subsidiary, GreeneStone Muskoka. 

&#160; 

GreeneStone Muskoka Treatment Center 

&#160;

On February 1, 2011, Dr. Paul Garfunkel was retained on a six-month consulting contract to advise the Company on its plan to go into the addiction treatment business. Dr. Garfunkel formed a Clinical Advisory Group (&#8220;CAG&#8221;) including himself, Dr. Clive Chamberlain, Dr. Greg Donahue and Janice Harris R.N. The CAG created the mission and protocols for the addiction treatment business and was tasked to hire a leader for the addiction treatment business.

&#160;

On April 1, 2011, the Company through GreeneStone Muskoka, entered into a lease (the &#8220;Bala Lease&#8221;) with Cranberry Cove Holdings Ltd. (&#8220;Cranberry&#8221;), the owner of the Bala, Ontario property (the &#8220;Bala Property&#8221;) in order to operate a mental health and addiction treatment center at the property. On April 1, 2011 (the &#8220;Purchase Date&#8221;), GreeneStone Muskoka purchased all of the assets of Greenestone Clinic that were previously used for the operation of the executive medical center located at the Bala Property. This gave GreeneStone Muskoka a turnkey opportunity to start up its addiction treatment business (the &#8220;GreeneStone Muskoka Treatment Center&#8221;).

&#160;

On April 1, 2011, Dr. Susan K. Blank was hired under a one-year contract to run the GreeneStone Muskoka Treatment Center. Dr. Blank worked with the CAG to refine the mission and protocols for the GreeneStone Muskoka Treatment Center and worked on the policies and procedures for the operation of the treatment center. 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160; 

In August 2011, the GreeneStone Muskoka Treatment Center began providing addiction treatment services and took its first paying clients. The GreeneStone Muskoka Treatment Center offers clients a 45day program that costs between CAD$27,000 and CAD$37,000 per treatment period. Treatment is individualized, providing the first two weeks of treatment, with an assessment thereafter and often, a recommendation to extend treatment. The treatment offered is concurrent, with addiction and co-occurring mental health disorders treated at the same time. The center has a 36 bed capacity and can easily be expanded beyond that capacity. Treatment consists of group and individual therapy, as well as recreation therapy. Clients are taught about nutrition and are provided with nutritious food while in treatment.

&#160;

In November of 2011, the CAG was disbanded after achieving its goals. In March 2012, Dr. Blank and two contract therapists, all of whom were from the United States, were replaced by a more permanent team of Canadian doctors and therapists.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, GreeneStone Healthcare Corporation had no employees and its subsidiary GreeneStone Clinic Muskoka had approximately 32 employees.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

The addiction treatment business operates as a private pay service. The customers get no government or OHIP subsidy to attend our treatment facility. The decision to attend the treatment center is made by each individual, making it important to market our services to the individual. There are a large number of mental health professionals that refer to the treatment center and we ensure that we maintain contact with and market to these professionals. Our marketing efforts are long term processes of establishing relationships with relevant professionals and our treatment staff. We use industry specific conferences and functions to network with these professionals.

&#160;

Approximately 70% of our clients are sourced via the Internet. This is the single biggest focus for our marketing team, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is very important and the Company aggressively seeks the maximum cost/benefit relationships with specialist firms in this field. We believe our marketing efforts are successful and effective.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The private pay addiction treatment business is not well established in Canada and there are only a few competitors that provide these services. Two of the biggest providers are also government hospital licensed facilities, that do both OHIP insured services and privately paid services. Most hospitals have a mental health unit that can handle detoxification, but do not provide addiction treatment programs. There is only one large competitor with a similar offering to GreeneStone Muskoka, located on the west coast of Canada. There are hundreds of private paid facilities in the United States and they collectively, represent a major competitor for those with the ability to pay for addiction services. Addiction service facilities in the United States that offer the same level of treatment offered by our Company are generally 50% to 100% more expensive than we are. We believe that travel to the United States by potential customers with potential travel restrictions as well as the higher cost eliminates many U.S. facilities as competition.

&#160;

Environmental Regulations 

&#160;

The Company is not currently subject to any pending administrative or judicial enforcement proceedings arising under environmental laws or regulations. Environmental laws and regulations may be adopted in the future which may have an impact upon the Company&#8217;s operations.
