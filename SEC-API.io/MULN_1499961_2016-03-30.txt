Net Element and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Net Element,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our,&#8221; unless the context requires otherwise. 

&#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

Net Element is a global transaction processing technology and value-added solutions company that enables its clients to meet their transaction processing needs through various integrated technology platforms, including in omni-channel environments that span across point-of-sale (&#8220;POS&#8221;), e-commerce and mobile devices. The Company operates in three operating segments as a provider of North America Transaction Solutions, Mobile Payment Solutions, Online Payment Solutions, and Corporate Overhead. 

&#160;

We enable merchants of all sizes to accept and process credit, debit and prepaid payments and provide them value-added services and technologies, such as POS solutions, security solutions and fraud management, information solutions and analytical tools.

&#160;

We provide a range of solutions to our clients across the value chain of commerce-enabling services and technologies. We create our value-added solutions from a suite of proprietary technology products, software, cloud-based applications, processing services, security offerings, and customer support programs that we configure to meet our clients&#8217; individual needs.

&#160;

We provide additional services including:

&#160;

&#183; POS solutions and other adjacent business services throughout the United States provided by TOT Payments doing business as Unified Payments ; &#183; Proprietary cloud-based POS platform for the hospitality industry and small to medium sized businesses &#8220;SMB&#8221; merchants through Aptito and Restoactive ; &#183; Proprietary integrated e-commerce and mobile payments processing platform and fraud management system through PayOnline ; &#183; Integrated payment processing solutions to the travel industry, which includes integrations with various Global Distribution Systems (&#8220;GDS&#8221;) such as Amadeus&#174;, Galileo&#174;, Sabre&#174;, additional geo filters and passenger name record (PNR) through Pay-Travel service offered by PayOnline ; &#183; Integrated direct-carrier, mobile operator billing solution for small ticket content providers and merchants throughout selected emerging markets provided by Digital Provider . &#160;

We have operations and offices located within the United States (U.S.) (domestic) and outside of the U.S. (international) where sales, customer service and/or administrative personnel are based. Through U.S. based subsidiaries, the Company generates revenues from transactional services, valued-added payment services and technologies for small and medium-sized businesses (referred to as &#8220;Small and Midsized Businesses,&#8221; or &#8220;SMB&#8221;). Through international subsidiaries, the Company operates its international business with a focus on transactional services, mobile payment transactions, online payment transactions and value-added payment services and technologies in emerging countries including Europe, Asia, Russian Federation and the Commonwealth of Independent States (&#8220;CIS&#8221;). Our subsidiaries Digital Provider and PayOnline hold market leadership positions in mobile and online payments segments in Russian Federation and CIS.

&#160;

Our total bankcard processing volume for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.8 billion, a 213% increase from processing volume processed during year ended December 31, 2014. Transactions processed for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 161 million, a 104% increase from transactions processed during year ended December 31, 2014.

Our business is characterized by transaction related fees, multi-year contracts, and diverse client base, which allows us to grow alongside our clients. Our multi-year contracts allow us to achieve a high level of recurring revenues with the same clients. While the contracts typically do not specify fixed revenues to be realized thereunder, they do provide a framework for revenues to be generated based on volume of services provided during such contract&#8217;s term.

Recent Developments 

&#160;

In 2015, we completed a number of transactions and other changes in pursuit of our strategy of enhancing financial results, creating a strong operational foundation and competitive advantage. We believe the following transactions and actions have focused and strengthened our company and improved our capital structure and cash flow.

&#160;

Our primary actions during 2015 were as follows:

&#160;

&#183; Digital Provider (formerly TOT Money), exceeded 3 million recurring mobile subscribers and experienced 171% subscriber growth from January 2015 to October 2015. We also re-branded mobile payments from TOT Money to Digital Provider and began providing our own branded content which we expect will increases future revenues significantly. Branded content is reported at the transaction amount billed to the mobile subscriber. &#183; PayOnline expanded into Kyrgyzstan and signed a leading e-commerce company, Daroy.net &#183; Digital Provider expanded into Kazakhstan by creating partnership agreements with VimpelCom and Kcell to provide mobile payment services to millions of subscribers and capitalize on Kazakhstan's high growth mobile payments market. &#183; Launched payment processing in Kazakhstan through partnership with Kazkommertsbank (&#34;KAZKOM&#34;) and as a result signed premier online events ticket operator, Kassir.com &#183; Launched joint venture to focus on Gulf Cooperation Council states and India. &#183; Expanded our Aptito service offerings to over 100 payment methods. &#183; Product Launches: o Launched Restoactive , a comprehensive mobile restaurant solution. o PayOnline launched &#34; Pay-Travel &#34; to automate payments for the travel industry including integration with GDS. o PayOnline launched new mobile payment solutions for iOS to existing Windows and Android processing capabilities. o Digital Provider launched proprietary Trinity Platform. o Aptito added Europay, MasterCard&#174; and Visa&#174; &#8220;EMV&#8221; and mobile payments acceptance including Android Pay&#174;, Apple Pay&#174; and Samsung Pay&#174; to its POS offering. &#160;

2015 Acquisition 

&#160;

In May 2015, we completed the acquisition of PayOnline for a total consideration of up to $8.4 million ($3.6 million was paid in cash and $3.6 million was paid in Company&#8217;s stock), additional consideration from earn-out incentives can be up to $1.282 million and payable 50% in cash and 50% in Company&#8217;s stock based on the performance of PayOnline. We funded the cash component of the acquisition with cash on hand obtained via issuances of preferred stock. PayOnline is a proprietary integrated e-commerce and mobile payments processing platform and fraud management system, which enables online payment acceptance for multinational corporations looking to conduct business globally.

&#160;

Outlook 

&#160; 

For the year 2016, we will focus on strategic partnerships and innovative products that will further expand our services so that we are a convenient one-stop shop for payment services to a global merchant community.

&#160;

Our Mission and Vision 

&#160;

Our mission is to power global commerce and allow our clients to conduct business globally. We believe that by understanding the consumer behavior and the needs of our merchants is the most effective and, ultimately, the most profitable means to accomplish our mission and create long-term value for all stakeholders.

&#160;

We drive client growth through our in-depth knowledge of global transactional services and related value-added service offerings which separate us from the competition.

&#160;

Our vision is to set the standard for omni-channel payments acceptance and value-added service offerings with focus on creation of unified global transaction acceptance ecosystem.

&#160;

In order to achieve this vision, we seek to further develop single on-boarding, global transaction acceptance ecosystem. Manifesting this vision requires scaling our direct and indirect connectivity to multiple payment and mobile networks internationally. By operationalizing this vision, we believe that we will be able to provide centralized, global omni-channel transactional platform to our clients internationally.

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our strategy is informed by our mission to power global commerce. To continue to grow our business, our strategy is to focus on providing merchants with the ability to process a variety of electronic transactions across multiple channels. We seek to leverage the adoption of, and transition to, card, electronic and digital-based payments by expanding share in our existing markets through our distribution channels and service innovation, as well as through acquisitions to improve our offerings and scale, while also seeking to enter new markets through acquisitions around the world. We intend to continue to invest in and leverage our technology infrastructure and our people to increase our penetration in existing markets.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Key elements of our business strategy include:

&#160;

&#183; Continued investment in our core technology and new product offerings; &#183; Allocation of resources and expertise to grow in commerce and payments segments; &#183; Grow and control our distribution by adding new merchants and partners; &#183; Leverage technology and operational advantages throughout our global footprint; &#183; Expansion of our cardholder and mobile subscriber customer base; &#183; Continue to develop seamless multinational solutions for our clients; &#183; Increase monetization while creating value for our clients; &#183; Focus on continued improvement and operation excellence; and &#183; Pursue potential domestic and international acquisitions of, investments in, and alliances with companies that have high growth potential, significant market presence or key technological capabilities. &#160;

With our existing infrastructure and supplier relationships, we believe that we can accommodate expected portfolio growth. We believe that our available capacity and infrastructure will allow us to take advantage of operational efficiencies as we grow our processing volume and expand to other geographical territories.

&#160;

Market Overview 

&#160;

The financial technology and transaction processing industry is an integral part of today&#8217;s worldwide financial structure. The industry is continually evolving, driven in large part by technological advances. The benefits of card-based payments allow merchants to access a broader universe of consumers, enjoy faster settlement times and reduce transaction errors. By using credit or debit cards, consumers are able to make purchases more conveniently, whether in person, over the Internet, or by mail, fax or telephone, while gaining the benefit of loyalty programs, such as frequent flyer miles or cash back, which are increasingly being offered by credit or debit card issuers.

&#160;

In addition, consumers are also beginning to use card-based and other electronic payment methods for purchases at an earlier age in life, and increasingly for small dollar amount purchases. Given these advantages of card-based payment systems to merchants and consumers, favorable demographic trends, and the resulting proliferation of credit and debit card usage, we believe businesses will increasingly seek to accept card-based payment systems in order to remain competitive.

&#160;

Our management believes that cash transactions are becoming progressively obsolete. The proliferation of bankcards has made the acceptance of bankcard payments a virtual necessity for many businesses, regardless of size, in order to remain competitive. In addition, the advent and growth of e-commerce have marked a significant new trend in the way business is being conducted. E-commerce is dependent upon credit and debit cards, as well as other cashless payment processing methods.

&#160;

The payment processing industry continues to evolve rapidly, based on the application of new technology and changing customer needs. We intend to continue to evolve with the market to provide the necessary technological advances to meet the ever-changing needs of our market place. Traditional players in the industry must quickly adapt to the changing environment or be left behind in the competitive landscape.

We operate three reportable business operating segments: (i) North America Transaction Solutions, (ii) Mobile Solutions, and (iii) Online Solutions. Our segments are designed to establish lines of businesses that support our client base and further globalize our solutions while working seamlessly with our geographic teams across our regions: United States and Canada (North America); Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Asia Pacific (APAC) and the CIS. Management determines the reportable segments based on the internal reporting used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and to assess where to allocate resources. The principal revenue stream for all segments came from service and transaction related fees during 2015.

&#160;

Prior to May 20, 2015, we had a single reportable business segment: payment processing for electronic commerce. On May 20, 2015, we obtained financial and operational control of PayOnline, a provider of online payment processing of online transactions in emerging markets. Additionally, we rebranded our mobile payments business to Digital Provider and began reporting gross revenues for mobile payments where we provide access to branded content. Given the size of assets and revenues from PayOnline and Digital Provider, we began reporting segment information for three operating segments during the third quarter of 2015.

&#160;

Comparative segment revenues and related financial information pertaining to our segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are presented in the tables in Note 16, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements (the &#8220;Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221;), which are included elsewhere in this Report.

&#160;

&#183; Discount fees charged to a merchant for processing of a transaction.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We typically provide our services as part of a broader payment acceptance solution to our business clients across multiple channels, including:

&#160;

&#183; Retail Merchants &#8211; physical businesses or storefront locations, such as retailers, supermarkets, restaurants, hotels and other brink and mortar facilities, which we refer to as Retail . We supply our Retail merchants with POS terminals from leading manufacturers, which are Europay&#174;, MasterCard&#174;, and Visa&#174; (commonly referred to as &#8220;EMV&#8221; or &#8220;Chip&#8221;) compliant and Near Field Communication (&#8220;NFC&#8221;) capable, accepting all card brands and products, as well as alternative payment forms, such as Android Pay&#8482;, Apple Pay&#8482; and Samsung Pay. &#183; Mobile Merchants &#8211; physical businesses with remote or wireless storefront locations, such as small retail and service providers that use mobile devices with POS capabilities to accept electronic payments, which we refer to as Mobile ; and &#183; Online &#8211; online businesses or website locations, such as retailers, digital content providers, and mobile application developers with Internet-based storefronts that can be accessed through a personal computer or a mobile device, where we refer to as e-commerce . &#160;

North America Transaction Solutions Marketing . We employ a variety of go-to-market strategies in our North America Transaction Solutions segment. We mostly partner with indirect non-bank sales forces (&#8220;Sales Partners&#8221;), such as independent sales agents, independent sales groups (&#8220;ISG&#8221;), independent software vendors (&#8220;ISV&#8221;), value added resellers (&#8220;VAR&#8221;), and payment services providers (&#8220;PSP&#8221;) to sell our payment solutions to SMB merchants. We believe that this sales approach provides us with access to an experienced sales force to market our services with limited investment in sales infrastructure and management time. We believe our focus on the unique needs of SMB allows us to develop compelling offerings for our sales channels to bring to prospective merchants and provides us with a competitive advantage in our target market.

&#160;

&#160;

Sales &#38; Marketing Support &#8211; Among the services and capabilities, we provide are rapid application response time, merchant application acceptance by fax or on-line submission, superior customer service, merchant reporting and robust analytics. In addition, by controlling the underwriting process we believe we offer the ISGs more rapid and consistent review of merchant applications than may be available from other service providers. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we offer our sales organizations tailored compensation programs and unique technology applications to assist them in the sales process. We keep an open dialogue with our sales partners to address their concerns as quickly as possible and work with them in investigating chargebacks or potentially suspicious activity with the aim of ensuring our merchants do not unduly suffer downtime or the unnecessary withholding of funds.

&#160;

Sales &#38; Marketing Compensation &#8211; As compensation for their referral of merchant accounts, we pay our Sales Partners an agreed-upon recurring commission, or percentage of the income we derive from the transactions we process from the merchants they refer to us. The amount of the recurring commissions we pay to our Sales Partners varies on a case-by-case basis and depends on several factors, including but not limited to the number and type of merchants each group refers to us. We provide additional incentives to our sales partners, including, from time to time, advances and merchant acquisition bonuses that are secured by income earned from the referred merchant and repayable from future compensation that may be earned by the groups in respect to the merchants they have referred to us. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had provided merchant acquisition incentives to Sales Partners in an aggregate amount of $0.87 million and $0.34 million, respectively. Our organic growth plan calls for future incentives to be funded to our Sales Partners for referred merchants.

&#160;

Sales &#38; Marketing Pilot &#8211; In 2015, we have launched a pilot direct sales program for North America Transaction Solutions segment focusing on marketing our key products and services directly to the potential clients &#8211; merchants. Sales leads are generated primarily by our digital marketing efforts, such as search engines, social media and paid advertisement on other websites. We maintain fully automated and paperless process of client acquisition, where potential clients complete merchant application online, are certified by electronic signature, data received electronically with underwriting and boarding performed in our Sales Central platform.

&#160; 

North America Transaction Solutions. Our solutions are designed to help SMB merchants accept cashless payments in an omni-channel payment environment, which spans across POS, e-commerce and mobile devices.

&#160; 

Aptito POS Platform &#8211; We acquired Aptito , an integrated POS platform developed on Apple&#8217;s&#174; iOS mobile operating system for the hospitality industry, in June 2013 and invested in the technology to significantly enhance and expand its capabilities and features. Our goal with Aptito is to create an easy to use POS and business management solution, which incorporates everything a small business needs to help streamline every-day management, operations and payment acceptance. We have expanded the family of Aptito products to include Aptito Hospitality POS, Aptito Retail POS and Restoactive .

&#160;

&#167; Aptito Hospitality POS &#8211; proprietary, fully integrated cloud-based POS and restaurant management system developed on Apple&#8217;s&#174; iOS mobile operating system is designed to be used as a stand-alone all digital POS or be extended to include: m-POS, self ordering kiosk, digital menus, pay at the table EMV and NFC ready card readers, cash drawers, receipt and kitchen printers. The need for uptime in a hospitality environment is paramount and as such our Aptito Hospitality POS local server allows our merchants to remain online, even if the Internet connection to the cloud is lost. Our local server solution is automatically synchronized with the cloud, providing 99.99% uptime. &#160;

&#183; Aptito Retail POS &#8211; cloud-based POS solution is available on Apple&#174; iOS and Android&#174; mobile operating platforms and allows retailers to focus on their business and improve the in-store experience. Retailers are able to customize Aptito Retail POS based on their environment. Peripherals for Aptito Retail POS include a fully integrated cash drawer, thermal receipt printer, barcode scanner, barcode printer and EMV-compliant point of sale acceptance terminal. This allows retailers the ability to customize their POS solution based on their unique needs. The need for uptime in a retail environment is paramount and as such our Aptito Retail POS local server allows our merchants to remain online, even if the Internet connection to the cloud is lost. Our local server solution is automatically synchronized with the cloud, providing 99.99% uptime. &#160;

&#183; Restoactive &#8211; utilizing Aptito POS Platform architecture, we have developed and launched Restoactive , which seamlessly plugs into a current restaurant environment through integrations with some of the biggest POS and restaurant management platforms such as: MICROS&#174;, POSitouch&#174;, Aloha&#174; and Symphony&#174;. By integrating into the leading POS and restaurant management platforms, Restoactive is now accessible by over 500,000 restaurants in the United States. We believe Restoactive to be the first of its kind integrated platform, which introduces all-in-one digital menu, kiosk and m-POS application into an existing POS environment without the need to displace existing restaurant management platforms. &#160;

In addition to enhancing our ability to drive core merchant acquiring sales, Aptito allows us to earn incremental revenue from business clients. Currently, the Aptito revenue model is based on a SaaS fee, which we bill on a per station basis and additional services fee, which we bill for additional applications we offer.

&#160;

We also believe Aptito can help enhance client retention because we believe it will become core to our client&#8217; businesses and position us as a value-added partner. For example, business owners may use Aptito business management tools to manage their employees&#8217; work schedules, payroll, patron reservations, operate customer loyalty programs, manage inventory, and provide analytics on their business.

&#160;

Other POS Platforms &#8211; We act as an authorized dealer for various POS manufacturers and POS software providers and deploy these systems where our proprietary products are not the best fit. Systems we offer are fully integrated with our payment acceptance capabilities.

&#160;

Merchant Management Platform &#8211; We have developed Sales Central , a proprietary cloud-based merchant management platform. Designed to enhance responsiveness of our sales partners and improve sales efficiency. The cloud-based solution provides to both Sales Partners and merchants an integrated toolkit to more effectively manage a variety of sales, operations, reporting and accounting functions. The system is designed to improve conversion rates, technology advisory functions and to reduce deployment time for merchants. It also allows troubleshooting of merchant issues in real-time. Sales Central is currently one of the few cloud-based systems nationwide that allows Sales Partners to onboard and monitor merchants on multiple processing platforms through a single interface.

&#160;

&#183; Sales Central for Sales Partners &#8211; allows Sales Partners to onboard merchants on multiple processing platforms available in the U.S. Its merchant underwriting and boarding process is seamless and paperless. Merchant Library allows Sales Partners to safely store and retrieve any agreement, form or contract, related to merchants. Sales Partners that utilize the system are equipped with merchant pricing, residual calculations and risk management modules, which allow easier management of most of their day-to-day operations. Sales Partners compensation and merchant profitability can be managed using multi-level, single-click, drill-down navigation to pricing, detail, summary and statement information. &#160;

The ticket system allows merchants direct communication with Company&#8217;s service and technical support designed to improve the customer service experience. &#160;

&#183; Unified Insights &#8211; the integrated Unified Insights module is a business dashboard focused on &#8220;Big Data&#8221; that gives merchants a 360-degree view of their business in a more usable formats. With Unified Insights, merchants can compare current revenue, online reputation, and social media activity to their past performance and to similar business in their area. &#160;

North America Transaction Solutions Competition. Many large and small companies compete with us in providing payment processing services and related services to a wide range of merchants. Many of our current and prospective competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, more developed infrastructures, greater name recognition and/or more established relationships in the industry than we have. Because of this our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can, develop and expand their service offerings more rapidly, adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly, take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily, achieve greater economies of scale, and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their services. There are also many smaller transaction processors that provide various services to small and medium sized merchants. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Operations - The markets in which we operate are very competitive, and many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger, more established and better capitalized than we are.&#8221;

&#160;

We believe that our specific focus on smaller merchants, in addition to our understanding of the needs and risks associated with providing payment processing services to small merchants and indirect non-bank sales forces, gives us a competitive advantage over larger competitors, which have a broader market perspective and priorities. We also believe that we have a competitive advantage over competitors of a similar or smaller size that may lack our extensive experience, value-added product offering and resources.

&#160;

North America Transaction Solutions Industry Mix and Geography. In the United States, we have developed significant expertise in industries that we believe present relatively low risks as the customers are generally present and the products or services are generally delivered at the time the transaction is processed. These include:

&#160;

&#183; Restaurants &#183; Schools and educational services &#183; Brick and mortar retailers &#183; Convenience and liquor stores &#183; Professional service providers &#183; Hotel and lodging establishments &#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Merchants we served during 2015 processed an average of $12,757 each month in credit card transactions and had an average transaction value of $36.40 per transaction. Larger payment processors have traditionally underserved these merchants. As a result, these merchants have historically paid higher transaction fees than larger merchants and have not been provided with tailored solutions and on-going services that larger merchants typically receive from larger payment processing providers.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Restaurants &#160; &#160; 47.9 % &#160; &#160; 44.34 % Schools &#38; Educational Services &#160; &#160; 15.9 % &#160; &#160; 17.59 % Retail &#160; &#160; 6.0 % &#160; &#160; 5.15 % Convenience, Fast Food &#38; Liquor &#160; &#160; 5.7 % &#160; &#160; 4.75 % Professional Services &#160; &#160; 3.8 % &#160; &#160; 3.16 % Lodging &#160; &#160; 1.2 % &#160; &#160; 1.54 % Other &#160; &#160; 19.5 % &#160; &#160; 23.47 % 

&#160;

No other state represented more than 3.7% of our total SMB card processing volume. Our geographic concentration trends to reflect states where we maintain stronger sales force. We believe that the loss of any single SMB merchant would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

North America Transaction Solutions Risk Management. In the United States, we focus our sales efforts on low-risk bankcard merchants and have developed systems and procedures designed to minimize our exposure to potential merchant losses.

&#160;

Effective risk management helps us minimize merchant losses for the mutual benefit of our merchants, Independent Sales Groups and ourselves. Our Underwriting and Risk Management Policy and procedures help to protect us from fraud perpetrated by our merchants. We believe our knowledge and experience in dealing with attempted fraud has resulted in our development and implementation of effective risk management and fraud prevention systems and procedures. In 2015, we experienced losses of .008% of our SMB card processing volume.

&#160;

We employ the following systems and procedures to minimize our exposure to merchant and transaction fraud:

&#160;

&#183; Merchant Application Underwriting &#8211; there are varying degrees of risk associated with different merchant types based on their industry, the nature of the merchant&#8217;s business, processing volumes and average transaction size. As such, varying levels of scrutiny are needed to evaluate a merchant application and to underwrite a prospective merchant account. These range from basic due diligence for merchants with low risk profiles to more comprehensive review for higher risk merchants. The results of this assessment serves as the basis for decisions regarding acceptance of the merchant account, criteria for establishing reserve requirements, processing limits, average transaction amounts and pricing. Once aggregated, these factors also assist the Company in monitoring transactions for those accounts when pre-determined criteria have been exceeded. &#160;

&#183; Merchant Monitoring &#8211; we employ several levels of merchant account monitoring to help us identify suspicious transactions and trends. Daily merchant activity is sorted into a number of customized reports by our systems. Our risk management team reviews any unusual activity highlighted by these reports, such as larger than normal transactions or credits, and monitors other parameters that are helpful in identifying suspicious activity. We have daily windows to decide if any transactions should be held for further review and this provides us time to interview a merchant or issuing bank to determine the validity of suspicious transactions. We also place merchants who require special monitoring on alert status and have engaged a third-party web crawling solution that scans all merchant websites for content and integrity. &#160;

&#183; Investigation and Loss Prevention &#8211; if a merchant exceeds any parameters established by our underwriting and/or risk management staff or violates regulations established by the applicable bankcard network or the terms of our merchant agreement, one of our investigators will identify the incident and take appropriate action to reduce our exposure to loss and the exposure of our merchant. This action may include requesting additional transaction information, withholding or diverting funds, verifying delivery of merchandise or even deactivating the merchant account. Additionally, Relationship Managers may be instructed to retrieve equipment owned by us. In addition, to protect ourselves from unexpected losses, we maintain a reserve account with our sponsoring bank, which can be used to offset any losses incurred at a given time. As of December 31, 2015, our reserve balance was $350,596. The reserve is replenished as required by funding 0.03% of bankcard processing volume. This reserve is accounted for on our balance sheet under the caption &#8220;other assets&#8221;. &#160;

&#183; Reserves &#8211; some of our merchants are required to post reserves (cash deposits) that are used to offset chargebacks incurred. Our sponsoring banks hold such reserves related to our merchant accounts as long as we are exposed to loss resulting from a merchant&#8217;s processing activity. In the event that a small company finds it difficult to post a cash reserve upon opening an account with us, we may build the reserve by retaining a percentage of each transaction the merchant performs until the reserve is established. This solution permits the merchant to fund our reserve requirements gradually as its business develops. As of December 31, 2015, our total reserve deposits were approximately $570,253. We have no legal title to the cash accounts maintained at the sponsor bank in order to cover potential chargeback and related losses under the applicable merchant agreements. We also have no legal obligation to these merchants with respect to these reserve accounts. Accordingly, we do not include these accounts and the corresponding obligation to the merchants in our consolidated financial statements. &#160;

&#160;

North America Transaction Solutions Sponsoring Banks and Data Processors. Because we are not a &#8220;member bank&#8221; as defined by Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover (&#8220;Card Associations&#8221;), in order to authorize and settle payment transactions for merchants, we must be sponsored by a financial institution that holds member bank status with Card Association (&#8220;Sponsorship Bank&#8221;) and various third-party vendors (&#8220;Data Processors&#8221;) to assist us with these functions. Card Association rules restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and require that these funds be in the possession of a Sponsorship Bank until the merchant is funded.

&#160;

Sponsoring Bank . We have agreements with several banks that sponsor us for membership in the Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover card associations and settle card transactions for our merchants. The principal Sponsoring Bank through which we process the majority of our transaction in the United States is BMO Harris Bank. In addition, in February 2016, we entered into a bank identification (&#8220;BIN&#8221;) sponsorship agreement with Esquire Bank, N.A. From time to time, we may enter into agreements with additional banks. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Related to Our Business and Operations &#8211; We rely on bank sponsors, which have substantial discretion with respect to certain elements of our business practices, in order to process bankcard transactions. If these sponsorships are terminated and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate merchant portfolios to new bank sponsors, we will not be able to conduct our business.&#8221;

&#160;

Data Processor. We have agreements with several Data Processors to provide us with, on a non-exclusive basis, transaction processing and transmittal, transaction authorization and data capture, and access to various reporting tools. Our primary processing vendor in the United States is Priority Payment Systems, LLC (&#8220;Priority&#8221;), which provides us with the processing conduit to Total System Services, Inc. (&#8220;TSYS&#8221;) and First Data Resources, LLC authorization and settlement network. We have entered into several service agreements with Priority. Each of the Priority service agreements may be terminated by Priority if, among other things, (i) certain insolvency events occur with respect to us or (ii) we fail to maintain our good standing with Card Associations. We may terminate each of the agreements if, among other things, (i) certain insolvency events occur with respect to Priority, (ii) Priority materially breaches any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the agreements and fails to cure such breach within 30 days following receipt of written notice thereof, or (iii) under certain circumstances, Priority is unable to perform services described in the agreement.

&#160;

As an example of processing an electronic payment, the below diagram illustrates the participants involved in a payment transaction. There are four main participants, the Merchant, the Service Provider ( Unified Payments ), the Sponsoring Bank and the Data Processor. Merchants are primarily business owners that accept credit card payment in exchange for their merchandise and services.

&#160; 

Digital Provider&#8217;s current customers span across variety of industries and operate across different markets. Our clients include mobile operator designated companies, merchants, content and service providers. Our platform is used by over a thousand merchants.

&#160;

The discount fee is a percentage of the purchase; &#183; Processing fees charged to merchants for processing of a transaction; and &#183; Software license fees for Trinity Mobile Billing Platform. &#160;

For example, in a transaction using a mobile device as a form of payment, the allocation of funds resulting from a $10 transaction from our branded content follows.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Mobile Solutions Marketing. We employ a variety of go-to-market strategies in our Mobile Solutions segment. We mostly partner with mobile operators, broadcast media networks, internet portals and content providers, and marketing and sales promotion partners.

&#160;

&#183; Mobile Operators &#8211; Mobile operators partner with us to generate revenues for incoming traffic. Mobile operators increase revenues via additional subscription and transactional services used by its subscribers. &#183; Broadcast Media Networks &#8211; Mobile operator billing is becoming an increasingly popular communication tool on both radio &#38; TV. It provides interactivity for the viewer/listener through voting/polls/competitions, and can generate revenues for the stations/production companies. &#183; Internet Portals and Content Providers &#8211; Mobile operator billing adds a further dimension to the offering of portals and content providers. It enables information alerts, ringtones and logos, Short Messaging Service (&#8220;SMS&#8221;) sending facility for end-users, all of which can generate revenues for the Company. &#183; Marketing and Sales Promotion Partners &#8211; Mobile operator billing is being used as a new marketing channel. Its immediacy; directness and 2-way communication lends itself to effective measurable marketing and promotion. Integration with existing media adds a new dimension to marketing campaigns (e.g. outdoor, press, on-pack, and direct mail). &#160;

Other industries using mobile messaging and mobile billing solutions include banking, retailing, brokering, tourism, transportation, games, and education.

&#160; 

Mobile Solutions. Our solutions are designed to help digital merchants accept mobile payments transactions utilizing direct billing access to MNOs in emerging markets.

&#160;

Trinity Mobile Billing Platform &#8211; We have developed, Trinity Platform , proprietary high-performance mobile acceptance, billing and content aggregation platform for value-added services (&#8220;VAS&#8221;). With the help of Trinity Platform, our partners can aggregate mobile traffic utilizing the most popular methods of monetization on the VAS market.

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Reporting and Analytics &#8211; Trinity Platform&#8217;s powerful dashboard provides our digital merchants and content providers with a real-time overview of revenue and reports on processed transactions: which countries have the biggest number of users, how much these users are paying and which content is more popular. This data helps our digital merchants and content providers fine-tune their monetization strategy. &#160;

Mobile Solutions Competition. Digital Provider primarily competes with other companies operating in the mobile payment processing market in emerging markets. Certain competitors have been in business longer than Digital Provider and have significantly greater financial and other resources than Digital Provider. In order to successfully increase our business in that market, we must convince content providers to use Digital Provider&#8217;s services over competitive platforms that may already be in use. Digital Provider must also retain good relations with MNOs providing service. We believe that Digital Provider will be able to effectively compete in the mobile payment processing market in Russia based primarily upon services offered, functionality and ease of use of features offered. Failure to successfully continue developing Digital Provider&#8217;s payment processing operations, maintain Digital Provider&#8217;s existing contracts with MNOs and content providers and enter into additional contracts with content providers to use Digital Provider&#8217;s services may harm our revenue and business prospects.

&#160; 

Mobile Solutions Risk Management. We are responsible for content compliance and merchant underwriting and are subject to chargebacks for the full value of the transaction. If any such chargebacks arise we pass these chargebacks to our merchants, in the event we are unsuccessful in passing these charges to the merchant we are responsible for these chargebacks. In 2015 we had no losses from our mobile payments processing volume as all chargebacks were collected from content partners and aggregators.

&#160;

Mobile Solutions Licensing and Certifications. The relationships between Digital Provider and telecommunications carriers in Russia are governed by the general rules of civil law for the provision of services (Chapter 39 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation). In addition, because the &#8220;information and entertainment services&#8221; (content services) provided by Digital Provider are inextricably linked with the networks of telecommunications carriers, these services are subject to the requirements of the Rules of Mobile Communications Services Provision, approved by the Decree of the Russian Federation Government dated May 25, 2005 No. 328. These Rules govern the relationship between a customer using mobile communication services and a telecommunications carrier in respect of mobile radio communications services, mobile radiotelephone services and/or mobile satellite radio services in the public network. Although Digital Provider is not a telecommunications carrier, many requirements of such rules are present in Digital Provider&#8217;s contracts with telecommunications carriers, and such contracts impose responsibility and liability on Digital Provider for violations.

&#160;

Digital Provider has a license to provide telematics services in Russia. Digital Provider is considered an operator of telematics services in Russia because it has a direct connection to equipment of telecommunications carriers and it affects electronic communications (i.e., receiving, processing and/or transmitting electronic messages). Operators of telematics services in Russia are regulated by the Federal Law &#8220;On Communication&#8221; dated July 2, 2003 No. 126-FZ. This Federal Law provides the legal basis for activity in the field of communications in the Russian Federation and territories under the Russian Federation jurisdiction, defines the powers of public authorities in the field of communications, as well as the rights and responsibilities of persons involved in such activities or using communication services. Digital Provider also is subject to the Rules of Telematics Services Provision approved by the Decree of the Russian Federation Government dated September 10, 2007 No. 575. These Rules govern the relationship between a customer or a user, on the one hand, and a telecommunications carrier providing telematics communication services, on the other hand, in the provision of telematics communication services.

&#160;

Mobile Solutions Mobile Network Operators. In order for us to provide payment and SMS messaging services to mobile subscribers and debit their accounts for payments, we need to have contractual agreements with marketing subsidiaries of mobile operators, which allow us to bill mobile subscribers. We have direct and indirect agreements with mobile operators and mobile operator aggregators in over 40 countries. The three largest mobile operators through which we process the majority of our transactions are: Mobile TeleSystem OJSC (&#8220;MTS&#8221;), MegaFon OJSC (&#8220;MegaFon&#8221;) and OJSC VimpelCom (&#8220;VimpelCom&#8221;). These contracts with mobile operator subsidiaries, allow us to facilitate payments using SMS, Multimedia Messaging Services (&#8220;MMS&#8221;) and WAP for their mobile phone subscribers. From time to time, we may enter into agreements with additional mobile operators and mobile operator aggregators. In addition, we also have contracts and our platform is integrated with various mobile operator aggregators, which give us access to mobile operator networks in approximately 50 countries.

&#160;

As an example of processing a mobile transaction, the below diagram illustrates the participants involved in a mobile payment transaction. There are six main participants, the Mobile User, the Mobile Operator, the Transaction Processor ( Digital Provider ), the Merchant, the Processing Platform ( Trinity Platform ) and the Mobile Applications.

Online Solutions Sponsoring Banks and Data Processors. Because we are not a &#8220;member bank&#8221; or a licensed financial services institution as defined by Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover (&#8220;Card Associations&#8221;), in order to authorize and settle payment transactions for merchants, we must be partner with a financial institution that holds member bank status with Card Association (&#8220;Partner Bank&#8221;) and various third-party vendors (&#8220;Data Processors&#8221;) to assist us with these functions. Card Association rules restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and require that these funds be in the possession of a Partner Bank until the merchant is funded.

&#160;

Partner Bank . Since 2008, PayOnline has been working to increase the number of partnership agreements and platform integrations with different banks, financial institutions and payment processors. Our worldwide expansion requires a broader range of regions and currencies covered by such partnership agreements, enabling us to provide international payment processing.

&#160;

Our key partnerships and integrations in Russian Federation include:

&#160;

&#183; Bank of Moscow &#183; QIWI Bank &#183; VTB 24 &#183; WebMoney &#183; Raiffesenbank &#183; Yandex.Money &#160;

Our key partnerships and integrations in Europe, Asia and United States include:

As an example of processing an electronic payment, the below diagram illustrates the participants involved in a payment transaction. There are four main participants, the Merchant, the Service Provider ( PayOnline ), the Partner Bank and the Data Processor ( PayOnline ). Merchants are primarily business owners that accept credit card payment in exchange for their merchandise and services.

Corporate History 

&#160;

Our Company was formed in 2010 and incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability under the name Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd. (&#8220;Cazador&#8221;). Cazador was a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger; share capital exchange; asset acquisition; share purchase; reorganization or similar business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets. In 2012, Cazador completed a merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) with Net Element, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was a company with businesses in the online media and mobile commerce payment processing markets. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, the Company (then known as Cazador) changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by discontinuing as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Effective upon consummation of the Merger, (i) Net Element, Inc. was merged with and into the Company, resulting in Net Element ceasing to exist and the Company continuing as the surviving company in the Merger, and (ii) the Company changed its name to Net Element International, Inc. In 2013, the Company divested its non-core entertainment assets. In December 2013, the Company changed its name to Net Element, Inc. We entered the mobile payments business through the launch of Tot Money (renamed Digital Provider in 2015) in Russia in 2012. We entered the financial technology and value-added transactional service business through the acquisitions of Unified Payments in April 2013 and Aptito in June 2013. We entered the online payment business with our acquisition of PayOnline in May 2015. Our principal office is located at 3363 NE 163 rd Street, Suite 705, North Miami Beach, Florida 33160, and our main telephone number is (305) 507-8808.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Various aspects of our business are subject to U.S. and non-U.S. federal, state and local regulation. The operations of our subsidiary, Digital Provider, are subject to regulation in non-U.S. markets it operates in and may become subject to the laws and regulations of additional foreign jurisdictions as and when its business expands into additional markets. Many domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and companies transmitting user information and payments via text message or other electronic means are still evolving and the interpretation of such laws and regulations are often uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations, the limitation, suspension or termination of services and/or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and/or fines. The services of Digital Provider to mobile phone carriers also are subject to certain of the rules and policies of such carriers and ongoing contractual covenants with such carriers, the violation of which may result in penalties and/or fines and possible termination of Digital Provider&#8217;s services. Certain of our services are also subject to rules set by various payment networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, as more fully described below under &#8220;Association and Network Rules&#8221;.

&#160;

Association and Network Rules . While not legal or governmental regulation, we are subject to the network rules of Visa, MasterCard and other payment networks. In order to provide processing services, a number of our subsidiaries are registered with Visa and/or MasterCard as service providers for member institutions. Various subsidiaries of ours are also processor level members of numerous networks or are otherwise subject to various network rules in connection with processing services and other services we provide. As such, we are subject to applicable card association, networks and national scheme rules that could subject us to fines or penalties. The payment networks routinely update and modify their requirements. On occasion, we receive notices of non-compliance and fines, which might be related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures. Our failure to comply with the networks&#8217; requirements or to pay the fines they impose could cause the termination of our registration and require us to stop providing payment services.

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Act . In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 was signed into law in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to regulate consumer financial services, including many offered by our clients.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act provided two self-executing statutory provisions limiting the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions that became effective in July 2010. The first provision allows merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards). The second provision allows merchants to provide discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers.

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Separately, the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions will now be regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. Payment network fees, such as switch fees may not be used directly or indirectly to compensate card issuers in circumvention of the interchange transaction fee restrictions. In July 2011, the Federal Reserve published the final rules governing debit interchange fees. Effective in October 2011, debit interchange rates for card issuing financial institutions with more than $10 billion of assets are capped at $0.21 per transaction with an additional component of five basis points of the transaction&#8217;s value to reflect a portion of the issuer&#8217;s fraud losses plus, for qualifying issuing financial institutions, an additional $0.01 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs. The debit interchange fee would be $0.24 per transaction on a $38 debit card transaction, the average transaction size for debit card transactions. In July 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia determined that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations implementing the Durbin Amendment were invalid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or D.C. Circuit, reversed this decision on March 21, 2014, generally upholding the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interpretation of the Durbin Amendment and the Federal Reserve&#8217;s rules implementing it. On August 18, 2014, the plaintiffs in this litigation filed a petition for a writ of certiorari asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the D.C. Circuit&#8217;s decision with respect to the interchange fee cap. We continue to monitor developments in the litigation surrounding these rules. Regardless of the outcome of the litigation, the cap on interchange fees is not expected to have a material direct impact on our results of operations.

&#160;

In addition, the new rules contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions. Beginning in October 2011, (i) a card payment network may not prohibit a card issuer from contracting with any other card payment network for the processing of electronic debit transactions involving the issuer&#8217;s debit cards and (ii) card issuing financial institutions and card payment networks may not inhibit the ability of merchants to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any card payment networks that can process the transactions. Since April 2012, most debit card issuers have been required to enable at least two unaffiliated card payment networks on each debit card. We do not expect the prohibition on network exclusivity to impact our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our clients. These regulatory changes create both opportunities and challenges for us. Increased regulation may add to the complexity of operating a payment processing business, creating an opportunity for larger competitors to differentiate themselves both in product capabilities and service delivery.

&#160;

Federal Trade Commission Act and Other Laws Impacting our Customers&#8217; Business . All persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchant and financial institution customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or UDAP. In addition, there are other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act, that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant&#8217;s payment processor, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the states&#8217; attorney general have authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in UDAP or violate other laws, rules and regulations and to the extent we are processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may impact our business.

&#160;

Rules and Policies of and Contractual Covenants with Mobile Phone Carriers . While not governmental regulation, Digital Provider is subject to certain of the rules and policies of mobile phone carriers to which Digital Provider provides payment processing services and ongoing contractual covenants with such mobile phone carriers. The mobile phone carriers may from time to time update or otherwise modify or supplement their rules and policies. Digital Provider periodically is subject to the imposition of fines or penalties as a result of failure to comply with such rules, policies and/or contractual covenants. Digital Provider&#8217;s failure to comply with the mobile phone carriers&#8217; respective requirements or to pay the fines or penalties they impose could result in the termination of Digital Provider&#8217;s services.

&#160;

Laws and Rules of the Russian Federation . The relationships between Digital Provider (formerly known as TOT Money) and telecommunications carriers in Russia are governed by the general rules of civil law for the provision of services (Chapter 39 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation). In addition, because the &#8220;information and entertainment services&#8221; (content services) provided by Digital Provider are inextricably linked with the networks of telecommunications carriers, these services are subject to the requirements of the Rules of Mobile Communications Services Provision, approved by the Decree of the Russian Federation Government dated May 25, 2005 No. 328. These Rules govern the relationship between a customer using mobile communication services and a telecommunications carrier in respect of mobile radio communications services, mobile radiotelephone services and/or mobile satellite radio services in the public network. Although Digital Provider is not a telecommunications carrier, many requirements of such Rules are present in Digital Provider&#8217;s contracts with telecommunications carriers, and such contracts impose responsibility and liability on Digital Provider for violations.

&#160;

Digital Provider has a license for the provision of telematics services in Russia. Digital Provider is considered an operator of telematics services in Russia because it has a direct connection to equipment of telecommunications carriers and it affects electronic communications (i.e., receiving, processing and/or transmitting electronic messages). Operators of telematics services in Russia are regulated by the Federal Law &#8220;On Communication&#8221; dated July 2, 2003 No. 126-FZ. This Federal Law provides the legal basis for activity in the field of communications in the Russian Federation and territories under the Russian Federation jurisdiction, defines the powers of public authorities in the field of communications, as well as the rights and responsibilities of persons involved in such activities or using communication services. Digital Provider also is subject to the Rules of Telematics Services Provision approved by the Decree of the Russian Federation Government dated September 10, 2007 No. 575. These Rules govern the relationship between a customer or a user, on the one hand, and a telecommunications carrier providing telematics communication services, on the other hand, in the provision of telematics communication services.

&#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The activity of Digital Provider to some extent is regulated by the Federal Law &#8220;On Operational and Investigative Activities&#8221; dated August 12, 1995 No. 144-FZ. This Federal Law determines the content of the operational and investigative activities in the Russian Federation, and provides for a system of guarantees in the process of operational and investigative operations. Operational and investigative activities include activities carried out openly and secretly by operational branches of certain government bodies in order to protect life, health, rights and freedoms of the person and the citizen, property, security of the society and the state from criminal attacks.

&#160;

In carrying out activities on the Internet in Russia, Digital Provider is subject to the Federal Law &#8220;On Advertising&#8221; dated March 13, 2006 No. 38-FZ. The objectives of this Federal Law are the development of markets for goods and services based on the principles of fair competition, ensuring the common economic space in the Russian Federation, the realization of the rights of consumers to receive fair and accurate advertising, creating favorable conditions for the production and distribution of public service announcements, preventions of violations of the Russian Federation on advertising, as well as the suppression of improper advertising. Digital Provider&#8217;s activities on the Internet in Russia also are subject to the Federal Law &#8220;On Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Health&#8221; dated December 29, 2010 No. 436-FZ. This Federal Law provides regulations protecting children from information harmful to their health and/or development.

&#160;

Concerning relations with Federal communication service providers, Digital Provider can be involved in regulation of personal data of subscribers. In case of transferring by Federal communication service providers&#8217; information which includes personal data Digital Provider has to take measures to protect such data as the operator of personal data must take. The list of such measures is described in Federal Law &#8220;On Personal Data&#8221; dated 27.07.2006 No 152. This Federal Law and Federal Law &#8220;On Communication&#8221; establish rules of usage of personal data of subscribers. Taking into account that this regulation is to be applied only in case of transferring information with personal data from Federal communication service providers it is important to clarify that common execution of contracts with these providers do not stipulate transferring of personal data.

&#160;

Other Laws and Regulations 

&#160;

Since we collect certain information from members and users on our platform, it will be subject to current and future government regulations regarding the collection, use and safeguarding of consumer information over the Internet and mobile communication devices. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, user privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection and electronic payment services. In many cases, it may be unclear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet or mobile communication services as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of these technologies and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet and e-commerce.

&#160;

There are a number of legislative proposals that are anticipated or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies, and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us. Many states, for example, have already passed laws requiring notification to subscribers when there is a security breach of personal data. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

Legislation could be passed that limits our ability to use or store information about our users. The Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;) and various states have established regulatory guidelines issued under the Federal Trade Commission Act and various state acts, respectively, that govern the collection, use and storage of consumer information, establishing principles relating to notice, consent, access and data integrity and security. Our practices are designed to comply with these guidelines. For example, we disclose that we collect a range of information about our users, such as their names, email addresses, search histories and activity on our platform. We also use and store such information primarily to personalize the experience on our platforms, provide customer support and display relevant advertising. While we do not sell or share personally identifiable information with third parties for direct marketing purposes, we do have relationships with third parties that may allow them access to user information for other purposes.

&#160;

We believe our policies and practices comply with the FTC privacy guidelines and other applicable laws and regulations. However, if our belief proves incorrect, or if these guidelines, laws or regulations or their interpretations change or new legislation or regulations are enacted, we may be compelled to provide additional disclosures to our users, obtain additional consents from our users before collecting or using their information or implement new safeguards to help our users manage our (or others&#8217;) use of their information, among other changes.

&#160;

Russia Sanctions 

&#160; 

In March 2014, the Crimea region of the Ukraine was annexed by Russia. In response to this annexation and subsequent hostilities aimed at the Ukraine, other nations, including the United States and the European Union, imposed evolving economic sanctions against Russia. U.S. and European concerns related to the political and military conditions in the region have prompted increasing levels of economic sanctions, targeting certain Russian companies in the finance, energy and defense industries and named Russian nationals that have been deemed to have direct involvement in destabilizing the situation in the Ukraine, as well as imposing restrictions on trading and access to capital markets (&#8220;Russian Sanctions&#8221;). In response, Russia announced its own trading sanctions against nations that implemented or supported the Russian Sanctions, including the United States and some European Union nations. Much of our present operations are being conducted in Russia. In the event that the United States&#8217; and the European Union&#8217;s political relationships with Russia further deteriorate, it is possible that additional and even more severe sanctions could be imposed by the United States or European Union against Russia or that Russia could impose additional retaliatory measures in response to current or future Russian Sanctions. If this should happen, our electronic payments operations conducted in Russia could be scaled back or shut down, which may require additional funding to penetrate or expand alternative electronic payments markets outside of Russia. If we are found to be in violation of Russian Sanctions, we may incur significant fines and other penalties.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

Historically, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. Revenues have been weaker during the first quarter of the calendar year and stronger during the second, third and fourth quarters. We expect our business to continue experiencing seasonal fluctuations consistent with this historical pattern.
