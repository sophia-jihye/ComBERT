 Item 1. Business 

General 

Rockwell Automation, Inc. ("Rockwell Automation" or "the Company"), a leader in industrial automation and information, makes its customers more productive and the world more sustainable . Our products, solutions and services are designed to meet our customers&#8217; needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce enterprise business risk. 

The Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985. 

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&#38;D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&#38;D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC&#8217;s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC. RIC was incorporated in 1928. 

As used herein, the terms &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;Rockwell Automation&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; include subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated. 

Whenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on February 7, 2017 &#32;(the Proxy Statement), or to information under specific captions in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;(MD&#38;A), or in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#32;(the Financial Statements), the information is incorporated in that Item by reference. All date references to years and quarters refer to our fiscal year and quarters unless otherwise stated. 

Operating Segments

Our Architecture &#38; Software operating segment recorded sales of $2.64 billion &#32;( 45 percent &#32;of our total sales) in 2016 . Our Control Products &#38; Solutions operating segment recorded sales of $3.24 billion &#32;( 55 percent &#32;of our total sales) in 2016 . 

Our Architecture &#38; Software operating segment is headquartered in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, and our Control Products &#38; Solutions operating segment is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Both operating segments share a common sales organization and supply chain and conduct business globally. Major markets served by both segments consist of consumer industries, including food and beverage, home and personal care and life sciences; transportation, including automotive and tire; and heavy industries, including oil and gas, mining and metals.
