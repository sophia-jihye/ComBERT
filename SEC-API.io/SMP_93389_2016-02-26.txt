Business Strategy

Our goal is to grow revenues and earnings and deliver returns in excess of our cost of capital by providing high quality original equipment and replacement products to the engine management and temperature control markets. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

&#183; Maintain Our Strong Competitive Position in the Engine Management and Temperature Control Businesses. &#160; We are one of the leading independent manufacturers and distributors serving North America and other geographic areas in our core businesses of Engine Management and &#160; Temperature Control. We believe that our success is attributable to our emphasis on product quality, the breadth and depth of our product lines for both domestic and import vehicles, and our reputation for outstanding value-added services. 

To maintain our strong competitive position in our markets, we remain committed to the following:

&#183; providing our customers with broad lines of high quality engine management and temperature control products, supported by the highest level of value-added services; 

&#183; continuing to maximize our production, supply chain and distribution efficiencies; 

&#183; continuing to improve our cost position through increased global sourcing and increased manufacturing in low cost regions; and 

&#183; focusing on our engineering development efforts including a focus on bringing more product manufacturing in house. 

&#183; Provide Superior Value-Added Services, Product Availability and Technical Support. &#160; Our goal is to increase sales to existing and new customers by leveraging our skills in rapidly filling orders, maintaining high levels of product availability, providing insightful customer category management, and providing technical support in a cost&#8209;effective manner. In addition, our category management and technically skilled sales force professionals provide product selection, assortment and application support to our customers. 

&#183; Expand Our Product Lines. We intend to increase our sales by continuing to develop internally, or through acquisitions, the range of Engine Management and Temperature Control products that we offer to our customers. We are committed to investing the resources necessary to maintain and expand our technical capability to manufacture multiple product lines that incorporate the latest technologies . 

&#183; Broaden Our Customer Base. &#160; Our goal is to increase our customer base by (a) continuing to leverage our manufacturing capabilities to secure additional original equipment business globally with automotive, industrial, marine, military and heavy duty vehicle and equipment manufacturers and their service part operations as well as our existing customer base including traditional warehouse distributors, large retailers, other manufacturers and export customers, and (b) supporting the service part operations of vehicle and equipment manufacturers with value added services and product support for the life of the part. 

&#183; Improve Operating Efficiency and Cost Position. &#160; Our management places significant emphasis on improving our financial performance by achieving operating efficiencies and improving asset utilization, while maintaining product quality and high customer order fill rates. We intend to continue to improve our operating efficiency and cost position by: 

&#183; increasing cost&#8209;effective vertical integration in key product lines through internal development; 

&#183; focusing on integrated supply chain management, customer collaboration and vendor managed inventory initiatives; 

&#183; evaluating additional opportunities to relocate manufacturing to our low-cost plants located outside of the U.S.; 

&#160;

&#183; maintaining and improving our cost effectiveness and competitive responsiveness to better serve our customer base, including sourcing certain materials and products from low cost regions such as those in Asia without compromising product quality; 

&#183; enhancing company&#8209;wide programs geared toward manufacturing and distribution efficiency; and 

&#183; focusing on company&#8209;wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction programs. 

&#183; Cash Utilization. &#160; We intend to apply any excess cash flow from operations and the management of working capital primarily to reduce our outstanding indebtedness, pay dividends to our shareholders, repurchase shares of our common stock, expand our product lines and grow revenues through acquisitions. 

The Automotive Aftermarket

The automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large number of diverse manufacturers varying in product specialization and size. In addition to manufacturing, aftermarket companies allocate resources towards an efficient distribution process and product engineering in order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend. Aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient producers of small lot sizes and do not have to provide systems engineering support. Aftermarket manufacturers also must distribute, with rapid turnaround times, products for a full range of domestic and import vehicles on the road. The primary customers of the automotive aftermarket manufacturers are national and regional warehouse distributors, large retail chains, automotive repair chains and the dealer service networks of original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;).

The automotive aftermarket industry differs substantially from the OEM supply business. Unlike the OEM supply business that primarily follows trends in new car production, the automotive aftermarket industry&#8217;s performance primarily tends to follow different trends, such as:

&#183; growth in number of vehicles on the road; 

&#183; increase in average vehicle age; 

&#183; change in total miles driven per year; 

&#183; new or modified environmental and vehicle safety regulations, including fuel-efficiency and emissions reduction standards; 

&#183; increase in pricing of new cars; 

&#183; economic and financial market conditions; 

&#183; new car quality and related warranties; 

&#183; changes in automotive technologies; 

&#183; change in vehicle scrap rates; and 

&#183; change in average fuel prices. 

Traditionally, the parts manufacturers of OEMs and the independent manufacturers who supply the original equipment (&#8220;OE&#8221;) part applications have supplied a majority of the business to new car dealer networks. However, certain parts manufacturers have become more independent and are no longer affiliated with OEMs, which has provided, and may continue to provide, opportunities for us to supply replacement parts to the dealer service networks of the OEMs, both for warranty and out&#8209;of&#8209;warranty repairs.

Engine Management Segment

Breadth of Products .

We manufacture a full line of engine management replacement parts including, electronic ignition control modules, fuel injectors, remanufactured diesel injectors and pumps, ignition wires, coils, switches, relays, EGR valves, distributor caps and rotors, various sensors primarily measuring temperature, pressure and position in numerous vehicle systems (such as camshaft and crankshaft position, fuel pressure, vehicle speed, tire pressure monitoring (TPMS) and mass airflow sensors), electronic throttle bodies and many other engine management components primarily under our brand names Standard&#174;, Blue Streak&#174;, BWD&#174;, Select&#174;, Intermotor&#174;, OEM&#174;, LockSmart&#174;, TechSmart&#174;, Tech Expert&#174; and GP Sorensen&#174;, and through co-labels and private labels such as CARQUEST&#174; BWD&#174;, CARQUEST&#174; Intermotor&#174;, Duralast&#174;, Duralast Gold&#174;, Import Direct&#174;, Master Pro&#174;, NAPA&#174;, NAPA&#174; Echlin&#174;, NAPA Proformer TM Mileage Plus&#174; and NAPA&#174; Belden&#174;. We are a basic manufacturer of many of the engine management parts we market. Our strategy includes expanding our product lines through strategic acquisitions in addition to sourcing certain materials and products from low cost regions such as those in Asia. In our Engine Management Segment, replacement parts for ignition, emission control and fuel systems accounted for approximately 63% of our consolidated net sales in 2015, 62% of our consolidated net sales in 2014 and 61% of our consolidated net sales in 2013.

&#160;

Computer-Controlled Technology . Nearly all new vehicles are factory&#8209;equipped with computer&#8209;controlled engine management systems to monitor and control ignition, emissions, fuel injection, transmission and certain mechanical systems. The on&#8209;board computers monitor inputs from many types of sensors located throughout the vehicle, and control a myriad of valves, solenoids, coils, switches and motors to manage engine and vehicle performance. Computer-controlled engine management systems enable the engine to operate with improved fuel efficiency and reduced levels of hazardous emissions.

Government emissions laws have been implemented throughout the majority of the United States. The Clean Air Act imposes strict emissions control test standards on existing and new vehicles, and remains the preeminent legislation in the area of vehicle emissions. As many states have implemented required inspection/maintenance tests, the Environmental Protection Agency, through its rulemaking ability, has also encouraged both manufacturers and drivers to reduce vehicle emissions. Automobiles must now comply with emissions standards from the time they were manufactured and, in most states, until the last day they are in use. This law and other government emissions laws have had, and we expect it to continue to have, a positive impact on sales of our ignition and emissions control parts since vehicles failing these laws may require repairs utilizing parts sold by us.

Our sales of sensors, valves, solenoids and related parts have increased as automobile manufacturers equip their cars with more complex engine management systems.

Wire and Cable Products . Wire and cable parts accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales in 2015, 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2014 and 11% of our consolidated net sales in 2013. These products include ignition (spark plug) wires, wire harnesses, battery cables and a wide range of electrical wire, terminals, connectors and tools for servicing an automobile&#8217;s electrical system.

We have historically offered ignition wires and battery cables under premium brands, which capitalize on the market&#8217;s awareness of the importance of quality, along with &#8220;value&#8221; priced brands for older vehicle applications. We extrude high voltage wire for use in our ignition wire sets. The vertical integration of this critical component offers us the ability to achieve lower costs and a controlled source of supply and quality.

Temperature Control Segment

We manufacture, remanufacture and market a full line of replacement parts for automotive temperature control (air conditioning and heating) systems, engine cooling systems, power window accessories and windshield washer systems, primarily under our brand names of Four Seasons&#174;, Factory Air&#174;, EVERCO&#174;, ACi&#174;, Imperial&#174;, COMPRESSORWORKS&#174;, TORQFLO&#174; and Hayden&#174; and through co-labels and private labels such as NAPA Temp Products&#8482;, Cold Power&#174;, Driveworks TM , ToughOne TM and Murray&#174;. The major product groups sold by our Temperature Control Segment are new and remanufactured compressors, clutch assemblies, blower and radiator fan motors, filter dryers, evaporators, accumulators, hose assemblies, thermal expansion devices, heater valves, heater cores, AC service tools and chemicals, fan assemblies, fan clutches, oil coolers, window lift motors, window regulators and assemblies, and windshield washer pumps. Our temperature control products accounted for approximately 27% of our consolidated net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Our Temperature Control business continues to implement cost savings initiatives in response to offshore competitive price pressures. We have consolidated excess manufacturing facilities and have implemented a program to improve our manufacturing efficiencies. We are also continuing to improve our cost position through our global sourcing initiatives in low cost regions and by increasing our production of remanufactured and new compressors in our facility in Reynosa, Mexico.

Today&#8217;s vehicles are being produced with more complex AC systems that are designed to improve their efficiency and reduce their size. Our Temperature Control Segment continues to be a leader in providing superior training to service dealers who require access to up-to-date knowledge in proper maintenance and repair for changing technologies utilized in today&#8217;s vehicles. We believe that our training module (Diagnosing and Repairing the Top Automotive HVAC Problems) remains one of the most sought-after training clinics in the industry and among professional service dealers.

Sales and Distribution

In the traditional channel, we sell our products to warehouse distributors, who supply auto parts jobber stores. Jobbers in turn sell to professional technicians and to &#8220;do-it-yourselfers&#8221; who perform automotive repairs on their personal vehicles. In recent years, warehouse distributors have consolidated with other distributors, and an increasing number of distributors own their jobber stores or sell down channel to professional technicians. In the retail channel, customers buy directly from us and sell directly to professional technicians and &#8220;do-it-yourselfers&#8221; through their own stores. Retailers are also consolidating with other retailers and have begun to increase their efforts to sell to professional technicians adding additional competition in the &#8220;do-it-for-me,&#8221; or the professional technician segment of our industry.

As automotive parts grow more complex, &#8220;do-it-yourselfers&#8221; are less likely to service their own vehicles and may become more reliant on automotive dealerships and independent service dealer technicians. In addition to new car sales, automotive dealerships sell OE brand parts and service vehicles. The products available through the dealers are purchased through the original equipment service (&#8220;OES&#8221;) network. Traditionally, the parts manufacturers of OEMs have supplied a majority of the OES network. However, certain parts manufacturers have become independent and are no longer affiliated with OEMs. In addition, many Tier 1 OEM suppliers are disinterested in providing service parts requirements for up to 15 years after the OE model has gone out of production. As a result of these factors, there are additional opportunities for independent automotive aftermarket manufacturers like us to supply the OES network.

Our sales force is structured to meet the needs of our traditional and retail customers across the distribution channel, allowing us to provide value-added services that we believe are unmatched by our competitors. We also believe that our sales force is the premier direct sales force for our product lines due to our concentration of highly&#8209;qualified, well&#8209;trained sales personnel. We provide our sales personnel extensive instruction at our training facility in Irving, Texas and provide an extensive continuing education program that allows our sales force to stay current on troubleshooting and repair techniques. The continuing education courses along with monthly supplemental web-based training are an integral part of our sales force development strategy.

&#160;

In addition to training our sales personnel in the function and application of our products, we thoroughly train our sales personnel in proven sales techniques. Our traditional and retail customers, therefore, have come to depend on these sales personnel as a reliable source for technical information and to assist with sales to their customers (i.e., jobber stores, &#8220;do-it-yourselfers,&#8221; and professional technicians). In this manner, we direct a significant portion of our sales efforts to our customers&#8217; customers to generate demand for our products, and we believe that the structure of our sales force facilitates these efforts by enabling us to implement our sales and marketing programs uniformly throughout the distribution channel. One of the ways we generate this demand is by offering technician seminars, which teach over 60,000 technicians annually how to diagnose and repair vehicles equipped with complex systems related to our products. To help our sales personnel to be teachers and trainers, we focus our recruitment efforts on candidates who have technical backgrounds as well as strong sales experience.

We offer a variety of strategic customer discounts, allowances and incentives to increase customer purchases of our products. For example, we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discounted terms of the invoice, and we offer pricing discounts based on volume purchased from us and participation in our cost reduction initiatives. We also offer rebates and discounts to customers as advertising and sales force allowances, and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided. We believe these discounts, allowances and incentives are a common practice throughout the automotive aftermarket industry, and we intend to continue to offer them in response to competitive pressures and to strategically support the growth of all our products.

Customers

Our customer base is comprised largely of warehouse distributors, large retailers, OE/OES customers, other manufacturers and export customers. Our five largest individual customers, including members of a marketing group, accounted for approximately 68% of our consolidated net sales in 2015, 69% of our consolidated net sales in 2014 and 66% of our consolidated net sales in 2013. During 2015, O&#8217;Reilly Automotive, Inc., NAPA Auto Parts, Advance Auto Parts, Inc., and AutoZone, Inc. accounted for 19%, 19%, 17% and 11% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Net sales from each of the customers were reported in both our Engine Management and Temperature Control Segments.

&#160;

In January 2016, one of our customers filed a petition for bankruptcy. In connection with the bankruptcy filing, we evaluated our potential risk and exposure as related to our outstanding accounts receivable balance from the customer as of December 31, 2015, and estimated our anticipated recovery. As a result of our evaluation, we recorded a net $3.5 million pre-tax charge during the year ended December 31, 2015 to reduce our accounts receivable balance to our estimated recovery. The net $3.5 million pre-tax charge is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to monitor the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy in determining whether additional provisions may be necessary.

Competition

We are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of replacement parts for product lines in Engine Management and Temperature Control. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, product availability, value-added services, product coverage, order turn&#8209;around time, order fill rate, technical support and price. We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors primarily through:

&#183; a value&#8209;added, knowledgeable sales force; 

&#183; extensive product coverage in conjunction with market leading brands; 

&#183; rigorous product qualification standards to ensure that our parts meet or exceed exacting performance specifications; 

&#183; sophisticated parts cataloguing systems; 

&#183; inventory levels and logistical systems sufficient to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers; 

&#183; breadth of manufacturing capabilities; and 

&#183; award-winning marketing and sales support and technical training. 

&#160;

In the Engine Management business, we are one of the leading independent manufacturers and distributors in the United States. Our competitors include ACDelco, Delphi Automotive PLC, Denso Corporation, Continental AG, Hitachi, Ltd., Motorcraft, Robert Bosch GmbH, Visteon Corporation, NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd., General Cable Corporation, Dorman Products, Inc. and several privately-owned companies importing products from Asia.

Our Temperature Control business is one of the leading independent manufacturers and distributors of a full line of temperature control products in North America and other geographic areas. ACDelco, Delphi Automotive PLC, Denso Corporation, Motorcraft, Sanden International, Inc., Continental AG, and several privately-owned companies are some of our key competitors in this market.

The automotive aftermarket is highly competitive, and we face substantial competition in all markets that we serve. Our success in the marketplace continues to depend on our ability to offer competitive prices, improved products, superior value-added services and expanded offerings in competition with many other suppliers to the aftermarket. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, we face competition from automobile manufacturers who supply many of the replacement parts sold by us, although these manufacturers generally supply parts only for cars they produce through OE dealerships. 

Seasonality

Historically, our operating results have fluctuated by quarter, with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment. It is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest, specifically in the Temperature Control Segment of our business. In addition to this seasonality, the demand for our Temperature Control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories. For example, a cool summer, as we experienced in both 2014 and 2013, may lessen the demand for our Temperature Control products, while a warm summer, as we experienced in 2015, may increase such demand. As a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our Temperature Control products, our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build&#8209;up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received. During this period, our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility.

Working Capital Management

Automotive aftermarket companies have been under increasing pressure to provide broad SKU (stock keeping unit) coverage due to parts and brand proliferation. In response to this, we have made, and continue to make, changes to our inventory management system designed to reduce inventory requirements. We have a pack&#8209;to&#8209;order distribution system, which permits us to retain slow moving items in a bulk storage state until an order for a specific branded part is received. This system reduces the volume of a given part in inventory and reduces the labor requirements to package and repackage inventory. We also expanded our inventory management system to improve inventory deployment, enhance our collaboration with customers on forecasts and inventory assortments, and further integrate our supply chain both to customers and suppliers.

We face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns. Many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a 90-day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty, which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications and/or the result of installation error. In addition to warranty returns, we also permit our customers to return new, undamaged products to us within customer-specific limits (which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us) in the event that they have overstocked their inventories. In addition, the seasonality of our Temperature Control Segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns.

&#160;

In order to better control warranty and overstock return levels, we have in place procedures for authorized warranty returns, including for warranty returns which result from installation error, placed restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program to better estimate potential future product returns. In addition, with respect to our air conditioning compressors, which are our most significant customer product warranty returns, we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not provide acceptable proof that complete air conditioning system repair was performed in accordance with approved procedures.

Our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to our sales mix of Temperature Control products. Our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter, as the inventory build&#8209;up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received. These increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our revolving credit facility.

Suppliers

The principal raw materials purchased by us consist of brass, electronic components, fabricated copper (primarily in the form of magnet and insulated cable), steel magnets, laminations, tubes and shafts, stamped steel parts, copper wire, stainless steel coils and rods, aluminum coils, fittings, rods, cast aluminum parts, lead, steel roller bearings, rubber molding compound, thermo&#8209;set and thermo plastic molding powders, and chemicals. Additionally, we use components and cores (used parts) in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, diesel pumps, and turbo chargers.

We purchase materials in the U.S. and foreign open markets and have a limited number of supply agreements on key components. A number of prime suppliers make these materials available. In the case of cores for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, diesel pumps, and turbo chargers, we obtain them either from exchanges with customers who return cores subsequent to purchasing remanufactured parts or through direct purchases from a network of core brokers. In addition, we acquire certain materials by purchasing products that are resold into the market, particularly by OEM sources and other domestic and foreign suppliers.

We believe there is an adequate supply of primary raw materials and cores. In order to ensure a consistent, high quality and low cost supply of key components for each product line, we continue to develop our own sources. We are not dependent on any single commodity, however, there can be no assurance over the long term that increases in commodity prices will not materially affect our business or results of operations. In addition, in August 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted rules requiring us to provide disclosure regarding the use of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. Implementation of the disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of our products, and may impose additional costs on us associated with complying with the disclosure requirements.

Production and Engineering

We engineer, tool and manufacture many of the components used in the assembly of our products. We also perform our own plastic molding operations, stamping and machining operations, wire extrusion, automated electronics assembly and a wide variety of other processes. In the case of remanufactured components, we conduct our own teardown, diagnostics and rebuilding for air conditioning compressors, diesel injectors, and diesel pumps. We have found this level of vertical integration provides advantages in terms of cost, quality and availability. We intend to continue selective efforts toward further vertical integration to ensure a consistent quality and supply of low cost components. In addition, our strategy includes sourcing an increasing number of finished goods and component parts from low cost regions such as those in Asia.

&#160;

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 3,400 people, with 1,900 people in the United States and 1,500 people in Mexico, Canada, Poland, the U.K., Hong Kong and Taiwan. Of the 3,400 people employed, approximately 1,500 people are production employees. We operate primarily in non&#8209;union facilities and have binding labor agreements with employees at other unionized facilities. We have approximately 60 production employees in Edwardsville, Kansas who are covered by a contract with The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (&#8220;UAW&#8221;) that expires in April 2019. We expect to renew this agreement with the UAW upon mutually agreeable terms. We also have approximately 700 employees in Mexico who are covered under union agreements negotiated at various intervals.

We believe that our facilities are in favorable labor markets with ready access to adequate numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, and we believe our relations with our union and non&#8209;union employees are good.

Insurance

We maintain basic liability coverage up to $2 million for automobile liability, $10 million for general and product liability and $100 million for umbrella liability coverage. We also maintain environmental insurance of $10 million and property insurance of $210 million, including business interruption insurance, covering our existing U.S. and Canadian facilities. We are currently monitoring our environmental remediation efforts at one of our facilities. The environmental testing and any remediation costs at such facility may be covered by several insurance policies, although we can give no assurance that our insurance will cover any environmental remediation claims. Historically, we have not experienced casualty losses in any year in excess of our coverage. However, there can be no assurances that liability losses in the future will not exceed our coverage.
