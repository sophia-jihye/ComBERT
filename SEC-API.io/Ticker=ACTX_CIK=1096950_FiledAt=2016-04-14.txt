 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Through Distributors, we are in the business of designing, manufacturing, branding and selling proprietary plastic medical grade containers that can store pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids, some of which can grind solids and shred herbs. While some of our marketing to date has related to the use of these containers for marijuana-related purposes, we have received child safety certification for our 20-dram container and we are focusing our marketing efforts on drug stores and drug store chains, veterinarians and veterinary distributors and other distributors and end users. Through Printing, we are in the business of private labeling and branding for purchasers of containers and other products. For more detailed information as to our business and our plans to develop it, see &#8220;Description of Business.&#8221; Acology&#8217;s operating subsidiary, Distributors, which Acology acquired on March 28, 2014, commenced operations on January 29, 2013, and Printing commenced operations on April 14, 2015.

&#160;

The address of the Company is 1620 Commerce St., Corona, CA 92880 and its telephone number is (844) 226-5649.

&#160;

Our History 

&#160;

Acology was incorporated on September 9, 1997, in the State of Florida.

&#160;

On December 24 , 2013, Acology, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acology and Distributors entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger under which Distributors became the wholly owned subsidiary of Acology on March 4, 2014. Prior to the merger, Acology was a shell company. As a result of the Merger, Acology became an operating company. In connection with the Merger, Acology issued 3,846,000,000 shares of Common Stock to Curtis Fairbrother and Douglas Heldoorn, the holders of all of the membership units in Distributors, who thereby became Acology&#8217;s controlling shareholders, in exchange for those units. Upon the closing of the Merger, the existing officer and sole director of Acology resigned and Messrs. Fairbrother and Heldoorn became its officers and directors.

&#160;

Also in connection with the Merger:

&#160;

&#8226; On March 4, 2014, Acology completed a private placement with 3 investors of 700,000,000 shares of Common Stock for proceeds of $40,000 in cash. The price paid by each investor was $0.000571429 per share. Acology also entered into Registration Rights Agreements with these investors, under which Acology filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 covering the shares issued in the Private Placement, which was declared effective on August 6, 2014. For further information about the participation of a corporation owned by our president and sole director until March 4, 2014, in the Private Placement, see &#8220;Directors, Executive Officers, Promoters and Control Persons - Related Party Transactions &#8211; Private Placement.&#8221; &#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; Prior to the Merger, our president and sole director until March 4, 2014, entered into an Exchange Agreement with Acology, under which 35,000,000 shares of the Common Stock beneficially owned by him and $151,269 of Acology&#8217;s indebtedness to him were exchanged for the proceeds of the Private Placement and a secured convertible promissory note of Acology payable to him in the principal amount of $400,000 and bearing interest at the rate of 0.28% per annum; a prepayment if $40,000 was made on that date, leaving a balance of $360,000. The convertible promissory note matured on March 4, 2015, but its maturity date has been extended to September 14, 2016, is subject to acceleration in the event of certain events of default, contains certain restrictive covenants and is secured by a pledge of all of the units of Distributors. The unpaid principal amount of the convertible promissory note and the interest accrued thereon is convertible as a whole or in part from time to time into an indeterminate number of shares of Common Stock at a conversion price per share equal to 50% of the average of the daily closing prices for a share of Common Stock for the 3 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the day on which the convertible promissory note is delivered for conversion. For further information respecting the convertible promissory note, certain risks associated with it and the pledge, see &#8220;Directors, Executive Officers and Control Persons &#8211; Related Parties &#8211; Exchange Transaction.&#8221; &#8226; On January 9, 2014, the articles of incorporation were amended (i) to change our corporate name to Acology, Inc., (ii) to increase the number of the authorized shares of common stock to 6,000,000,000 and (iii) to reverse split the common stock on the basis of 1 new share for 1,000 existing shares. The reverse stock split was applicable to shares held by shareholders of record on February 14, 2014, and was implemented on that date. &#160; 

As a result of the Merger, we are in the business of designing, manufacturing, branding and selling proprietary plastic medical grade containers that can store, and grind and shred, pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids. For more detailed information as to our business and our plans to develop it, see &#8220;Description of Business.&#8221;

&#160;

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Introduction 

&#160;

Acology is the parent of Distributors and Printing. Acology has no material assets other than all of the outstanding membership units of Distributors and the membership units of Printing and has no plans to conduct any business activities other than obtaining or guaranteeing financing for the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries or assisting them in obtaining such financing.

&#160;

Through Distributors and Printing, we are in the business of designing, manufacturing, and selling containers that can store, grind and shred pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids. Our principal product is the Medtainer&#174;, which is described below under &#8220;Products.&#8221; Through Printing, we are in the business or custom labeling our products and products manufactured by others.

&#160;

We market directly to businesses through our phone room, to the retail public through internet sales and, and to wholesalers and other businesses who resell our products to other businesses and end users. See &#8220;Description of Business &#8211; Sales and Distribution.&#8221;

&#160;

As indicated above, our products can store and grind many substances. Our products are manufactured using medical-grade resin because we intended to market them for use in grinding pills for administration to children and other persons who have difficulty swallowing and to pets. Our 20-dram Medtainer&#174; has received child safety certification.

&#160;

In light of the facts that the possession and use of marijuana have been legalized, subject to varying restrictions, in many states and that several other states are considering such legalization, we believe that our products may be of interest to a large number of users of marijuana in and we advertise our products on our website and elsewhere as suitable for that purpose. However, since we do not seek information from our customers who are end users as to how they intend to utilize our products and have no similar knowledge respecting end users of products sold through our distributor, we are unable to determine the extent of its use in connection with the storage and grinding of marijuana or any other purpose. We believe that marketing our products to users of marijuana subject us to the following risks.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; The use of marijuana for medical and recreational use is lawful in many states, but under United States federal law and the laws of the other states, the possession, use, cultivation, storage, processing and/or transfer of marijuana is illegal. Federal and state law enforcement authorities have prosecuted persons engaged in these activities. While we do not believe that we engage in any of these activities, any of these law enforcement authorities might bring an action against us in connection with the engagement of others in them, including, but not limited, to a claim of aiding and abetting their criminal activities. Such an action would have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations. &#8226; Under United States federal law, it is unlawful to sell or offer for sale, to use the mails or any other facility of interstate commerce to transport or to import or export drug paraphernalia. The term &#8220;drug paraphernalia&#8221; includes any equipment, product or material of any kind which is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, concealing, producing, processing, preparing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance. One of the factors that these authorities may consider in determining whether our products are drug paraphernalia are our national and local advertising concerning its use and we have advertised our products as usable for marijuana-related purposes. However, we do not believe that our products were designed or are intended for any of these purposes or that our products are drug paraphernalia, as defined in federal law, and we are promoting our products primarily to be used for other purposes. If federal authorities were to take a different view, they might bring a criminal action against us. Such an action would have a material and adverse effect on our business and operations. &#160;

Products 

&#160;

The Medtainer&#174; stores herbs and herbal remedies, medicines, coffee and teas, wines and liquors, foods and other solids and liquids without cross-contamination. Some configurations have a built-in grinder in order that non-liquids that it carries may be ground into powder in the case of medicines or shredded in the case of herbs. The Medtainer&#174; is manufactured from medical-grade polypropylene resin, is air- and water-tight, non-porous and non-leaching. We currently sell the Medtainer&#174; in a 20-dram child resistant version and our 20-dram original version, a 20 dram non-child resistant version and a 40 non-child resistant version. Medtainer&#174;. We plan to sell the Medtainer&#174; in several other configurations. We sell our products with and without logos and other markings.

&#160;

As indicated by the picture below, the Medtainer&#174; with a grinder/shredder has three components. The top component is a cap, the middle component is a storage cup with grinding/shredding teeth projecting downward from its bottom and the bottom component is a grinding/shredding cup with teeth projecting upward from its bottom. Material is transferred from the storage cup into the grinding/shredding cup, the storage cup is inserted into the grinding/shredding cup, forming a space in which the two sets of teeth intermesh, and the two cups are then rotated manually such that the material passes between the two sets of teeth and is ground or shredded. The ground or shredded material may then be returned to the storage cup for storage or used or dispensed in another manner. The cap attaches to the grinding/shredding cup such that the storage cup is held between them, forming a compact unit which is air- and water-tight between the cap and the storage cup, as well as between the storage cup and the bottom cup.

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160; 

Medtainers&#174; without grinding capacity will have only a cap and a storage container.

&#160;

In the future, we may sell containers other than the Medtainer&#174; that will give consumers the ability to easily store, carry and consume various solids and liquids.

&#160;

We have acquired an inventory of cigarette lighters and &#8220;smellproof&#8221; bags, but have not determined when or how we will market them.

&#160;

Source of Products 

&#160;

We do not manufacture, and for the foreseeable future do not plan to manufacture, our products. We acquire our products from Polymation Medical Products, LLC (&#8220;Polymation&#8221;), a pharmaceutical container manufacturer located in Newbury Park, California, under an agreement that we entered into with Polymation on August 13, 2013, under which we purchase all of our Medtainers&#174;. The agreement has an initial term of 10 years and is extendible for a like term by mutual consent. Under this agreement, we have the exclusive worldwide right to purchase, promote, advertise, market, distribute and resell the Medtainer&#174;, which respect to which the owner of Polymation holds a patent. The agreement requires minimum purchases (see the following paragraphs), sets prices for the products that we purchase, subject to increase because of changes in the local consumer-price index and increases in Polymation&#8217;s cost of materials, rent and utilities. Polymation is currently unable to meet our requirement of 45,000 units per month because it does not have sufficient production capacity to meet it. Polymation is now 19,420 units short of the units that we have ordered, for which we have prepaid $10,683, and is in default under our agreement with it. We are discussing with Polymation ways in which it can meet our needs for its products.

&#160;

Under the agreement with Polymation, we were initially required to purchase at least 30,000 units per month, with that requirement increasing by 10% on each anniversary of the effective date of the agreement. We are now required to purchase at least 33,000 units per month.

&#160;

Also, under this agreement, (i) we assigned the registered trademark &#8220;Medtainer&#8221; to Polymation, (ii) we received an exclusive license to use that trademark, (iii) we received a right of first refusal to acquire Polymation&#8217;s business on the same terms offered by a bona fide, arm&#8217;s-length, third-party buyer with a 50% discount from the price offered by such buyer, and (iv) we agreed that, in the event that Distributors (or its successor, assignee or affiliate) were to form a new corporation for the purpose of selling the products that we acquire under the agreement, Distributors would cause such corporation issue to the owner of Polymation one percent of such corporation&#8217;s authorized preferred and voting shares.

&#160;

We presently have no other suppliers, but may seek them out in connection with the manufacture of containers other than Medtainers&#174;.

&#160;

Sales and Distribution 

&#160;

As indicated above, we sell approximately 99% of our products to wholesalers and distributors, who resell them to businesses and consumers, both in unmarked and custom-labeled form, and the remainder directly to retail consumers through internet sales. In 2014, we sold approximately 123,000 units and during 2015, we sold approximately 314,000 units. During the first quarter of 2016, we sold approximately 100,000 units. We currently have approximately 111,000 units in inventory.

&#160;

We have entered into a Product License and Distribution Agreement, dated April 1, 2014, with IGreen Planet Store, Ltd. (&#8220;IGreen&#8221;), a Canadian distribution company located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Under this agreement, we have granted to IGreen an exclusive license to market, sell and distribute the Medtainer&#174; in Canada. The agreement has a 5-year term. We are required to maintain product liability insurance covering the products sold under the agreement. We are in the process of obtaining such insurance. IGreen is not required to purchase a minimum quantity of our products. The agreement is subject to yearly reviews by the parties in respect of price, quantities ordered and other matters. Based upon these reviews, the parties may modify, amend or revoke the agreement.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

We entered into an oral agreement, on September 30, 2013, with TSD Worldwide (&#8220;TSD&#8221;), a distribution company located in Santa Fe Springs, California. Under this agreement, as amended in writing on November 18, 2013, TSD acted as our exclusive U.S. seller of designated products, except that we retained the right to sell products over our website. TSD failed to meet sales goals and we terminated the agreement with TSD in June 2014.

&#160;

In mid-2014, our sales staff presently comprised our two officers. We now have 13 sales personnel, including our two officers, who make sales in our phone room and over our website.

&#160;

We also have a presence on Facebook, Twitter and other social media. We believe that social media are important to our marketing program for our products.

&#160;

Printing 

&#160;

Printing commenced operations on April 15, 2015, and is in the early stage of its development, accounting for less than 1% of our sales. We formed it because some of our customers desired to have custom labels imprinted on the products that they purchased from us and we found that the cost of doing so through third parties raised the price that we charged to customers for imprinted product to levels that we believed would impede sales. Printing is performed using specialized printers. We currently have one printer and have ordered another. We are also seeking business from businesses that require labelling on their own products.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our Medtainer&#174; is covered by a patent held by Polymation. As we develop our own products, we may rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, unpatented know-how, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our proprietary rights. We believe that the patent owned by Polymation is material to our business, but we cannot presently ascertain the extent to which intellectual property that we may develop or license will be important to us.

&#160;

We employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, to protect our trade secrets and know-how. We have licensed a patent that we own to Polymation and may license in the future, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from third parties.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We believe that the Medtainer&#174; is a unique product and that there is presently no product that competes with it. However, even though it is patented, we cannot assure that a product that can store and grind substances without conflicting with this patent cannot be developed. In addition, we face intense competition in the sale of our products and compete with multiple companies principally on the basis of price, service, quality, product characteristics and the ability to supply products to customers in a timely manner. Our products also compete with metal, glass, paper and other packaging materials as well as plastic and resin packaging materials made through different manufacturing processes. Most of our existing and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and their products may enjoy greater initial market acceptance among our potential customers. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution, service and other resources than we have and may also be better able to adapt quickly to customers&#8217; changing demands and changes in technology, to enhance existing products, to develop and introduce new products and new production technologies and to respond timely changing market conditions and customer demands. If we are not able to compete successfully in the face of our competitors&#8217; advantages, our ability to gain market share or market acceptance for the products that we sell could be limited, our revenues and our profit margins could suffer, and we may never become profitable.

&#160;

While we believe that the patent under which our Medtainer&#174; is manufactured (see &#8220;Description of Business &#8211; Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property&#8221;) may afford us some protection from competition by similar products, no assurance can be given that a competing product cannot be developed without infringing our patent.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by the uniqueness of our products, by building a reputation for high-quality products and innovation and by maintaining strong relationships with our distributors and, where possible, their and our customers.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

The Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) regulates the material content of our products, including the medical-grade polypropylene resin used in the manufacture of the Medtainer&#174;, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the &#8220;CPSC&#8221;) regulates certain aspects of our products pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall these products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which we sell or intend to sell our products. In addition, certain state laws restrict the sale of packaging with certain levels of heavy metals and impose fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although FDA-approved resins and pigments are used in our products that directly contact food and drugs and we believe our products are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements (although we are not required to submit them to either the FDA or the CPSC for review), we are remain subject to the risk that our products could be found not to be in compliance with these and/or other requirements. A recall of any of our products or any fines and penalties imposed in connection with noncompliance could have a materially adverse effect on us.

&#160;

We are not required to submit the Medtainer&#174; for review by either agency.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

In mid-2014, we had 2 employees, namely, the Company&#8217;s two officers. We now have, in addition to these officers, 11 sales personnel and 4 administrative personnel.

&#160;
