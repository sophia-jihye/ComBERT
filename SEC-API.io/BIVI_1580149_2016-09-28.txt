 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS &#160;

Introduction 

&#160;

BioVie, Inc. (F/K/A NanoAntibiotics, Inc., the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a development stage enterprise that was incorporated in the state of Nevada on April 10, 2013. The Company is engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of a therapy targeting ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Ascites due to liver cirrhosis is a life-threatening condition affecting about 100,000 Americans and many times more worldwide. Our therapy BIV201 is based on a drug that is approved in about 50 countries to treat related complications of liver cirrhosis (part of the same disease pathway as ascites), but not yet available in the US. BIV201&#8217;s active agent is a potent vasoconstrictor and has shown efficacy for reducing portal hypertension in studies around the world. The goal is for BIV201 to interrupt the ascites disease pathway, thereby halting the cycle of accelerating fluid generation in ascites patients. The BIV201 development program began at LAT Pharma LLC. On April 11, 2016, the Company acquired LAT Pharma LLC and the rights to its BIV201 development program. We are currently completing the work necessary to file our investigational new drug (IND) application, and aim to commence clinical trials should the FDA approve our application.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the company&#8217;s business plan. 

&#160;

About Ascites and Liver Cirrhosis 

&#160; 

About 1 million Americans and millions worldwide suffer from liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death due to disease in the US, killing an estimated 27,000 people each year. The condition results primarily from hepatitis, alcoholism, and fatty liver disease linked to obesity. Ascites is a common complication of advanced liver cirrhosis, involving kidney dysfunction and the accumulation of large amounts of fluid in the abdominal cavity.

&#160;

The Needs for an Ascites Therapy 

&#160; 

With no medications approved by the FDA specifically for treating ascites, an estimated 40% of patients die within two years of diagnosis. Certain drugs approved for other uses such as diuretics may provide initial relief, but patients may fail to respond to treatment as ascites worsens. This represents a critical unmet medical need. US treatment costs for liver cirrhosis, including ascites and other complications, are estimated at more than $4 billion annually.

&#160;

The Ascites Development Pathway 

&#160; 

&#160;-1-

&#160;

Most experts agree that ascites develops through a sequence of events illustrated by the above diagram. High blood pressure in the vein that supplies blood to the liver, called &#8220;portal hypertension,&#8221; occurs as increasing liver damage (fibrosis) impedes blood flow through the liver. This causes vasodilation and blood pooling in the central or &#8220;splanchnic&#8221; region of the body and low blood volume in the arteries. The decrease in effective blood volume activates a signaling pathway (&#8220;neurohormonal systems&#8221;) which tells the kidneys to retain large amounts of salt and water in an effort to increase blood volume. Ultimately the retention of excess sodium and water leads to the formation of ascites as these substances &#8220;weep&#8221; from the liver and lymph system and collect in the patient&#8217;s abdomen.

&#160;

The BIV201 Mechanism of Action 

&#160;

BIV201 is being developed by BioVie with the goal of alleviating the portal hypertension and correcting splanchnic vasodilation, thereby increasing effective blood volume and reducing the signals to the kidneys to retain excess salt and water. If successful, BIV201 could halt the cycle of accelerating fluid generation in ascites patients and reduce the need for the frequent and painful paracentesis procedures many of these patients currently require

&#160;

Future Possible BIV201 Indications 

&#160; 

Based on investigative studies around the world, BIV201 has the potential for future applications in other life-threatening conditions due to liver cirrhosis, such as those listed below. Securing marketing approvals for any of these new uses will require well-controlled clinical trials to satisfy the FDA and/or other countries&#8217; regulatory requirements, none of which have commenced at this time. The Company may be unable to, or chose not to, pursue the development BIV201 for these indications.

&#160;

&#183; Esophageal variceal bleed (EVB): The bursting of blood vessels lining the esophagus due to high blood pressure (&#8220;portal hypertension&#8221;) in the vein which supplies blood to the liver resulting as a result of advanced liver cirrhosis. This situation requires emergency treatment to avoid blood loss and death. &#160;

&#183; Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): As their disease progresses liver cirrhosis patients&#8217; kidneys may begin to fail, and this deadly condition may set in. It often occurs once a patient no longer responds to (off-label) drugs used to control ascites. The second stage is called &#8220;type 1 HRS&#8221; and requires hospitalization as multiple organ failure and death may occur. &#160;

&#183; Hyponatremia: This term refers to &#8220;low salt in the bloodstream,&#8221; another dangerous condition which can occur as a result of advanced liver cirrhosis. &#160;

Joint Venture and Possible Access to Early-Stage Compounds 

&#160; 

The Company has an Agreement with PharmaIN Corporation (Bothell, WA) providing certain limited rights and information on their program to develop novel modified terlipressin compounds. Although at an early stage, these compounds hold the promise of simpler and potentially safer dosing for patients outside the hospital. If this program makes significant advances, BioVie may contact PharmaIN to explore a licensing opportunity.

&#160;

The Company and PharmaIN have exchanged small (low single-digit) ownership rights to each other&#8217;s ascites drug development programs, and may work together to advance both of them to eventual product commercialization.

&#160;

Efflux Pump Antibiotics Program 

&#160; 

Prior to the Merger the Company was exclusively developing novel nanotechnology anti-infective drugs to combat multi-drug resistant bacteria. We are at an early stage of discovery and development of broad spectrum antibiotics for gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections. Developing this technology in-house is resource-intensive with respect to time, personnel and capital necessary for scientific discovery. For further development of our nanoantibiotic technology we will need to find and license additional nanotechnology to complete our planned products. Presently this program is inactive as we are focusing our efforts on BIV201. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

BioVie relies on a combination of trade secrecy and patent strategy to protect our confidential information and seek market exclusivity for our products. The Company has submitted patent filings for BIV201 technology in the US and Japan as well as submitted a PCT in Europe. Additionally, BioVie has applied for US Orphan Drug Designation for its new drug candidate since the estimated number of ascites patients (about 100,000 Americans) meets the required patient population size.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company spent $37,901 in research and development activities.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any pharmaceutical candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed in foreign countries.

&#160;

United States Drug Development Process 

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and related regulations, and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biological products include, among other things, viruses, therapeutic serums, vaccines and most protein products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#160;-3-

&#160;

&#8226; Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations; &#8226; Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#8226; Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s current good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biologic for its intended use; &#8226; Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or an NDA, for a new drug product, or a Biologics License Application, or a BLA, for a new biological product; &#8226; Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is to be produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practice standards, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s or biologic&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; &#8226; Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and &#8226; FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. &#160;

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. There can be no certainty that approvals will be granted.

&#160;

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug or biological candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug or biological candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug or biological candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot assure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial.

&#160;

&#160;-4-

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug or biological candidate to healthy volunteers or patients having the disease being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s good clinical practices requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed.

&#160;

Human clinical trials prior to approval are typically conducted in three sequential Phases that may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#8226; Phase 1. The drug or biologic is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients having the specific disease.

&#160;

&#8226; Phase 2. The drug or biologic is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease.

&#160;

&#8226; Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials, which usually involve more subjects than earlier trials, are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.

&#160;

Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.

&#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA by the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

&#160;

&#160;-5-

&#160;

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug or biological candidate and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug or biologic. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug or biological candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

&#160;

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

&#160;

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug or biologic, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.

&#160;

The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA or BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA.

&#160;

After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, purity and potency. In addition to its own review, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biologic. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required.

&#160;

Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.

&#160;

&#160;-6-

&#160;

The NDA or BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA will issue a &#8220;complete response&#8221; letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

&#160;

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

&#160;

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our drug or biological candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in the European Union.

&#160;

Expedited Development and Review Programs 

&#160;

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.

&#160;

&#160;-7-

&#160;

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing approval, including those submitted to a Fast Track program, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared with marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to establish safety and efficacy for the approved indication. Failure to conduct such studies, or conducting such studies that do not establish the required safety and efficacy may result in revocation of the original approval. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch or subsequent marketing of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

&#160;

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160;

Any drug or biological products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information on an annual basis or as required more frequently for specific events, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs and biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug&#8217;s or biologic&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including the immediate discontinuation of noncomplying materials, adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs and biologics for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.

&#160;

We will need to rely, on third parties for the production of our product candidates. Manufacturers of our product candidates are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of comprehensive records and documentation. Drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are also required to register their establishments and list any products made there with the FDA and comply with related requirements in certain states, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a &#8220;consent decree,&#8221; which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, and possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

&#160;

&#160;-8-

&#160;

The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of the product.
