Business Overview 

&#160; 

Our Company produces pop culture and live multimedia conventions (&#8220;Comic Conventions&#8221;) across North America that provide a social networking and entertainment venue for popular fiction enthusiasts of movies, TV shows, video games, technology, toys, social networking/gaming platforms, comic books, and graphic novels. These Comic Conventions provide venues to entertainment companies, toy companies, gaming companies, publishing companies, and retailers for their sales, marketing, promotions, public relations, advertising and sponsorships efforts. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Conventions has been producing comic conventions since July 1997.

&#160; 

We receive revenue from our Comic Conventions in three (3) ways, namely from (i) consumer admissions; (ii) exhibitor booth sales; and (iii) national and/or regional sponsorships. Each Comic Convention varies in cost to produce. Production costs vary based on the size and scope of the production. Generally, our production costs range from approximately $350,000 for a smaller scale production to over $2,500,000 for a larger production. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s plan for 2016 is to focus the Wizard World tour on the following shows: (i) Portland, OR; (ii) New Orleans, LA; (iii) Cleveland, OH; (iv) Las Vegas, NV; (v) St. Louis, MO; (vi) Madison, WI; (vii) New York, NY; (viii) Minneapolis, MN; (ix) Philadelphia, PA (2 events); (x) Des Moines, IA; (xi) Sacramento, CA; (xii) Richmond, VA; (xiii) Columbus, OH; (xiv) Pittsburgh, PA; (xv) Chicago, IL; (xvi) Austin, TX; (xvii) Tulsa, OK; and (xviii) Wizard World Cruise on the Norwegian Sky from Miami to Nassau, Bahamas. 

&#160; 

Our target audience includes both men and women aged 18-55, and families of all ages who are active consumers of many types of entertainment and media, such as movies, music, toys, video games, apps, consumer electronics, computers, and lifestyle products (e.g. clothes, footwear, digital devices, and mobile phones). 

&#160; 

CONtv 

&#160; 

CONtv is a new digital network devoted to passionate fans of pop culture entertainment as it will provide consumers access to thousands of hours of exclusive content showcasing an original slate of programming as well as a vast digital catalog of over 1,200 must-watch titles, including, but not limited to, original series, cult television shows and genre movies encompassing sci-fi, horror, fantasy, anime, grindhouse, martial arts action, and more, to live coverage of events at the cons&#8211; all available on-demand either in a free, ad-supported format or a low cost, subscription-based model of $6.99/month for premium content. CONtv is a partnership with Cinedigm, one the nation&#8217;s largest independent distributor of digital entertainment. 

&#160; 

CONtv, is a multi-platform OTT service geared toward the Comic Convention community, and is available to consumers as of March 2015. The digital service will bring fans their favorite films, television series, comics, behind the scenes access to the Conventions and more. CONtv will be offered as a free ad-supported platform as well as a subscription which will include content exclusives, audience rewards, a dynamic social viewing experiences, and ticketing bundle opportunities for fans planning to attend the Conventions. CONtv will be providing over 1600 hours of programming available across a wide spectrum of devices including Roku, Apple iOS, Android, Xbox, Samsung, Smart TV, mobile, and tablet devices. 

&#160; 

ConBox 

&#160; 

In April 2015, the Company through its subsidiary, Wiz Wizard, launched ComicConBox (&#8220;ConBox&#8221;). ConBox is a subscription-based premium monthly box service featuring collectibles, exclusives, toys, tech and gaming, licensed artwork, superior comics and apparel, Comic Convention admissions, special VIP discounts and more, which will be shipped on or around the end of every month. The Company plans to continue to partner with major Comic Convention related brands and celebrities to deliver a high quality and variation of products directly to the front doors of its subscribers.

&#160; 

Digital Media 

&#160; 

We produce a number of digital media properties, including our website www.wizardworld.com , emails, newsletters, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr and Tumblr to create awareness of our Comic Conventions and provide updates to our fans and consumers. To a large extent we also use our website www.wizardworld.com to provide a source for the latest Wizard World news and information. While there is little or no direct revenue derived from these properties, the indirect benefit supports sales functions of all the events (dealer and exhibitor booths, admissions, sponsorships), as well as helping us secure additional, more sought after, and higher profile talent. This in turn, helps additional admissions, booth sales and sponsorships.

&#160; 

The Company maintains an email list consisting of all our current and active users. This is a primary driver of information dissemination, along with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. YouTube is mainly used as brand awareness, as information is posted after an event, which helps to generate excitement at future events. Because we are a tour, this is essential to creating excitement for all our cities, not just a single event. 

&#160; 

With Facebook, all of our attending artists and celebrities are given unique links announcing their involvement in our events. This helps generate excitement among their existing fan base (and ours) and can create a sense of community and groundswell of support for the show. Once we establish a critical mass of people, the shows can become part of the fabric of the community where people anticipate the event months and sometimes even a full year in advance. This retention is essential to our sales process. Procuring new and timely talent helps generate new customers, as well as the word of mouth of previous attendees. Much of this is achieved via email, Facebook, Twitter, and www.wizardworld.com .

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Unlike many live events (sports, concerts, etc.), where attendees are spectators (even if they are a part of a community at large), at our events the attendees are participants in the events. This atmosphere creates a greater amount of user generated content for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. For instance, we always notice an uptick among Facebook &#8220;Likes&#8221; in profile pic changes on Facebook the days during and after our events featuring the celebrities and Photo Ops from our events. This is a non-paid form of free advertising. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are a perfect marriage for these types of event photos. 

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160; 

Our objective is to use our Comic Conventions and Wizard World Digital, Inc. (&#8220;Digital&#8221;) to become the voice for pop culture enthusiasts across multiple media platforms. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; producing high quality live multimedia events across North America for promotion of consumer products and entertainment; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; leveraging the content created and generated at the live multimedia events to enter the media market and distribute the content in digital media such as websites, apps, emails, newsletters, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Tumblr, Instagram and YouTube, among others; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; obtaining sponsorships and promotions from media and entertainment companies for the Comic Conventions, including: &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; expanding our relationships with entertainment and media companies; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; forming strategic relationships with new media and entertainment companies to promote their products. &#160; 

In addition, the Company plans to produce a live music concert series with well-known emerging and known artists at many of its Comic Conventions. Admissions to the concerts will be sold separately from the admission to the Comic Convention. 

&#160; 

We receive revenue from our Comic Conventions in three (3) ways, namely from (i) consumer admissions; (ii) exhibitor booth sales; and (iii) national and/or regional sponsorships. Our business plan is to generate additional revenues from advertising sales on all of Digital&#8217;s media properties. We began realizing revenue from our digital properties during the fourth quarter of 2011. We expect that digital media revenues will primarily be earned through offering advertisers the ability to place banner ads on our digital media properties, priced on a standard cost-per-thousand (&#8220;CPM&#8221;) basis. 

&#160; 

Sponsorships and Advertising 

&#160; 

We sell sponsorship and advertising opportunities to businesses seeking to reach our core target audience of active entertainment consumers, with a particular focus on men and women aged 18 to 55 and young families. 

&#160; 

Sponsorships 

&#160; 

We provide sponsorship opportunities that allow advertisers a wide range of promotional vehicles on-site and through our public relations efforts. For example, we offer advertisers the ability to (i) display signage at the Comic Conventions, (ii) include their desired logos on all direct mail that is sent in connection with one or more Comic Conventions, (iii) be included in press releases to the media, (iv) obtain sponsor tags on the radio spots or in the print or online ads where we advertise, and (v) obtain advertising space in our digital media. We also provide the opportunity for advertisers to sponsor events at the Comic Conventions like costume contests or gaming tournaments and the ability to have &#8220;step-and-repeats&#8221; for photo opportunities, meet and greets with celebrities, VIP packages, and &#8220;goody&#8221; bag giveaways. Sponsors pay a fee based upon the position of their advertising media and the exposure it will receive. Specifically, the closer a sponsor is to the entrance of the Comic Convention, the more exposure such sponsor will receive as a greater number of Comic Convention attendees will view the sponsor&#8217;s product and/or services. Therefore, the rental fee for space at our Comic Conventions is more expensive if the space is closer to the entrance. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Promotions 

&#160; 

Promotional opportunities include product placement and brand associations on-site at the Comic Conventions. As our brand grows, we hope to earn revenues by co-promoting, for example, a movie at one of our Comic Conventions, with entertainment and media companies and brands seeking to benefit from the popularity of the Comic Conventions and the exposure received from appearing at them. We have not and do not enter into formal agreements with respect to co-promotion with other parties. 

&#160; 

Digital Media 

&#160; 

We produce a number of digital media properties, including our website www.wizardworld.com , emails, newsletters, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, Instagram, and Tumblr to create awareness of our Comic Conventions and provide updates to our fans and consumers. To a large extent we also use our website www.wizardworld.com to provide a source for the latest Comic Convention news and information. Display advertising is offered to brand advertisers across all our digital media properties, priced on a traditional CPM basis. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our Comic Conventions are marketed through a variety of media outlets, including social media, websites, public relations, television, radio, direct mail, email, flyers, and postcards. Our Comic Conventions usually obtain publicity through coverage of the events at our Comic Conventions from local TV stations, radio stations, newspapers, national press such as the Associated Press and Reuters, fan websites, blogs, and social network channels such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and Tumblr. In certain instances, we do not pay for advertising because we can provide desirable content to media outlets. For example, we typically invite the local TV stations to our Comic Conventions so that they can interview the celebrities featured at our Comic Conventions. As a result, we receive free TV coverage and the TV stations obtain content for their shows. In addition, we arrange for celebrities to call into local radio stations. As a result, we receive on-air promotion of our events and the radio station reaches a larger audience who want to tune in to hear our celebrities. We also receive on-air promotion by exchanging air time for admission giveaways to our Comic Conventions. With respect to the internet and online advertising, we advertise throughout our website www.wizardworld.com about the upcoming Comic Conventions. We also send out emails to our fans on a regular basis. In addition, we send out direct mail postcards, print flyers and postcards in each city where we hold a Comic Convention, which are handed out at local events, retailers and public gatherings. As a result, we believe that we are cost effective when it comes to how we spend our advertising dollars. 

&#160; 

We are consistently creating and developing new content to distribute to our fans via all of the digital outlets we have developed. 

&#160; 

Trademarks and Copyrights 

&#160; 

We have a portfolio of trademarks and service marks and maintain a catalog of copyrighted works. Such marks include Wizard World, Where Pop FI Comes to Life and Wizard World Girls. We do not consider our service marks and trademarks to be significant to our business. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Typically, we do not have to obtain permits to operate the Comic Conventions. The convention centers at which such events occur obtain any required permits and cover fire safety and occupancy matters as part of the rental agreement. Crowd control varies by location and is either provided by the convention center&#8217;s personnel or by a third party security service recommended by the convention center. The convention centers do, however, require liability insurance, which Conventions has obtained and maintained. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

Our client base is diverse. We have access to some of what we consider to be the leading movie studios, video game producers, comic book publishers, television broadcasters, and toy manufacturers. These customers are potential exhibitors and sponsors of our Comic Conventions. In addition, our digital media business will provide sales opportunities across the Fortune 1000 corporate sector, as these brand advertisers look to leverage our media properties to target our age 18-55 and all families target audience. 

&#160; 

No single advertiser, promoter or sponsor comprises a significant portion of our revenues. 

&#160; 

Competition; Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

In the live, regionally-based consumer conventions market, the strength of a competitor is measured by the location and size of the region or city, the frequency of live events per year, the guest and VIP list (e.g. celebrities and artists), the number of paying attendees, the physical size of the convention, the extent of the public relations outreach (through traditional media, digital media and social media), and the quantity and quality of exhibitors and dealers. We believe that we have a strong competitive position because our Comic Conventions take place in well-known major cities in North America throughout the year. Our multiple conventions per year enable us to market our events year round, create a large amount of content that can be distributed through our digital media outlets, and market in not only the regional consumer areas, but nationally as well. The multiple locations also allow us to work with more celebrities, artists and writers and host them in multiple cities. 

&#160; 

There are a number of Comic Convention providers that produce events across the country. We are unique in that we produce more events annually than any other organization. We reach coast-to-coast, north-to-south markets in the United States. We believe that creates an advantage over other event producers because our Comic Conventions are not limited to one city, but rather to several well-known cities across North America. 

&#160; 

We also believe that we have an edge over competitors because our Comic Conventions are well known and well respected in the Comic Convention and pop culture world. We have a reputation among fans, exhibitors, and celebrities for producing high-quality and well attended events. 

&#160; 

Sales Channels and Pricing Policies 

&#160; 

We have outsourced our admission sales to an online admission service, thereby eliminating the need to mail physical badges. Consumers can order online, print out their barcoded receipt, come to the show, have the receipt scanned and receive a wristband for entry. In addition, consumers may have the barcode scanned on his or her cell phone at the show and receive a wristband for entry. The Company also sells wristbands on-site at the live events themselves. We offer a five dollar discount on the purchase price of our admission to those who pre-purchase online as compared to those who purchase on-site at the Comic Convention. Admission typically ranges from $35 for a single day pass to $95 for a general weekend pass. Entry of children ten years old and under is free at all Comic Conventions. 

&#160; 

Across all our digital media properties, display advertising is offered to brand advertisers, priced on a traditional CPM basis. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

&#160; 

We promote our Comic Conventions through a wide variety of media outlets, such as local radio and TV stations, newspapers, fan websites, and blogs. We also use online social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Flickr, and Tumblr, to reach our fans and provide updates. Further, we promote our Comic Conventions on our website www.wizardworld.com and through our email database. We currently sell to prospective corporate sponsors and advertisers through our direct sales force. In 2013, we augmented our direct sales force through the utilization of third party representation firms and digital ad networks to help sell display advertising on our digital properties. We plan to continue to do so.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

We plan to organically develop new Comic Conventions and increase the revenues of our existing Comic Conventions by adding more dealers, exhibitors, celebrities, panels, gaming tournaments, and VIPs to our Comic Conventions. Additionally, we are focused on increasing revenues through increasing corporate sponsorships with national Fortune 500 marketers by allowing these advertisers a wide range of promotional vehicles, both on-site and through our digital media and online offerings. We believe that we will be able to further maximize our relationships with our existing dealers, exhibitors, celebrities, and VIPs while, at the same time, developing new relationships with national brand marketers looking to connect with our growing audiences. 

&#160; 

The Wizard World Comic Convention digital marketing platform extends across online and social media outlets with a growth strategy that is fueled by continually producing content for and harnessing content from the growing Comic Convention consumers. For example, the platform includes: (i) the websites www.wizardworld.com and www.wizardworlddigital.com , (ii) our Facebook page, www.facebook.com/wizardworld , (iii) Twitter at www.twitter.com/wizardworld , (iv) video social websites such as www.youtube.com/wizardworld , and (v) Instagram at www.instagram.com/wizardworld . Across the various outlets, the Company covers new and upcoming products and talents in the pop culture world, in order to distribute the large amount of content we create from our live events. Through the distribution of our content via digital media, we offer advertisers the ability to display their sponsorship messages in immersive and integrated ways, including, but not limited to, our large e-mail database of fans. Through sales of everything from digital display advertising space on our digital media properties, to title sponsorship positioning on key aspects for the live events, we plan to generate new forms of sponsorship revenues and thus strengthen our financial condition.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have forty-two full-time equivalent employees. Additionally, we engage three freelance consultants to operate our Comic Convention business.
