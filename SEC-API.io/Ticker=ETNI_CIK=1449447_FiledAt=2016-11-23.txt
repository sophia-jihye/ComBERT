 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 24, 2008 as JB Clothing Corporation. Until July 10, 2009, our principal business objective was the offering of active/leisure fashion design clothing. 

&#160; 

On July 10, 2009 we abandoned our efforts in the field of active/leisure fashion design clothing when we acquired 100% of the share capital of Entest BioMedical, Inc., a California corporation, (&#8220;Entest CA&#8221;) from Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. (&#8220;BMSN&#8221;) for consideration consisting of 10,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company and the cancellation of 10,000,000 shares of the Company owned and held by Mr. Rick Plote. 

&#160; 

As a result of this transaction, the former stockholder of Entest CA held approximately 70% of the voting capital stock of the Company immediately after the transaction. For financial accounting purposes, this acquisition was a reverse acquisition of the Company by Entest CA under the purchase method of accounting, and was treated as a recapitalization with Entest CA as the acquirer. As of November 1, 2011 the former stockholder of Entest CA held approximately 48% of the outstanding common shares of the Company. 

&#160; 

Upon acquisition of Entest CA, we abandoned our efforts in the field of active/leisure fashion design clothing. Our business is currently the business of Entest CA, and we currently intend to develop and commercialize therapies, medical devices and medical testing procedures. On July 12, 2009 we adopted the name of Entest CA when we changed our name to Entest BioMedical, Inc. 

&#160; 

On June 18, 2015 Entest established Zander Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. 

&#160; 

On June 23, 2015 Regen Biopharma, Inc. ( &#8220;Regen&#8221;) entered into an Regen Agreement (&#8220;Regen Agreement&#8221;) with Zander Therapeutics, Inc. ( &#8220;Zander&#8221;) whereby Regen granted to Zander an exclusive worldwide right and license for the development and commercialization of certain intellectual property controlled by Regen (&#8220; License IP&#8221;) for non-human veterinary therapeutic use for a term of fifteen years. Zander is a wholly owned subsidiary of Entest Biomedical, Inc. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Regen Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of one hundred thousand US dollars ($100,000) as a license initiation fee which must be paid within 90 days of June 23, 2015 and an annual non-refundable payment of one hundred thousand US dollars ($100,000) on July 15 th , 2016 and each subsequent anniversary of the effective date of the Regen Agreement. 

&#160; 

The abovementioned payments may be made, at Zander&#8217;s discretion, in cash or newly issued common stock of Zander or in common stock of Entest BioMedical Inc. valued as of the lowest closing price on the principal exchange upon which said common stock trades publicly within the 14 trading days prior to issuance. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Regen Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen royalties equal to four percent (4%) of the Net Sales , as such term is defined in the Regen Agreement, of any Licensed Products, as such term is defined in the Regen Agreement, in a Quarter. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Regen Agreement, Zander will pay Regen ten percent (10%) of all consideration (in the case of in-kind consideration, at fair market value as monetary consideration) received by Zander from sublicensees ( excluding royalties from sublicensees based on Net Sales of any Licensed Products for which Regen receives payment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Regen Agreement). 

&#160; 

Zander is obligated pay to Regen minimum annual royalties of ten thousand US dollars ($10,000) payable per year on each anniversary of the Effective Date of this Regen Agreement, commencing on the second anniversary of June 23, 2015. This minimum annual royalty is only payable to the extent that royalty payments made during the preceding 12-month period do not exceed ten thousand US dollars ($10,000). 

&#160; 

The Regen Agreement may be terminated by Regen: 

&#160; 

If Zander has not sold any Licensed Product by ten years of the effective date of the Regen Agreement or Zander has not sold any Licensed Product for any twelve (12) month period after Zander&#8217;s first commercial sale of a Licensed Product. 

&#160; 

The Regen Agreement may be terminated by Zander with regard to any of the License IP if by five years from the date of execution of the Regen Agreement a patent has not been granted by the United States patent and Trademark Office to Regen with regard to that License IP. 

&#160; 

The Regen Agreement may be terminated by Zander with regard to any of the License IP if a patent that has been granted by the United States patent and Trademark Office to Regen with regard to that License IP is terminated. 

&#160; 

The Regen Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On September 28, 2015 Zander caused to be issued to Regen 8,000,000 of the common shares of Entest Biomedical, Inc in satisfaction of one hundred thousand US dollars ($100,000) to be paid to Regen by Zander as a license initiation fee. 

&#160; 

On September 8, 2016 Zander paid $17,000 to Regen as a partial payment of the July 15th, 2016 liability 

&#160; 

David R. Koos serves as sole officer and director of both Zander and Entest. and also serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Regen. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s current strategy is to develop and commercialize therapies, medical devices and medical testing procedures for the veterinary market. It is believed by the Company that any required regulatory approvals can be obtained much more rapidly with regard to products and services developed for the veterinary market and that the achievement of successful clinical trials and commercialization of such products and services may allow the company to enter into collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies for the purpose of developing and commercializing these products and services for human usage. 

&#160; 

The process by which a new drug is approved for use in humans within the United States generally begins prior to submission of the IND (Investigational New Drug Application) with the FDA. 

&#160; 

Prior to submission of the IND, the sponsor of the drug compound under development must test the drugs on laboratory animals (preclinical testing) in order that toxicity may be determined and efficacy may be demonstrated. The results of such preclinical testing is crucial in determining whether or not the sponsor may proceed onto clinical trials on human beings and preclinical testing is required to be performed on multiple species. 

&#160; 

Drug studies in humans can begin only after an IND is reviewed by the FDA and a local institutional review board (IRB). The board is a panel of scientists and non-scientists in hospitals and research institutions that oversees clinical research. 

&#160; 

IRBs approve the clinical trial protocols, which describe the type of people who may participate in the clinical trial, the schedule of tests and procedures, the medications and dosages to be studied, the length of the study, the study's objectives, and other details. IRBs make sure the study is acceptable, that participants have given consent and are fully informed of their risks, and that researchers take appropriate steps to protect patients from harm. 

&#160; 

After trial protocols have been approved the sponsor moves on to Phase I clinical trials (to determine safety and toxicity in a small number of volunteers) and, if Phase 1 studies don't reveal unacceptable toxicity, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials to determine effectiveness. 

The process by which a new drug is approved for veterinary use within the United States generally begins with the sponsor researching and developing the new compound and conducting initial (&#8220;pilot&#8221;) studies on it for a specific use in a specific animal species (called the &#8220;target animal&#8221; species) If the results of the pilot studies are promising and there is a potential market for the drug, the drug sponsor contacts The US Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) to officially begin the drug approval process by opening an Investigational New Animal Drug (&#8220;INAD&#8221;) file. Information is submitted regarding Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls; Effectiveness; Target Animal Safety; Human Food Safety(if applicable); Environmental Impact (if applicable) and Labeling in support of the NADA (New Animal Drug Application) which is submitted by the sponsor for approval by the FDA. 

&#160; 

With the exception of a biologic product which can be classified as a medical device, Biologics developed for human use generally are undergo the same path to FDA approval as for drugs. Biologics classified as medical devices may, in most instance, be subject to premarket approval by the FDA. Medical devices intended for veterinary use are not subject to premarket approval by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Veterinary Biologics are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) which is authorized, under the 1913 Virus-Serum-Toxin Act as amended by the 1985 Food Security Act, to ensure that all veterinary biologics produced in, or imported into, the United States are not worthless, contaminated, dangerous, or harmful. The Veterinary Biologics Program of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) oversees the veterinary biologics industry in the United States. 

&#160; 

Domestic manufacturers of veterinary biologics, for domestic use or for export, are required to possess a valid U.S. Veterinary Biologics Establishment License and an individual U.S. Veterinary Biologics Product License for each product produced for sale. Prior to being granted a U.S. Veterinary Biologic Establishment License, the applicant must submit detailed information regarding the facilities and the qualifications of key personnel and must submit to an inspection of the facilities by the Center for Veterinary Biologics, a division of the USDA . To qualify for an establishment license, an applicant also must qualify for at least one product license. 

&#160; 

Prior to being granted a U.S. Veterinary Biologics Product License, the applicant must submit detailed information including test reports and research data sufficient to establish purity, safety, potency and efficacy of the product, an Outline of Production, and information regarding labeling and facilities that are to be used in preparation. 

&#160; 

It is the Company&#8217;s opinion that factors such as the lack of need for multispecies pre clinical testing, smaller subject size in efficacy testing (subjects generally in the hundreds for veterinary equivalent of Phase III clinical trials as opposed to generally in the thousands for Phase III clinical trials for drug compounds for use in humans), lack of the requirement for premarket approval for medical devices intended for veterinary use should generally lead to a shorter timeframe for approval by the appropriate regulators of drugs, biologics, and medical devices intended for veterinary use as opposed to drugs, biologics, and medical devices intended for human use. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company is currently focusing its efforts and allocating its resources towards: 

&#160; 

(a) The development and commercialization of ImenVax&#8482;, a therapeutic cancer vaccine for use in canines (b) The the development and commercialization of certain intellectual property for non-human veterinary therapeutic use licensed to Zander pursuant to the Regen Agreement. The Company has not undertaken any discussions with any pharmaceutical companies regarding the commercialization of any products under development. None of the Company&#8217;s products have been approved by any regulatory body for marketing within the United States or anywhere else. No assurance can be given that all or any of the Company&#8217;s currently planned products will ever be commercialized.

Principal Products and Services 

&#160; 

The Company is currently focusing its research and development efforts toward the successful development and commercialization of the ImenVax family of canine cancer vaccines as well as the development and commercialization of certain intellectual property for non-human veterinary therapeutic use licensed to Zander pursuant to the Regen Agreement 

&#160; 

ImenVax&#8482; I 

&#160; 

ImenVax&#8482; I, currently under development by the Company, is a therapeutic for canine cancer which involves isolating tumor cells from the patient and then placing the cells into a cell implant device that is inserted subcutaneously into the patient. The resulting expression of tumor antigens from the device is intended to generate an anti-tumor immune response. The implant chamber device provokes immune responses to the tumor cells isolated from the patient&#8217;s own tumor through a process known as indirect presentation. Tumor cells implanted in the device are exposed to conditions that are distinct from the tumor&#8217;s environment from which they were isolated. This altered environment allows for anti-tumor responses that are not ordinarily observed in the natural tumor progression. 

&#160; 

The cells are : 

&#160; 

1) Isolated from the tumor and freed from the natural tumor microenvironment 

2) Subjected to an initial ischemic condition of hypoxia that induces increased antigen expression 

3) Allowed to repopulate within the device in a context that facilitates extended release of tumor antigens. 

&#160; 

The device utilized is comprised of a 0.4 micron inner membrane to retain the implanted cells and an 

outer 5 micron membrane that allows blood vessels to form on the surface to enhance biocompatibility. The outer membrane is held in place by a polyester mesh. The membranes are sonically sealed using a polyester mesh insert. 

&#160; 

The device contains a surface architecture that promotes vascularization in-vivo. There is an initial ischemic phase that may additionally influence the tumor cell growth characteristics and genetic regulation of the tumor cells. 

&#160; 

It is hypothesized that shortly after implantation, the expression of immunosuppressive molecules is down regulated while the release of antigens is maintained, thus allowing immune responses to occur that would normally be suppressed. 

&#160; 

The Antigens that are released from the implanted device are taken up by antigen presenting cells (APC). 

It is believed that the APCs will be trained to recognize the cancer cells and alert the body&#8217;s immune response, activating antibodies and T cells to destroy the tumor cells. 

&#160; 

The Company is currently conducting a ten dog safety study to Evaluate ImenVax&#8482; I for the Treatment of Canine Oral Melanoma and determine adverse effects, if any. As of May 17, 2012 three dogs suffering from oral melanoma have been administered the therapy with no dog suffering any material adverse reaction. 

&#160; 

Inclusion in the Safety Study is limited to ten dogs with histologically confirmed canine oral melanoma with a Studied Karnofsky performance status of one or less. The subject are required to be over eight kg with measurable tumor lesions by caliper or imaging, either primary or metastatic, that may or may not have had prior non-immunological-based therapy. No concurrent NSAID therapy is allowed and previous use of immune-based therapies is not permitted. Subjects are required to have a two month life expectancy, and, not have any disease or condition (other than the cancer) that would preclude living for 3 to 6 months. 

&#160; 

Toxicity is evaluated prior to, and after, treatment and monthly for a period of 3 months. To date, 3 dogs have been enrolled in the safety study with none exhibiting any adverse effects. The Company estimates that an additional $100,000 will be required to be expended to complete the safety study. 

&#160; 

ImenVax &#8482; II 

&#160; 

Also in early stage development by the Company is a version of ImenVax &#8482; called ImenVax &#8482; II which utilizes cell lines for sustained release of immunologically relevant cytokines for maximum anti-tumor immune responses. It is believed by the Company that this controlled release of cytokines will act as an adjuvant to be combined with patient&#8217;s tumor cells (antigens) within an implantable membrane encapsulation device. 

&#160; 

ImenVax &#8482; II is designed to function in a manner similar to ImenVax&#8482; I. However, In order to further potentiate the tumor antigen specific immune responses, the Company intends to include adjuvant cytokine(s) along with tumor cells into the implantation device. The adjuvants can be added through cytokine expressing cell line. The implantation device to be utilized for administering ImenVax &#8482; II is expected to be substantially similar to that utilized in administering ImenVax&#8482; I. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ImenVax &#8482; III 

&#160; 

ImenVax III is intended to function by harnessing the ability of placental extracts to combat canine cancers. ImenVax&#8482;III is intended to treat existing tumors through stimulation of immune responses to: 

&#160; 

a) kill tumor cells directly; 

b) indirectly kill tumor cells by cutting off the tumor blood supply; and 

c) block the ability of the tumor to suppress the immune system. 

&#160; 

Xenogeneic (from different species) antigen induced immunity has been shown to break self tolerance and capable of engendering immune responses against the endogenous counterpart self - antigen. The use of xenogeneic placental derived agents such as VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) has demonstrated regression of soft tissue sarcomas in dogs (Kamstock D, Elmslie R, Thamm D, Dow S. 2007. Evaluation of a xenogeneic VEGF vaccine in dogs with soft tissue sarcoma. 56(8): 1299 - 309). 

&#160; 

ImenVax &#8482; III is intended to be an off the shelf formulation, manufactured under GMP, which shall harness the power of trophoblasts (cells forming the outer layer of a blastocyst, which provide nutrients to the embryo and develop into a large part of the placenta) derived from human placental tissue to combat canine cancers . No tissue processing is required for the administration of the ImenVax &#8482; III therapy as opposed to I and II as no cellular material from the patient is utilized. 

&#160; 

ENT-576 &#8482; 

&#160; 

ENT-576 &#8482; is a proprietary therapy being developed by the Company for the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) such therapy comprising of: 

&#160; 

a) extracting a therapeutic number of cells from a tissue containing in part a stem cell population; 

b) processing said population of cells derived from said tissue so as to concentrate said stem cell population; 

c) systemic re-administration of said cell population into the same patient; and 

d) exposing the patient lung to a sufficient intensity and frequency of laser irradiation necessary to augment therapeutic activity of said cells in said patient suffering from COPD. The Company has also considered utilizing an FDA approved biochemical drug to produce the desired augmentation of therapeutic activity. 

&#160; 

A therapeutic intervention in COPD would require addressing the issues of inflammation and regeneration. Although approaches such as administration of bone marrow stem cells or fat derived cellular components have both regenerative and anti-inflammatory activity in animal models, the Company feels that the need to enhance their potency for clinical applications can be addressed through the usage of low level lasers which studies have demonstrated may induce growth factor production, inhibit inflammation and stimulate angiogenesis. 

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that approvals required will be obtained for any of the Company&#8217;s current therapies under development, or that if such approvals are obtained that the Company will be able to effectively market its therapies. There can be no assurance given that actual costs and timeframes related to commercialization for any proposed product will not deviate materially from the Company&#8217;s estimation. Currently, none of the Company&#8217;s products under development may be administered or marketed in the United States or outside of the United states except pursuant to an exemption from relevant regulation. The Company does not anticipate conducting further research and development related to ENT-576&#8482; until completion of the Safety Study due to limited resources available to the Company. 

&#160; 

On October 19, 2011 the Company entered into an agreement with RenovoCyte LLC and Medistem Inc. (&#8220;Agreement&#8221;) whereby the Company shall provide research services to RenovoCyte LLC in connection with a ten dog pilot study to determine the safety and effectiveness of the utilization of stem cell therapy for the treatment of arthritis in animals (&#8220;Pilot Study&#8221;). The term of the Agreement is from October 19, 2011 until the earlier of the completion of the Pilot Study or October 19, 2015 unless terminated by RenovoCyte LLC due to an event of force majeure exceeding a period of 4 months. As consideration for providing services pursuant to the Agreement, the Company shall enjoy joint publishing rights with regards to the results of the Pilot Study. Canine mesenchymal multipotent stem cell injections to be utilized during the course of the Pilot Study shall be provided to the Company by RenovoCyte LLC at no cost to the Company. 

&#160; 

As of November 15, 2016 there have been 8 canine patients treated through the Pilot Study.
