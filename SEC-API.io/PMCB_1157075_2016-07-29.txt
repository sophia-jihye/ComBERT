 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

We are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing and preparing to commercialize treatments for cancer and diabetes based upon a proprietary cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology known as &#8220;Cell-in-a-Box &#174; .&#8221; Our unique Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology will be used as a platform upon which treatments for several types of cancer, including advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer, and diabetes will be developed.

&#160;

We are developing therapies for pancreatic and other solid cancerous tumors involving the encapsulation of live cells placed in the body to enable the delivery of cancer-killing drugs at the source of the cancer. We are also developing a therapy for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes based upon the encapsulation of a human cell line genetically engineered to produce, store and secrete insulin at levels in proportion to the levels of blood sugar in the human body using our Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology. In addition, we are examining ways to exploit the benefits of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology to develop therapies for cancer based upon the constituents of the Cannabis plant, known as &#8220;cannabinoids.&#8221;

&#160;

Cancer Therapy

&#160;

Targeted Chemotherapy 

&#160;

We are using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology to develop a therapy for solid cancerous tumors through targeted chemotherapy. For example, for pancreatic cancer we encapsulate genetically engineered live human cells that produce an enzyme designed to convert the prodrug ifosfamide into its cancer-killing form. The capsules containing these cells will be implanted in a patient in the blood supply as near as possible to the tumor. The cancer prodrug ifosfamide will then be given intravenously at one-third the normal dose. In this way, the ifosfamide will be converted at the site of the tumor instead of in the liver where it is normally converted. We believe placement of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; capsules near the tumor enables the production of optimal concentrations of the &#8220;cancer-killing&#8221; form of ifosfamide at the site of the tumor. The cancer-killing metabolite of ifosfamide has a short half-life, which we believe will result in little to no collateral damage to other organs in the body. In an earlier Phase 1/2 clinical trial which used ifosfamide at one-third the normal dose with the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology, this targeted chemotherapy not only reduced the tumor size but also generally resulted in no obvious adverse side effects attributed to this therapy.

Pancreatic Cancer 

&#160;

Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. It is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. It has been predicted that this cancer will become the second leading cause of cancer deaths by 2020. The five-year survival rate is 8%, reportedly the lowest survival rate of any cancer. It is expected that in 2016 there will be approximately 53,000 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. and approximately 90,000 new cases diagnosed in Europe. Unfortunately, about 71% of patients will die within the first year of diagnosis. More than 90% will die within two years of diagnosis. Patients have a three and one-half month median life expectance after diagnosis without treatment.

&#160;

The problem is that patients with pancreatic cancer are not normally diagnosed until the cancer is advanced and inoperable. There is no cure unless the cancer is surgically removed in its earliest stages. Since the first drug (gemcitabine) was approved in the U.S. for pancreatic cancer in 1996, approximately 40 Phase 3 clinical trials have been conducted in an attempt to improve upon the anticancer activity of gemcitabine. Despite these efforts, little improvement in median survival time and percentage of one-year survivors has occurred since 1996. Most of the limited success achieved has been seen when gemcitabine is given in combination with another cancer chemotherapy drug.

&#160;

The current standard of care for advanced pancreatic cancer is the combination of Abraxane &#174; (nab-paclitaxel) plus gemcitabine. This combination was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) in September 2013. This combination increased the median survival time by 1.8 months, as compared to gemcitabine alone. It increased the one-year survival time from 22% with gemcitabine alone to 38% with Abraxane &#174; plus gemcitabine. There are severe side effects from this combination chemotherapy.

&#160;

Our Pancreatic Cancer Therapy 

&#160;

We are developing a therapy for pancreatic cancer to address a critical unmet medical need. This need exists for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer whose tumors are locally advanced, non-metastatic and inoperable but no longer respond to Abraxane &#174; plus gemcitabine.

&#160;

Although several therapies have been tried in this situation, the most commonly used is believed to be the combination of the cancer chemotherapy drug capecitabine plus radiation (&#8220;CRT&#8221;). However, the results of a Phase 3 clinical trial were recently reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. This clinical trial addressed whether CRT is more effective than chemotherapy alone. In patients with locally advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer whose tumors no longer responded to gemcitabine or gemcitabine plus erlotinib (standard initial therapies at the time the clinical trial was conducted) patients were treated with the same chemotherapy or with CRT. In both cases CRT was not meaningfully more effective than chemotherapy alone. Consequently, these patients have no known effective treatment alternative once their tumors no longer respond to this combination therapy.

&#160;

Subject to FDA approval, we plan to commence a Phase 2b clinical trial later this year. The trial is designed to show that our Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus low-dose ifosfamide therapy can serve as an effective and safe consolidation chemotherapy for patients whose tumors no longer respond after four to six months of therapy with Abraxane &#174; plus gemcitabine. The trial will take place in the U.S. with study sites in Europe. Translational Drug Development (&#8220;TD2&#8221;) will conduct the trial in the U.S. Clinical Network Services (&#8220;CNS&#8221;) will conduct the trial in Europe in alliance with TD2. TD2 will be responsible for clinical development plans, program analysis, medical writing, clinical management and database development.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The trial will be two-armed and randomized. Patients will be randomized equally into two treatment arms to receive our therapy or gemcitabine alone. Only patients whose tumors are locally advanced, inoperable and non-metastatic will be eligible to be enrolled. Patients must have been treated with Abraxane &#174; plus gemcitabine for four to six months and their tumors must no longer respond to this therapy. Each patient who will receive our therapy will receive a single implantation of 300 Cell-in-a-Box &#174; capsules plus multiple courses of low-dose ifosfamide until they receive no further benefit from this therapy. In two earlier clinical trials using our same therapy discussed below, only two courses of ifosfamide were given.

&#160;

The primary endpoints, or outcomes being measured, of the trial are progression-free survival assessed after 26 and 52 weeks, as well as safety and tolerability of the comparative therapies. The secondary endpoints include: (i) overall survival at 14, 26 and 52 weeks; (ii) objective response rate at 14, 26 and 52 weeks as measured by CT and PET scans; (iii) assessment of a patient&#8217;s tumor going from inoperable to operable after 14, 26 and 52 weeks; (iv) time to onset of pain and pain management after 14, 26 and 52 weeks; and (v) assessment of the patients&#8217; overall quality-of-life while undergoing our therapy.

&#160;

Malignant Ascites Fluid Therapy 

&#160;

We are also developing a therapy to delay the production and accumulation of malignant ascites fluid that results from all abdominal tumors. Malignant ascites fluid is secreted by abdominal tumors into the abdomen after the tumor reaches a certain stage of growth. This fluid contains cancer cells that can seed and form new tumors throughout the abdomen. This fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity, causing swelling of the abdomen, severe breathing difficulties and extreme pain.

&#160;

Malignant ascites fluid must be surgically removed on a periodic basis. This is painful and costly. There is no available therapy that prevents or delays the production and accumulation of malignant ascites fluid. We have been involved in a series of preclinical studies at TD2 to determine if the combination of Cell-in-a-Box &#174; encapsulated cells plus ifosfamide can delay the production and accumulation of malignant ascites fluid from abdominal cancers. If successful, we plan to conduct a clinical trial in the U.S. with additional study sites in Europe. TD2 will conduct the trial in the U.S., and CNS will conduct the trial in Europe in alliance with TD2. We plan to start a clinical trial in 2017 if the results of our preclinical studies support the trial and we receive FDA approval to do so.

&#160;

Diabetes Therapy

&#160;

Diabetes Epidemic 

&#160;

Diabetes is one of the largest health problems in the world. In its 2016 Global Report on Diabetes, the World Health Organization (&#8220;WHO&#8221;) has estimated that 422 million people worldwide have the disease &#8211; 314 million more than in 1980. Approximately 8.5% of adults worldwide have diabetes. Approximately $920 billion is spent annually in the treatment of diabetes and related healthcare. Over 20% of healthcare dollars in the U.S. are estimated to be spent on care for people with diagnosed diabetes. Up to 29.1 million people in the U.S. have diabetes. Approximately $615 million was spent annually in treatment of diabetes alone. The worldwide market for diabetes treatments alone has been projected to reach $650 billion by 2020.

&#160;

Diabetes 

&#160;

Diabetes is caused by insufficient availability of, or resistance to, insulin. Insulin is produced by the islet cells of the pancreas. Its function is to assist in the transport of sugar (glucose) in the blood to the inside of most types of cells in the body where it is used as a source of energy for those cells. In Type 1 diabetes the islet cells of the pancreas (the body&#8217;s insulin-producing cells) have been destroyed - usually by an autoimmune reaction. Type 1 diabetics require daily insulin administration through injection or through the use of an insulin pump. In Type 2 diabetes the body does not use insulin properly. This means the body has become resistant to insulin. Type 2 diabetes can generally be controlled by diet and exercise in its early stages. As time goes by, it may be necessary to use antidiabetic drugs to control the disease. However, over time these too may lose their effectiveness. Thus, even Type 2 diabetics may become insulin-dependent.

&#160;

&#160;

Efforts to Cure for Diabetes 

&#160;

In an effort to &#8220;cure&#8221; Type 1 diabetes, replacement of damaged pancreatic beta islet cells has been attempted. This involves transplantation of the entire pancreas or of its beta islet insulin-producing cells. In 2000, islet cells from human cadavers were transplanted into insulin-dependent diabetics in a clinical trial. In this clinical trial involving seven patients in Edmonton, Canada, each patient enrolled remained insulin-independent for one year. But because of the high doses of immune-suppressive drugs that must accompany such transplantations (to avoid rejection of the transplanted islet cells), patients were placed at high risk of infection and even cancer. The administration of these immunosuppressive drugs was necessary throughout the remaining lifespan of the patients in the trial. Unfortunately, these drugs are not only expensive but are associated with serious side effects that have required patients to cease treatment with them. In addition, patients who by necessity are given high doses of immunosuppressive drugs are open to opportunistic infections for as long as they are immunosuppressed. Worldwide, less than 1,000 people with Type 1 diabetes are known to have been transplanted with pancreatic islets from another human.

&#160;

In an effort to avoid the use of islet cells from human donors, encapsulated islet cells from pigs have been used. This type of interspecies transplantation is known as xenotransplantation. Drug regulatory authorities have been resistant to approving the use of such interspecies transplantations. In addition, there are problems besides regulatory approval, the foremost of which is an attack by the body&#8217;s immune system on the transplanted cells. To protect the non-human cells from attack by the immune system of the human being, they have been encapsulated using other forms of encapsulation technology than we use. In those studies, the transplanted islet cells from pigs were surrounded by a porous capsule, typically made of alginate (a derivative of seaweed).

&#160;

Efforts to translate this concept into a viable treatment for Type 1 diabetes have been plagued by poor survival of the transplanted islet cells. In addition, the integrity of capsules composed of alginate has been shown to degrade over time. This then allows for immune system attack on the transplanted pig islets and necessitates additional transplantations. Moreover, as the alginate &#8220;capsules&#8221; degrade, they themselves can elicit an immune response.

&#160;

Different tubular and planar &#8220;chamber-type&#8221; immune-protective devices that contain islet cells are under development. Such devices are placed in the body where they can be retrieved and replaced when necessary. Tubular chambers have shown good biocompatibility, but they are subject to rupture, exposing the islets to immune system attack. They also require large numbers of islets cells. Planar chambers are more stable, but they can cause extensive foreign body reactions in the host resulting in fibrotic overgrowth and thus transplant failure.

&#160;

The most extensively researched immune-protective strategy is that which employs micro-capsules. They are relatively simple to manufacture, can be implanted into the body without major surgery and, depending on the nature of the encapsulation material, micro-encapsulated cells can be cryopreserved. Micro-encapsulated islet cells first made their appearance in 1994 when a diabetic patient, already receiving immunosuppressive drugs, was transplanted with these cells encapsulated in alginate and remained insulin-independent for 9 months. However, 22 years and numerous clinical trials later, there are still no reports of long-term insulin-independence in non-immune-suppressed diabetic patients receiving encapsulated pancreatic islet transplants.

&#160;

Our Bio-Artificial Pancreas for Diabetes 

&#160;

We plan to develop a therapy for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes that is unique among available therapies for this disease. We are developing a therapy that involves encapsulation of human liver cells that have been genetically engineered to produce, store insulin and release insulin on demand at levels in proportion to the levels of blood sugar (glucose) in the human body. The encapsulation will be done using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology.

&#160;

In October 2014, we obtained from the University of Technology Sydney (&#8220;UTS&#8221;) in Australia an exclusive, worldwide license (&#8220;Melligen Cell License Agreement&#8221;) to use insulin-producing genetically engineered human cells developed by UTS to treat Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. These cells, named &#8220;Melligen,&#8221; have already been tested in mice and shown to produce insulin in direct proportion to the amount of glucose in their surroundings. In fact, when Melligen cells were transplanted into immunosuppressed diabetic mice, the blood glucose levels of the mice became normal. In other words, the Melligen cells reversed the diabetic condition.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Austrianova Singapore Pte Ltd (&#8220;Austrianova&#8221;) has already successfully encapsulated live pig pancreatic islet insulin-producing cells using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology and then implanted these encapsulated cells in grossly diabetic rats. Soon after the capsules were implanted, the rats&#8217; blood glucose levels normalized and remained normal throughout the study period of approximately six months. No immune system suppressing drugs were needed. Thus, the preclinical proof of principle for a bio-artificial pancreas has already been established using Cell-in-a-Box &#174; capsules containing pig pancreatic insulin-producing cells in a rat model of Type 1 diabetes.

&#160;

Melligen cells can be readily grown in culture and hence are available in unlimited supply. Compared to native pancreatic beta islet cells, Melligen cells are much more resistant to the pro-inflammatory cytokines that have been shown to be involved in beta islet cell death. We believe that this property makes them the ideal candidate cell line for beta islet cell replacement therapy with the prospect to achieve long-term transplant graft function.

&#160;

In June 2013, we acquired from Austrianova an exclusive, worldwide license to use the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology for the development of a treatment for diabetes and the use of Austrianova&#8217;s Cell-in-a-Box &#174; trademark and its associated technology (&#8220;Diabetes Licensing Agreement&#8221;).

We believe that encapsulating the Melligen cells using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology has numerous advantages over encapsulation of cells with other materials, such as alginate. Since they are composed largely of cellulose (a bio-inert material in the human body), the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; capsules are exceedingly robust. This allows them to remain intact for long periods of time in the body, all the while protecting the cells inside them from immune system attack. Moreover, in prior studies, these capsules and the cells inside them have not caused any immune or inflammatory responses like those seen with alginate-encapsulated cells.

&#160;

We believe that the combination of the Melligen cells and the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; encapsulation technology could lead to a break-through therapy for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. Encapsulating the Melligen cells could enable us to overcome all of the past &#8220;problems&#8221; in developing a true bio-artificial pancreas.

&#160;

International Diabetes Consortium 

&#160;

We have established an international Diabetes Consortium (&#8220;Consortium&#8221;). The Consortium consists of world-renowned physicians and scientists from several countries around the globe, all of whom share the same goal of developing a therapy for Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes.

&#160;

In addition to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Scientific Officer, the Consortium is made up of well-known physicians and scientists from leading Universities in Munich, Germany, Mannheim, Germany, Vienna, Austria, Barcelona, Spain, Copenhagen, Denmark and Sydney, Australia. It also includes members from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, the Vorarlberg Institute for Vascular Investigation and Treatment (&#8220;VIVIT&#8221;) in Feldkirch, Austria and Austrianova in Singapore.

&#160;

Dr. Eva Maria Brandtner, Head of the Bioencapsulation Unit at VIVIT, leads the Consortium and is our Director of Diabetes Program Development. Dr. Brandtner, who provides consulting services to us through our agreement with her employer, previously served as the Chief Scientist with Austrianova. In that role she conducted preclinical studies with the Melligen cells.

&#160;

Cannabis Therapy

&#160;

With 25 states and the District of Columbia approving the use of marijuana for medical purposes as of June 2016, a plethora of medical marijuana companies have emerged. Most of these involve the production and distribution of Cannabis in its various forms, such as liquid extracts and pills, as well as Cannabis delivery systems - such as vapor pens. We are one of the few who are focused on using constituents of Cannabis for the treatment of specific diseases.

&#160;

Our major competitors for the development of Cannabis -based treatments for cancer are Cannabis Science, Inc. (&#8220;CSI&#8221;) and GW Pharmaceuticals, Plc. (&#8220;GWP&#8221;). CSI plans to use complex extracts of Cannabis to develop treatments for basal and squamous cell carcinomas and Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma. GWP is developing a product portfolio of cannabinoid-based prescription medicines.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In contrast to the work being done by these companies, we plan to use Cannabis to develop therapies for two of the deadliest forms of cancer &#8211; brain and pancreatic. We also plan to focus initially on developing specific therapies based on carefully chosen molecules rather than using complex Cannabis extracts. Targeted cannabinoid-based chemotherapy utilizing our Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology offers a &#8220;green&#8221; approach to treating solid-tumor malignancies.

&#160;

Cannabis has provided a sustainable source of fiber, food, energy and medicine for thousands of years. The plant&#8217;s constituents (cannabinoids), such as &#8710; 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, have been well-documented to have broad anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and nerve protecting abilities. However, they also inhibit or prevent the growth and spread of tumors or malignant cells. An understanding of the chemical and biochemical processes involved in the interaction of substances derived from Cannabis with live cell encapsulation provides the opportunity to develop &#8220;green&#8221; approaches to treating cancers, such as pancreatic, brain, breast and prostate, among others. We believe we are in a unique position among medical Cannabis and pharmaceutical companies to develop cannabinoid-based therapies utilizing our proprietary Cell-in-a-Box &#174; live cell encapsulation technology as the platform.

&#160;

In May 2014, we entered into a Research Agreement with the State of Colorado, acting on behalf of the Board of Trustees of the University of Northern Colorado. The goal of the ongoing research is to develop methods for the identification, separation and quantification of constitutes of Cannabis (some of which are prodrugs) that may be used in combination with our Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology to treat diseases. Initial studies have been undertaken using cannabinoid-like model compounds to identify the appropriate cell type that can convert the selected cannabinoid prodrugs into metabolites with antineoplastic activity. Once identified, the genetically modified cells that will produce the appropriate enzyme to convert that prodrug will be encapsulated using our Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology. The encapsulated cells and cannabinoid prodrugs identified by these studies will then be combined and used for future studies to evaluate their antineoplastic effectiveness.

&#160;

In December 2014, we acquired from Austrianova an exclusive, worldwide license to use the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology in combination with genetically modified non-stem cell lines which are designed to activate cannabinoid prodrug molecules for development of treatments for diseases and their related symptoms and the use of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; trademark for this technology (&#8220;Cannabis Licensing Agreement&#8221;).

&#160;

The agreements identified above and their respective payment obligations are described in more detail below under the caption &#8220;&#8212;Patents, Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets&#8212;Patents and Intellectual Property Agreements&#8221; in this Item 1. &#8220;Business.&#8221;

&#160;

Background of Our Encapsulation Technology

&#160;

The principal developers of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology are Prof. Dr. Walter H. G&#252;nzburg (&#8220;Dr. G&#252;nzburg&#8221;) and Dr. Brian Salmons (&#8220;Dr. Salmons&#8221;). Both are officers of SG Austria Pte Ltd (&#8220;SG Austria&#8221;) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Austrianova. We own a 14.5% equity interest in SG Austria and have contractual relationships, including license agreements, with SG Austria and Austrianova. The success of SG Austria and Austrianova are co-dependent in almost every respect with our success. SG Austria and Austrianova benefit from our success. As we reach certain &#8220;milestones&#8221; in the progression of our encapsulation technology towards the development of treatments for cancer and diabetes, payments are owed by us to SG Austria or Austrianova.

&#160;

Key Consultants

&#160;

Dr. G&#252;nzburg and Dr. Salmons are involved in numerous aspects of our scientific endeavors relating to our cancer and diabetes therapies, having initially commenced work for us as consultants at the beginning of 2014 under an oral agreement. They currently provide services to us as consultants through their consulting company, Vin-de-Bona Trading Company Pte Ltd (&#8220;Vin-de-Bona&#8221;). This arrangement was formalized in writing as of April 1, 2014, when we entered into a Consulting Agreement with Vin-de-Bona. The Consulting Agreement has an initial term of 12 months, with additional terms of 12 months automatically renewing unless either party terminates an additional term upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice. The professional services rendered to us by Dr. G&#252;nzburg and Dr. Salmons are charged at a negotiated and confidential hourly rate.

&#160;

The Consulting Agreement requires that Dr. G&#252;nzburg and Dr. Salmons not disclose or use our confidential information for any purpose, other than performing services under the Consulting Agreement, without our prior written consent. In addition, during the term of the Consulting Agreement and for a period of twelve months after termination or expiration of the Consulting Agreement, Dr. G&#252;nzburg and Dr. Salmons are prohibited from soliciting any of our customers, employees, suppliers or other persons with whom they had dealings during the tenure of their consultancy with us.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In September 2014, Dr. G&#252;nzburg was appointed as our Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. G&#252;nzburg was compensated by paying Vin-de-Bona 500,000 shares of our common stock. The shares were valued at the date of issuance, resulting in a non-cash expense of $98,500. Dr. G&#252;nzburg is compensated in the same way and in the same amount for each succeeding year during which he serves as our Chief Scientific Officer.

&#160;

Dr. Matthias L&#246;hr, a noted European oncologist and gastroenterologist, will also participate in the development of our pancreatic cancer treatment. Dr. L&#246;hr, currently with the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, served as Principal Investigator of the earlier Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 clinical trials (see below) of the combination of CapCell &#174; (now known as and hereinafter referred to as &#8220;Cell-in-a-Box &#174; &#8221;) with low-dose ifosfamide in patients with advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer. Like Dr. G&#252;nzburg and Dr. Salmons, Dr. L&#246;hr is involved in planning and overseeing much of the Phase 2b clinical trial. Dr. L&#246;hr is the Chairman of our Medical and Scientific Advisory Board (&#8220;Advisory Board&#8221;) and a consultant to us. Dr. L&#246;hr received 500,000 shares of our common stock to serve on the Advisory Board and will receive a like amount under a new Professional Services Agreement with us that became effective in May 2016. He also receives fees to provide professional consulting services to us through his consulting company based upon a confidential hourly rate.

&#160;

The professional services Dr. G&#252;nzburg, Dr. Salmons and Dr. L&#246;hr provide to us include work associated with our ongoing preclinical studies and the clinical trial we plan to conduct in the U.S. in 2017 involving malignant ascites, as well as our work in the cancer and diabetes arenas.

&#160;

Our Business

&#160;

PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc. is a Nevada corporation incorporated in 1996. In 2013, we restructured our operations in an effort to focus on biotechnology, having been a nutraceutical products company before then. The restructuring resulted in us focusing all of our efforts upon the development of a unique, effective and safe way to treat cancer and diabetes. On January 6, 2015, we changed our name from Nuvilex, Inc. to PharmaCyte Biotech, Inc. to better reflect the nature of our business.

&#160;

As discussed above, we are now a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing and preparing to commercialize therapies for cancer and diabetes using our proprietary cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology known as Cell-in-a-Box &#174; . This resulted from entering into several important agreements.

&#160;

On May 26, 2011, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (&#8220;SG Austria APA&#8221;) with SG Austria to purchase 100% of the assets and liabilities of SG Austria. As a result, Austrianova and Bio Blue Bird AG (&#34;Bio Blue Bird&#34;), then wholly-owned subsidiaries of SG Austria, were to become wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours on the condition that we pay SG Austria $2.5 million and 100,000,000 shares of our common stock. We were to receive 100,000 shares of common stock of Austrianova and nine bearer shares of Bio Blue Bird representing 100% of the ownership of Bio Blue Bird.

&#160;

Through two addenda to the SG Austria APA, the closing date of the SG Austria APA was extended twice by agreement between the parties.

&#160;

In June 2013, we and SG Austria entered into a Third Addendum to the SG Austria APA (&#8220;Third Addendum&#8221;). The Third Addendum materially changed the transaction contemplated by the SG Austria APA. Under the Third Addendum, we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Bio Blue Bird and received a 14.5% equity interest in SG Austria. In addition, we received nine bearer shares of Bio Blue Bird to reflect our 100% ownership of Bio Blue Bird. We paid: (i) $500,000 to retire all outstanding debt of Bio Blue Bird; and (ii) $1.0 million to SG Austria. We also paid SG Austria $1,572,193 in exchange for the 14.5% equity interest of SG Austria. The transaction required SG Austria to return to us the 100,000,000 shares of common stock held by SG Austria and for us to return to SG Austria the 100,000 shares of common stock of Austrianova we held.

&#160;

Effective as of the same date we entered into the Third Addendum, we and SG Austria entered into a Clarification Agreement to the Third Addendum (&#8220;Clarification Agreement&#8221;) to clarify and include certain language that was inadvertently left out of the Third Addendum. Among other things, the Clarification Agreement confirmed that the Third Addendum granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to use, with a right to sublicense, the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology for the development of treatments for cancer and use of Austrianova&#8217;s Cell-in-a-Box &#174; trademark and its associated technology.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Bio Blue Bird licensed certain types of genetically modified human cells (&#8220;Cells&#8221;) from Bavarian Nordic A/S (&#8220;Bavarian Nordic&#8221;) and GSF-Forschungszentrum f&#252;r Umwelt u. Gesundheit GmbH (collectively, &#8220;Bavarian Nordic/GSF&#8221;) pursuant to a License Agreement (&#8220;Bavarian Nordic/GSF License Agreement&#8221;) to develop a therapy for cancer using encapsulated Cells. The licensed rights to the Cells pertain to the countries in which Bavarian Nordic/GSF obtained patent protection. Hence, facilitated by the acquisition of Bio Blue Bird, the Third Addendum provides us with an exclusive, worldwide license to use the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology and trademark for the development of a therapy for cancer using the Cells.

&#160;

In June 2013, we entered into the Diabetes License Agreement. We paid Austrianova $2.0 million to secure this license.

&#160;

In October 2014, we entered into the Melligen Cell License Agreement. We are in the process of developing a therapy for diabetes by encapsulating the Melligen cells using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology.

&#160;

In December 2014, we entered into the Cannabis Licensing Agreement. We paid Austrianova $2.0 million to secure this license. We are in the process of developing therapies for cancer and its symptoms through genetically engineered cells designed to activate cannabinoid molecules that have been encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology.

&#160;

In July 2016, we entered into a Binding Memorandum of Understanding with Austrianova (&#8220;Austrianova MOU&#8221;). Pursuant to the Austrianova MOU, Austrianova will actively work to seek an investment partner or partners who will finance clinical trials and further develop products for the therapies for cancer, in exchange for which we, Austrianova and any future investment partner or partners will each receive a share of the net revenue of applicable products.

&#160;

Our Goal and Strategies to Implement

&#160;

Our goal is to become an industry-leading biotechnology company using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology as a platform upon which therapies for cancer and diabetes are developed and obtain marketing approval for these therapies from regulatory agencies in the U.S., the European Union, Australia and Canada.

&#160;

Our strategies to achieve this goal consist of the following:

&#160;

&#183; The completion of clinical trials in locally advanced, inoperable non-metastatic pancreatic cancer and its associated pain; &#160;

&#183; The completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will demonstrate the effectiveness of our cancer therapy in reducing the production and accumulation of malignant ascites fluid in the abdomen that is characteristic of pancreatic and other abdominal cancers; &#160;

&#183; The completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials that involve the encapsulation of the Melligen cells using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology to develop a treatment for Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes; &#160;

&#183; The enhancement of our ability to expand into the biotechnology arena through further research and partnering agreements in cancer and diabetes; &#160;

&#183; The acquisition of contracts that generate revenue or provide research and development capital utilizing our sublicensing rights; &#160;

&#183; The further development of uses of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology platform through contracts, licensing agreements and joint ventures with other companies; and &#160;

&#183; The completion of testing, expansion and marketing of existing and newly derived product candidates. &#160;

Cell Therapy Product Development

&#160;

In our effort to bring potential treatments to bear on pancreatic and other solid tumor cancers, we acquired Bio Blue Bird. This subsidiary holds exclusive worldwide licenses to our unique cellulose-based Cell-in-a-Box &#174; live cell encapsulation technology for use in oncology with certain types of live cells. We have also entered into license agreements (discussed above and below) to use Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology to develop a therapy for Type 1 and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes, as well as cancer therapies where the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology is combined with constituents of the Cannabis plant.

&#160;

Initially, focus will be placed on the preparations for our Phase 2b clinical trial in locally advanced, inoperable, non-metastatic pancreatic cancer. These preparations will include the live cell encapsulation of cancer prodrug-activating cells. For the Phase 2b clinical trial, as in the earlier Phase 1/2 and Phase 2 clinical trials, cells expressing a cytochrome P450 isozyme for use in cancer therapy will be utilized. These cells were used in the earlier clinical trials in patients with advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer. These cells were genetically engineered to convert the cancer prodrug ifosfamide into its active cancer-killing form. When the encapsulated cells were placed in close proximity to the cancerous tumor in the pancreas and then one-third of normal dose of the anticancer prodrug ifosfamide was given intravenously, the passage of the ifosfamide through the capsules created an elevated local concentration of an active chemotherapy drug capable of stopping the growth of or killing the cancer cells. The results of this &#8220;targeted chemotherapy&#8221; are discussed in more detail below.

&#160;

The Cell-in-a-Box &#174; encapsulation technology enables living cells to be used as miniature factories. The technology results in the formation of pin-head sized cellulose-based capsules in which genetically modified cells can be encapsulated and maintained. In the laboratory setting, which involves the large-scale amplification and production of useful biotech products outside the body of a person or animal, the proprietary live cell encapsulation technology creates a micro-environment in which these cells survive and flourish. They are protected from environmental challenges, such as the sheer forces associated with bioreactors, enabling greater growth and production of the end product.

&#160;

The Cell-in-a-Box &#174; encapsulation technology enables cells to survive in the human host and function like any other living cell in the body. Since the capsules produced using this technology contain small pores, small molecules (such as nutrients, oxygen and waste products) can pass through the pores of the capsules whereas the encapsulated cells and cells of the immune system cannot, thus enabling the encapsulated therapeutic cells to live in the body, thereby behaving like new miniature organs of the body without any inflammatory response or rejection.

&#160;

Market Opportunity and the Competitive Landscape

&#160;

The two areas we are currently developing for live cell encapsulation-based treatments are cancer and diabetes.

&#160;

The Cell-in-a-Box &#174; capsules are comprised of cotton&#8217;s natural component - bio-inert cellulose. Other materials used by competitors include alginate, collagen, chitosan, gelatin and agarose. Cellulose appears to be the most robust of these. We believe this inherent strength provides the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; capsules with advantages over the competition. For example, the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; capsules have remained intact for more than two years in humans and for several months in animals during preclinical studies and clinical trials with no evidence of rupture, damage, degradation, fibrous overgrowth or an immune system response. In addition, the cells within the capsules remained alive and well during the course of the studies and trials. Other encapsulating materials degrade over time in the human body, leaving the encapsulated cells open to immune system attack. Damage to surrounding tissues has also been reported to occur over time when other types of encapsulation materials degrade in the body.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe our live cell encapsulation technology brings significant new advantages and opportunities to market for us in numerous and developing ways. For example:

&#160;

&#183; The treatment of diseases by placing encapsulated drug-converting cells that convert the chemotherapeutic agent near the diseased tissue or organ; &#160;

&#183; The confinement and maintenance of therapeutic cells at the site of implantation at or near cancerous tumors ensuring &#8220;targeted chemotherapy;&#8221; &#160;

&#183; The increased efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs allowing for lower dosages and thus reduced side effects; &#160;

&#183; The potential for the treatment of systemic diseases of numerous types, including diabetes; &#160;

&#183; The provision of a safety mechanism for regulating cells that are introduced that would be desired to be maintained at specific sites in the body as a part of therapy; &#160;

&#183; The multi-layered patent and trade secret protection and marketing exclusivity for the technology that is being expanded; &#160;

&#183; The capsules that prevent immune system attack of functional cells without immunosuppressive drug therapy; and &#160;

&#183; The safety of the technology and the cells used that has already been shown in both human and animal clinical trials. &#160;

The field of diabetes cell therapy development is competitive. There are a number of companies developing cell based therapies for diabetes. We estimate that we have numerous competitors developing therapies for diabetes, including companies like Living Cell Technologies, Viacyte, Cellmed, Microislet Sciences, Cerco Medical and BetaCell who are developing some form of encapsulation-based therapy. Although such competition exists, we believe these other companies are developing encapsulation-based therapies using encapsulation materials and methodologies to produce capsules or devices that are far less robust than ours or that are associated with other problems that are not characteristic of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; capsules.

&#160;

Estimates indicate that, in approximately 25% of pancreatic cancer patients, the cancer is too advanced for any treatment due to late diagnosis and resulting short survival times. The disease is operable in approximately only 10% of patients after being diagnosed, largely because the disease shows no symptoms until it is at an advanced stage (stage III or IV) of development. However, over the past few years, radiologic techniques have advanced to the point where some pancreatic cancers may be detectable somewhat sooner. A new definition of &#8220;borderline operable&#8221; has been coined, and a greater number of pancreatic cancers are now being detected when they are &#8220;locally advanced&#8221; rather than after they have metastasized and spread to other organs in the body.

&#160;

Pancreatic cancer appears to be increasing in most industrialized countries. A 2012 report by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network predicted that pancreatic cancer will be the second cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. by 2020. More than 53,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2016 and about 41,800 deaths will occur. In Europe, newly diagnosed cases are expected to be about 90,000 this year.

&#160;

Our goal is to satisfy a clear unmet medical need for patients with locally advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer whose tumors no longer respond to the after 4-6 months of treatment with the chemotherapy combination of Abraxane &#174; (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) plus gemcitabine. For these patients, there is currently no effective therapy. We believe there will be no treatment comparable to our Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus low dose of ifosfamide combination treatment when it is used in these patients.

&#160;

There is, however, intense competition for the use of the product candidates being developed by us for treating pancreatic cancer patients. We estimate there are numerous potential competitors trying to improve the outcome for pancreatic cancer patients. There are a number of drugs already available and in the pipelines of pharmaceutical companies worldwide, not the least of which is the combination of the drugs of Abraxane &#174; and gemcitabine. This is the primary FDA-approved combination of drugs for treating advanced pancreatic cancer. Some of our competitive strengths include the patents and licensing agreements described in this Report which protect the ability to utilize encapsulated cells as a critical component of the driving force behind our treatments for cancer and diabetes. Yet many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do. They also have stronger name recognition, better brand loyalty and long-standing relationships with customers and suppliers. Our future success will be dependent upon our ability to compete.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Cell-in-a-Box &#174; based pancreatic cancer therapy has already shown promise through the completion of a Phase 1/2 and a Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer. Our diabetes cell therapy has also shown promise; the already completed research studies demonstrated positive responses in animal models using the Melligen cells. We believe we are in a strong competitive position in light of our unique encapsulation technology and the genetically modified cells that we have the exclusive world-wide license to use in the encapsulation process.

&#160;

As explained above, we estimate that we have two principal competitors for the development of Cannabis -based treatments for cancer &#8211; CSI and GWP. In contrast to the work being done by these companies, as our preliminary areas of research, we plan to use Cannabis to develop treatments for brain and pancreatic cancer.

&#160;

Earlier Clinical Trials Using Live Cell Encapsulation

&#160;

The two earlier clinical trials were carried out in Europe in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Both employed the combination of the cellulose-based live cell encapsulation technology with low doses of the anticancer drug ifosfamide. The results of the two clinical trials have appeared in the peer-reviewed scientific literature and are summarized as follows:

&#160;

Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial

&#160;

Dates of Trial and Location : The clinical trial was opened on July 28, 1998 and closed on September 20, 1999. It was carried out at the Division of Gastroenterology, University of Rostock, Germany.

&#160;

Identity of Trial Sponsors : The clinical trial was sponsored by Bavarian Nordic.

&#160;

Trial Design : The clinical trial was an open-label, prospective, single-arm and single center clinical trial.

&#160;

Patient Information : A total of 17 patients were enrolled in the clinical trial (51 were screened). A total of 14 patients were treated because two of the original 17 patients developed severe infections before the start of the clinical trial and had to be treated by other means. For the other patient, an angiography was not successful, causing the patient to be disqualified from participating in the clinical trial.

&#160;

Trial Criteria : Criteria for enrolling in the clinical trial included inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma stage III-IV (IUCC) as determined by histology and measured by CAT scan and with no prior chemotherapy.

&#160;

Duration of Treatment and Dosage Information : On day 0, celiac angiography was performed and 300 (in 13 patients, 250 in one) of the capsules containing the ifosfamide-activating cells were placed by supraselective catheterization of an artery leading to the tumor. Each capsule (~0.8 mm in diameter) contained about 10,000 cells. The cells overexpressed CYP2B1 (a cytochrome P450 isozyme), which catalyzed the conversion of the anticancer drug ifosfamide into its &#8220;cancer-killing&#8221; form.

&#160;

On day 1, patients were monitored for evidence of any clinically relevant adverse reactions, e.g. allergy and/or pancreatitis. On days 2-4, each patient received low-dose (1 g/m 2 body surface area) ifosfamide in 250 ml of normal saline was administered systemically as a 1-hour infusion. This was accompanied by a 60% dose equivalent of the uroprotective drug Mesna, which is used to reduce the side effects of ifosfamide chemotherapy, given as three intravenous injections. This regimen was repeated on days 23-25 for all but two patients who received only one round of ifosfamide. A total of only two cycles of ifosfamide were given to the remainder of the patients.

&#160;

Specific Clinical Endpoints : Median survival time from the time of diagnosis, the percentage of patients who survived one year or more and the quality of life of each patient were examined in the clinical trial.

&#160;

Observational Metrics Utilized and Actual Results Observed : Standard NCI criteria for evaluating tumor growth were used to assess results:

&#160;

&#183; stable disease (tumors 50-125% of initial size) (&#8220;SD&#8221;); &#160;

&#183; partial remission (more than 50% reduction in tumor volume) (&#8220;PR&#8221;); and &#160;

&#183; minor response (tumor reduction of between 25% and 50%) (&#8220;MR&#8221;). &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Effects of the treatment on tumor size were measured by CT scans. Control CT scans were scheduled for weeks 10 and 20, respectively. During the final visit a control angiography was performed. On the initial CT scan, the scan demonstrating the largest diameter of the primary tumor was identified and the area measured. Using appropriate landmarks, an identical scan was used for comparison. CT scans were evaluated by two unrelated radiologists, one of whom was not involved in the clinical trial. After formally finishing the clinical trial patients were followed on an ambulatory basis with visits once every three months.

&#160;

Toxicity was measured based on WHO/NCI guidelines on common toxicity criteria. The WHO and the National Cancer Institute (&#8220;NCI&#8221;) use standardized classifications of the adverse events associated with the use of cancer drugs. In cancer clinical trials, these are used to determine if a particular drug or treatment causes unwanted side effects (&#8220;Adverse Events&#8221;) when used under specific conditions. For example, the most commonly used classification is known as the &#8220;Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#8221; (CTCAE v. 4.0) developed by the NCI in the U.S. Most clinical trials carried out in the U.S. and the United Kingdom code their Adverse Event results according to this system which consists of five grades; these are: 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = life-threatening; 5 = death. In the studies reported for Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus low-dose ifosfamide combination in pancreatic cancer patients, the study investigators noted 11 Serious Adverse Events (&#8220;SAEs&#8221;) in 7 patients, none of which were believed to be treatment-related.

&#160;

Each patient&#8217;s need for pain medication and the quality of life (&#8220;QOL&#8221;) was monitored using a questionnaire established for pancreatic diseases. A QOL questionnaire for cancer patients, QLQ-C30, had been validated in several languages, but the module for pancreatic cancer per se was still under development at the time of the study with respect to reliability, sensibility against changes and multicultural validation. Accordingly, a version of the core questionnaire and a German QOL scale (published in 1995) for pancreas disease patients was used. QOL data were documented independently from safety and efficacy data by having patients complete an independent questionnaire. Assessment of QOL data did not interfere with routine documentation of Adverse Events reported by the patients. QOL questionnaires were analyzed according to criteria developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (&#8220;EORTC&#8221;). As used in the description of the QOL results discussed in the published report of the Phase 1/2 trial of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus low-dose ifosfamide combination in pancreatic cancer patients, the questionnaire was used to assess the QOL of patients undergoing treatment. The QOL was analyzed in a similar manner to the way that a QOL questionnaire developed by the EORTC is usually analyzed. This latter questionnaire is known as EORTC QLQ-C30. QOL data were available from the baseline evaluation for 14 patients and for analysis of change for 8 patients.

&#160;

A clinical benefit score based on variables, including the &#8220;Karnofsky Score&#8221; and body weight, was determined. Pain and analgesic consumption were calculated from the QOL questionnaires. The Karnofsky Score is a scale that is used to attempt to quantify a cancer patient&#8217;s general well-being and activities of daily life. It is often used to judge the suitability of patients for inclusion into clinical trials. As a clinical trial progresses, a patient&#8217;s Karnofsky Score can change. It is also used to assess a patient&#8217;s QOL as a clinical trial progresses. The scale starts at 100 (normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease) and decreases in decrements of 10 down through 50 (requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care) all the way to 10 (moribund, fatal processes progressing rapidly) and finally to 0 (deceased). Pain intensity was measured on a visual analog scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (the most intensive pain imaginable) in increments of 10. Analgesic consumption was assessed using a separate scale in which 0 indicated no regular consumption of analgesics and 25, 50 and 100 indicated administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opiates several times per year, per month or per week, respectively.

&#160;

The primary tumor did not grow in any of the 14 patients. Two patients had PR; 12 patients exhibited SD; and two patients showed a MR.

&#160;

Median survival time of patients in this clinical trial was 39 weeks. The one-year survival rate was 36%.

&#160;

Within the 20-week study period, three patients died from disease progression (on days 9, 85 and 132). Upon postmortem examination, the patient who died on day 9 from recurrent pulmonary embolism was found to have extensive tumor necrosis.

&#160;

The chemotherapy regimen was well tolerated with no toxicity beyond Grade 2 (moderate adverse effect) being detected in any of the 14 patients.

&#160;

Eleven SAEs were seen in 7 patients during the study period. None of them were treatment-related (due to capsule implantation or ifosfamide administration). These SAEs were attributed to underlying disease and/or the effects associated with the disease.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Implanting the capsules did not result in any obvious allergic or inflammatory response, and no patients developed pancreatitis during the clinical trial. Some patients exhibited elevated amylase levels, presumably due to tumor infiltration of the pancreas and limited obstructive chronic pancreatitis. However, no further increase in amylase levels was seen after angiography and capsule placement.

&#160;

In accordance with the report of the study, only one Adverse Event (increased lipase activity on day 15 after installation of the capsules), which was a Grade 1 Adverse Event, &#8220;may&#8221; have been linked to implanting the capsules.

&#160;

If a &#8220;clinical benefit&#8221; is considered to be either no increase or a decrease in pain intensity, then 10 of 14 patients experienced such a benefit. For 7 of the patients, this was confirmed by their analgesic consumption. None of these &#8220;benefited&#8221; patients registered an increased analgesic usage either in terms of dosage or WHO levels.

&#160;

None of the patients showed an increased Karnofsky Score after treatment. However, 7 of the 14 patients had stable Karnofsky Scores at the week 10 assessment. For 4 of these patients, their indices were still stable at the week 20 assessment.

&#160;

One patient&#8217;s body weight increased at both weeks 10 and 20 and another patient showed increased weight at week 10 (this patient withdrew from the clinical trial and no week 20 weight was obtained). Two patients showed stable body weights at week 10, one of whom dropped out of the clinical trial and the other showed weight loss at week 20.

&#160;

Two scenarios were used to establish the overall integrative clinical benefit response, where each patient was given a +2 score for an improved value, a +1 score for a stable value and a -1 score for a worsened value for each of four criteria (pain, analgesic consumption, Karnofsky Score and body weight) as compared to the relevant week 0 values.

&#160;

The &#8220;worst case scenario&#8221; required a pain relief score of 20 points or more to be judged an improvement and a decrease in the Karnofsky Score of 10 points or more to indicate worsening. Using this scenario, 50% or 7 of the treated patients experienced clinical benefit; 21.4% or 3 patients were neutral (benefits were offset by impairments); and 28.6% or 4 patients had no clinical benefit. The latter included those passing away before the median survival time.

&#160;

In the &#8220;best case scenario,&#8221; a pain relief score of 10 points or more was an improvement. A decrease in Karnofsky Score of 20 points or more was considered a worsening. In this scenario, 71.4% or 10 patients had clinical benefit, 14.2% of patients showed neither benefit nor deterioration and 14.3% patients had no benefit.

&#160;

Comparisons to Standard of Care : At the time this clinical trial was conducted, only one FDA-approved treatment for advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer was available. That was gemcitabine, first approved by the FDA in 1996.

&#160;

An examination of the prescribing information for gemcitabine reflects that the median survival seen in the Phase 3 pancreatic cancer clinical trial for gemcitabine was approximately 23 weeks (5.7 months). The percentage of one-year survivors was approximately 18%. In the Phase 3 clinical trial of Celgene&#8217;s Abraxane &#174; plus gemcitabine combination that was approved by the FDA in September 2013, the median survival time for patients was about 8.5 months and the percentage of one-year survivors was approximately 35%. By comparison, corresponding values from the Phase 1/2 reported clinical trial of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus ifosfamide combination were 39 weeks (approximately 9.8 months) and 36%, respectively.

&#160;

The treatment with gemcitabine of patients with pancreatic cancer is often associated with severe side effects. According to the prescribing information for gemcitabine, for use against pancreatic cancer, the recommended dose is 1000 mg/m 2 given intravenously over 30 minutes. The schedule of administration is: weeks 1-8, weekly dosing for 7 weeks followed by one-week rest and then after week 8, weekly dosing on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28-day cycles.

&#160;

Reductions in the doses of gemcitabine are necessitated by the occurrence of myelosuppression. Permanent discontinuation of gemcitabine is necessary for any of the following:

&#160;

&#183; unexplained dyspnea or other evidence of severe pulmonary toxicity; &#160;

&#183; severe hepatotoxicity; &#160;

&#183; hemolytic-uremic syndrome; &#160;

&#183; capillary leak syndrome; and &#160;

&#183; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Gemcitabine should be withheld or its dose reduced by 50% for other severe (Grade 3 or 4) non-hematologic toxicity until that toxicity is resolved.

&#160;

In contrast to the SAE&#8217;s seen with gemcitabine, as noted above under Observational Metrics Utilized and Actual Results Observed , the use of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus ifosfamide combination in this Phase 1/2 clinical trial was not associated with any serious (Grade 3 or 4) treatment-related side effects.

&#160;

Conclusions : In the opinion of the trial&#8217;s investigators, in this Phase 1/2 clinical trial the use of the combination of Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus low-dose ifosfamide is both safe and efficacious. This assessment was not based on the opinion of any drug regulatory authority and does not guarantee that that this assessment will be maintained in any late-phase clinical trial or that any drug regulatory authority will ultimately determine that the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus low-dose ifosfamide combination is safe and effective for the purposes of granting marketing approval.

&#160;

In the Phase 1/2 trial only a small number of patients were evaluable. As a result, statistical parameters were not used in the published reports of the Phase 1/2 trial to validate the anticancer efficacy of the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus low-dose ifosfamide combination in patients with advanced, inoperable pancreatic cancer. In the opinion of the investigators, the results indicate a trend towards efficacy, so the results should not be viewed as absolute numbers. It should be noted, however, that because the results were not statistically significant, any observations of efficacy must be weighed against the possibility that the results were due to chance alone. The purpose of the clinical trial was not to obtain data so that marketing approval could be obtained from regulatory authorities, but rather the clinical trial allowed us to determine whether the Cell-in-a- Box &#174; plus low-dose ifosfamide combination holds promise as a treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. In the cancer arena, Phase 1/2 clinical trials are used to first establish the safety of the drug or treatment being investigated and second to determine if a trend towards efficacy exists. In accordance with FDA guidance, as well as similar guidance from other regulatory authorities in countries other than the U.S., we fully realize that a large, multicenter, randomized, comparative study with statistically powerful findings would need to be conducted and the results from such a clinical trial would have to confirm those from the previous Phase 1/2 trial before an application for marketing approval could be made for the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; plus low-dose ifosfamide combination as a treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer.

&#160;

If our cancer therapy is approved by the regulatory agencies, it could provide a significant benefit to those with this devastating and deadly disease, not only in terms of life-span but also in terms of increased quality of life. In addition, we believe that success of the live cell encapsulation technology in the pancreatic cancer setting may lead to its successful use in developing treatments for other forms of solid cancerous tumors after preclinical studies and clinical trials have been completed.

&#160;

Phase 2 Clinical Trial

&#160;

Location of Trial : The clinical trial was opened on November 16, 1999 and closed on December 1, 2000. This clinical trial was carried out at four centers in two countries in Europe; these were in Berne, Switzerland, and in Rostock, Munich and Berlin, Germany.

&#160;

Trial Sponsor : The clinical trial was sponsored by Bavarian Nordic.

&#160;

Trial Design : This was an open-label, prospective, single-arm multi-site study.

&#160;

Patient Information : All 13 patients enrolled in the trial were treated. Twelve patients exhibited Stage IV disease. The remaining patient had Stage III disease. Ten of the 13 patients exhibited metastases.

&#160;

Duration of Treatment and Dosage Information : The number of capsules implanted varied 221 to 300 with a mean of 244. On day 1, patients were monitored for any allergic reactions to capsule implantation and or pancreatitis. The administration schedule of the treatment was as for the Phase 1/2 trial except that in this Phase 2 trial, the dose of ifosfamide was doubled to 2 g/m 2 from the 1g/m 2 used in the Phase 1/2 trial. On days 2-4, patients received 2 g/m 2 in normal saline as a one-hour infusion. In addition, the urinary tract protector Mesna was given as 3 intravenous injections. This regimen was repeated on days 23-25.

&#160;

Specific Clinical Endpoints : The primary objective was to determine response rate as defined by SD, PR and MR as well as the clinical benefit (Karnofsky score) of the treatment. The timing of the tumor size measurements and determination of tumor sizes by CT scans were done by independent radiologists. A secondary endpoint of the study was to determine time to progression, tumor response, duration of partial or complete remission, length of symptom-free survival, survival time and quality of life. Another secondary aim was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment regimen, with attention being paid to the appearance of pancreatitis or immediate allergic reactions.

&#160;

&#160;

Safety Analysis of Angiography, Capsule Implantation and Chemotherapy : On average, angiography took approximately 40 minutes. For 5 of the patients in this clinical trial, more than one blood vessel had to be used for placement of the capsules. The administration of the capsules was well tolerated. There were no signs of allergic reactions or hemorrhagic cystitis after implantation of the capsules. Two patients had increased levels of serum lipase at baseline. After additional measurements, these were not considered to be clinically relevant. The dose of ifosfamide (2 g/m 2 ) used was found to be toxic in the majority of patients. This resulted in one patient having to reduce the ifosfamide dose in the second of the two cycles of treatment with the drug. The most common toxic effects were nausea, vomiting, malaise, anorexia and mild hematuria.

&#160;

Serious Adverse Events : A total of 16 SAEs were documented in eight patients, including 3 SAEs leading to death. None of these SAEs could be attributed to placement of the encapsulated cells. One patient experienced neurological impairment (drowsiness, nocturnal enuresis, mild somnolence) which was attributed to treatment with the 2 g/m 2 dose of ifosfamide. All of the patients experienced between 5 and 19 SAEs. Six SAEs were rated as life-threatening; 10.2% were rated as severe; 28.7% were rated as moderate; and 53.7% were rated as mild. None of the SAEs was thought to be related to placement of the encapsulated cells, but 44% were related to the administration of ifosfamide at the dose given. Most frequent SAEs were alopecia, anemia, leucopenia, nausea and vomiting or encephalopathy. Other SAEs were new or worse symptoms of the patients&#8217; underlying disease. A total of 65 events met the NCI&#8217;s common toxicity criteria. Of these, 46.2% had Grade 1, 40% had Grade 2, 9.2% had Grade 3 and 4.6% had Grade 4 toxicities.

&#160;

Tumor Reductions and Patient Survival Results : The size of the primary tumor was measured prior to starting ifosfamide treatment and at weeks 10 and 20 post-treatment. No PRs were observed, but 4 patients exhibited tumor size reductions, 4 patients showed tumor growth and the remaining 5 patients had SD over the &#8220;follow-up&#8221; period after chemotherapy.

&#160;

The median survival of patients was 40 weeks. The majority of the survival benefit was shown early during the entire observation period. However, as time progressed, these patients succumbed at the same rate as historical controls. This observation suggested to the investigators that prolongation of the survival benefit might be achieved if additional courses of ifosfamide chemotherapy were given. The one-year survival rate was 23%. It was thought that this may be attributable to the higher dose of ifosfamide used in this Phase 2 clinical trial.

&#160;

Quality of Life : An assessment of the quality of life of the patients was performed in this Phase 2 clinical trial. Quality of life data were available for all of the patients. According to this quality of life assessment, although pain during the night decreased, patients felt themselves to be less attractive and lost interest in sex. No additional improvements in patients&#8217; quality of life were observed.

&#160;

Conclusions : The opinions of the investigators were are follows: (i) the lack of &#8220;problems&#8221; associated with the implanted encapsulated cells was noted as in the Phase 1/2 trial; (ii) administering more than two courses of treatment with ifosfamide might have beneficial effects on survival; and (iii) since doubling the dose of ifosfamide from that used in the Phase 1/2 trial had no beneficial antitumor or survival effect but was associated with increased side effects from the treatment, the dose of ifosfamide to be used in combination with the encapsulated cells for all future trials should be 1g/m 2 .

Manufacturing

&#160;

We are outsourcing all cell growth, processing and encapsulation services needed in connection with our future clinical trials of the encapsulated cell-based cancer and diabetes treatments. The encapsulation will be done by Austrianova in its GMP-compliant manufacturing facility in Bangkok, Thailand.

&#160;

We have engaged ViruSure GmbH (&#8220;ViruSure&#8221;), a professional cell growing and adventitious agent testing company that has had extensive experience with the CYP2B1-expressing cells that will be needed for our pancreatic cancer treatment. We did so in order to recover them from frozen stocks of similar cells and regenerate new stocks for use by us in our preclinical studies and clinical trials. ViruSure is in the process of cloning new cells from a selected clone. Those clones will be grown to populate a master cell bank (&#8220;MCB&#8221;) and a working cell bank (&#8220;WCB&#8221;) for our future clinical trials.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In April 2014, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with ViruSure pursuant to which ViruSure will clone cells from the 22P1G cell line (the cells that express the CYP2B1 isoform of cytochrome P450 that converts ifosfamide into its cancer-killing form). ViruSure is developing the MCB and, from that, the WCB. The MCB is to be used as a &#8220;safe&#8221; repository of the cloned cells we will use in our cancer therapy. The WCB will be used to supply the large numbers of cells needed for our preclinical studies, clinical trials and other purposes related to the development of our treatment for advanced pancreatic and other forms of solid tumor cancers. Compensation to ViruSure is set forth in separate agreements corresponding to specific orders. The price, fees and payment schedule depend upon the particular work being undertaken by ViruSure on our behalf.

&#160;

In March 2014, we entered into a Manufacturing Framework Agreement with Austrianova (&#8220;Manufacturing Framework Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which Austrianova will encapsulate the genetically engineered live cells that will be used for our cancer therapy. We also have contracted with Austrianova to provide encapsulated insulin-producing cells for our preclinical studies in diabetes. At the appropriate time, we will enter into a similar Manufacturing Framework Agreement with Austrianova for the encapsulated cells we will need for our diabetes therapy.

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the Austrianova MOU, Austrianova and we have agreed to commence negotiating during the third quarter of this calendar year a new manufacturing framework agreement pursuant to which Austrianova will provide us with Phase 3 clinical material utilizing the genetically engineered cells designed to activate cannabinoid molecules that have been encapsulated using the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States with study sites in Europe.

&#160;

Government Regulation and Product Approval

&#160;

As a development stage biotechnology company that operates in the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;) and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the U.S., we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our product candidates in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;), but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful.

&#160;

Regulatory approval, if and when obtained, may be limited in scope which may significantly limit the uses for which a product may be placed into the market. Further, approved drugs or biologic products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to ongoing post-marketing review, inspection and discovery of previously unknown problems with such products or the manufacturing or quality control procedures used in their production, which may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market. Any failure or delay by us, our suppliers of manufactured drug product, collaborators or licensees in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the marketing of our product candidates and our ability to receive product revenue, license revenue or profit sharing payments. For more information, see Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;

&#160;

U.S. Government Regulation

&#160;

The FDA is the main regulatory body that controls pharmaceuticals and biologics in the U.S. Its regulatory authority is based in the FDC Act and the Public Health Service Act (&#8220;PHSA&#8221;). Pharmaceutical products and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes. A failure to comply explicitly with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The steps required before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally include:

&#160;

&#183; completion of preclinical studies, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practices (&#8220;GLP&#8221;) protocols and regulations; &#160;

&#183; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;GMP&#8221;), and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; &#160;

&#183; submission to the FDA of an IND (defined below) to support human clinical testing in the U.S.; &#160;

&#183; approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; &#160;

&#183; performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and with Good Clinical Practices (&#8220;GCPs&#8221;) standards to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product candidate for each target indication; &#160;

&#183; submission of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) for a drug, or Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) for a biologic, to the FDA; &#160;

&#183; satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; and &#160;

&#183; FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. &#160;

Clinical Development

&#160;

Before a product may be given to humans, it must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate&#8217;s chemistry and biological activities and animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy in humans. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) which must be reviewed by the FDA for safety and other considerations before a clinical trial in humans can begin.

&#160;

An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product candidate to humans. This authorization is required before interstate shipping and administration of any new drug or biologic product to humans in the U.S. that is not the subject of an approved NDA or BLA. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. A clinical trial involves the administration of the investigational product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators following GCP standards. These international standards are meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors. A clinical trial is conducted under protocols that detail the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

&#160;

Typically, a clinical trial in humans involves a three-phase process. We devote significant resources to research and development programs in an effort to discover and develop potential future product candidates. The product candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. The path to regulatory approval includes three phases of clinical trials in which we collect data to support an application to regulatory agencies to allow us to ultimately market a product for treatment of a specified disease. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in research and development of new products, resulting in a high rate of failure. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval, and ultimately to market, takes years and the costs to do so are significant. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after the product is approved, based on post-marketing factors. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, reimbursement challenges, difficulty or excessive costs of manufacture, alternative therapies or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Uncertainties in the approval process of the regulatory agencies can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunities. Consequently, it is very difficult to predict which products will ultimately be submitted for approval, which have the highest likelihood of obtaining approval and which will be commercially viable and generate profits. Successful results in preclinical or clinical studies may not be an accurate predictor of the ultimate safety or effectiveness of a product candidate.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Phase 1 Clinical Trial : A Phase 1 clinical trial begins when a regulatory agency, such as the FDA, allows initiation of clinical investigation of a new product candidate. The clinical trial studies a product candidate&#8217;s safety profile and may include a preliminary determination of a product candidate&#8217;s safe dosage range. The Phase 1 clinical trial also determines how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted by the body and, therefore, the potential duration of its action.

&#160;

Phase 2 Clinical Trial : A Phase 2 clinical trial is conducted on a limited number of patients with the targeted disease. An initial evaluation of the product candidate&#8217;s effectiveness on subjects is performed and additional information on the product candidate&#8217;s safety and dosage range is obtained. For many diseases, a Phase 2 clinical trial normally includes up to several hundred patients.

&#160;

Phase 3 Clinical Trial : A Phase 3 clinical trial is typically rigorously controlled, conducted in multiple centers and involves a larger target patient population that can consist of from several hundred to thousands of patients to ensure that study results are statistically significant. During a Phase 3 clinical trial, physicians monitor subjects to determine efficacy and to gather further information on safety. A Phase 3 clinical trial is designed to generate all of the clinical data necessary to submit an application for marketing approval to a regulatory agency.

&#160;

The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA or IRB/ethics committees, or by a company for various reasons. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial&#8217;s patients. In some cases, a clinical trial is overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, or the clinical monitoring board. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points. These decisions are based on the limited access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of a clinical trial if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of an ongoing clinical trial of a product candidate on public registries and the disclosure of certain information pertaining to the trial as well as clinical trial results after completion.

&#160;

A sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment (&#8220;SPA&#8221;), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. A sponsor meeting the regulatory criteria may make a specific request for an SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins. All open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. Having an SPA does not guarantee that a product candidate will receive FDA approval.

&#160;

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational product candidate information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA to request regulatory approval for the product in the specified indications.

&#160;

New Drug Applications and Biologic Licensing Applications

&#160;

In order to obtain approval to market a drug or biologic in the U.S., a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent non-clinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing and controls (&#8220;CMC&#8221;), as well as the proposed labeling for the product, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In most cases, the NDA, in the case of a drug, or BLA, in the case of a biologic, must be accompanied by a substantial user fee; there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. The FDA will initially review the NDA or BLA for completeness before it accepts the application for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten to twelve months. The FDA can extend this review by three months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP standards. The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

&#160;

Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP standards. Manufacturers of human cellular or tissue-based biologics also must comply with the FDA&#8217;s Good Tissue Practices, as applicable, and the general biological product standards. After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

&#160;

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (&#8220;ETASU&#8221;). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug&#8217;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

&#160;

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA/BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA/BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs/BLA.

&#160;

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information

&#160;

A sponsor of a clinical trial of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs and biologics, is required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial are made public as part of the registration. A sponsor is also obligated to disclose the results of a clinical trial after completion. Disclosure of the results can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Advertising and Promotion

&#160;

The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs or biologics for &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses (uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug&#8217;s labeling) because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off-label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a product for off-label use, but may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;), the Office of the Inspector General of Health &#38; Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) and state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements, that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.

&#160;

Post Approval Regulations

&#160;

After regulatory approval of a drug or biologic is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA or BLA, a company would be required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to GMP standards after approval to assure and preserve the long term stability of the drug or biological product. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP standards, which imposes extensive procedural and substantive record keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP standards and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a company and any third-party manufacturers that a company may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP standards and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

&#160;

U.S. Patent Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160; 

In seeking approval for a drug through a NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the &#8220;Orange Book.&#8221; Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) or 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients, same strengths and dosage form, as the listed drug and has been shown through testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 505(b)(2) applications provide for marketing of a drug product that may have the same active ingredients as the listed drug and contain full safety and effectiveness data as an NDA, but at least some of this information comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the new product. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or removes) any language regarding a patented method of use rather than certify to such listed method of use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A certification that the new product will not infringe upon the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until 30 months, at the earliest, of expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.

&#160;

The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.

&#160;

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (&#8220;BPCIA&#8221;) amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its product as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval.

&#160;

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if granted, may be eligible for limited patent term extension (restoration) under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (&#8220;Hatch-Waxman Act&#8221;). The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years, as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The length of the patent term restoration is related to the length of time the drug, biologic or medical device is under regulatory review and is calculated as half of the testing phase, which is the time between the IND submission becoming effective and the NDA, BLA or premarket approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) submission, and all of the review phase, which is the time between NDA, BLA or PMA submission and approval, up to a maximum extension of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, biologic or medical device. In the future, if and when any of our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term restoration on patents covering those products that may be eligible for such patent term restoration.

&#160;

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

&#160;

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

&#160;

European and Other International Government Regulation

&#160;

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (&#8220;CTA&#8221;) much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug or biologic under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (&#8220;MAA&#8221;) with the EMA. It is generally similar to the NDA or BLA, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.

&#160;

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP standards, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

&#160;

Regulatory Review

&#160;

If a product candidate successfully completes a Phase 3 clinical trial and is submitted to regulatory agencies, such as the FDA in the U.S. and the EMA in Europe, the time to final marketing approval can vary from six months to several years, depending on a number of variables. These variables can include such things as the disease type, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the agency to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications will be consistent across geographic areas. In some cases, further studies beyond the three-phase clinical trial process described above are required as a condition for approval of an NDA, an MAA or a BLA. Each country-specific regulatory agency requires monitoring of all aspects of clinical trials and reports of all adverse events must be made. A regulatory agency may also require the conduct of pediatric studies for the product and indication either before or after submission of a NDA or a BLA.

&#160;

Approval by Regulatory Agencies

&#160;

The results of the preclinical testing, production parameters and a clinical trial are submitted to the regulatory agency as part of a NDA, MAA or a BLA for evaluation to determine if there is substantial evidence that the product is sufficiently safe and effective to warrant approval. In responding to a NDA, MAA or a BLA, the regulatory agency may grant market approval, deny approval or request additional information.

&#160;

Compliance

&#160;

During all phases of development (pre- and post-marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

Special Regulatory Procedures

&#160;

The FDA has developed distinct approaches to make new drugs and biologics available as rapidly as possible in cases where there is no available treatment or there are advantages over existing treatments. For example, the FDA may grant &#8220;Accelerated Approval&#8221; to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For Accelerated Approval, the product must have an effect on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product candidate, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit. These studies are known in as confirmatory trials. Accelerated Approval of a product may be withdrawn or the labeled indication of the drug changed if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the product candidate.

&#160;

The FDA may grant &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product&#8217;s development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, eligibility for Accelerated Approval if relevant criteria are met and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of a NDA or a BLA for regulatory agency review before the entire submission is completed. Fast Track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive regulatory agency approval.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA&#8217;s &#8220;Breakthrough Therapy&#8221; designation for a product candidate is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs and biologics that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, robust FDA-sponsor interaction and communication can help to identify the most efficient and expeditious path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.

&#160;

The FDA may grant &#8220;Priority Review&#8221; status to product candidates that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Priority Review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a NDA or a BLA, with the goal to take action on the application within six months.

&#160;

Orphan Drug Status

&#160;

In accordance with laws and regulations pertaining to regulatory agencies, a sponsor may request that the regulatory agencies designate a drug or biologic intended to treat a &#8220;Rare Disease or Condition&#8221; as an &#8220;Orphan Drug.&#8221; For example, in the U.S., a &#8220;Rare Disease or Condition&#8221; is defined as one which affects less than 200,000 people in the U.S., or which affects more than 200,000 people but for which the cost of developing and making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of the product in the U.S. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug or biologic designated as an Orphan Drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled to 7 years of exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of persons with the disease. In Europe, this exclusivity is 10 years. However, Orphan Drug status is particular to the approved indication and does not prevent another company from seeking approval of an off-patent drug that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. An Orphan Drug may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with the disease state, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, the risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the agency to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications will be consistent across geographic areas.

&#160;

Priority Review and Accelerated Review

&#160;

Based on results of a Phase 3 clinical trial submitted in an NDA or BLA, upon the request of an applicant, a priority review designation may be granted to a product by the FDA, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months from the FDA&#8217;s decision on priority review application, or eight months from the NDA filing. Priority review is given where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the standard FDA review period is ten months from the FDA&#8217;s decision on priority review application, or 12 months from the NDA or BLA filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

&#160;

Under a centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding &#8220;clock stops,&#8221; when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (&#8220;CHMP&#8221;). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, for example, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, which takes into consideration: (i) the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; (ii) the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and (iii) anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Healthcare Reform

&#160;

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;). The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare will be delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. The Affordable Care Act is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:

&#160;

&#183; an annual, nondeductible fee on any covered entity engaged in manufacturing or importing certain branded prescription drugs and biological products, apportioned among such entities in accordance with their respective market share in certain government healthcare programs; &#160;

&#183; an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13.0% of the Average Manufacturer Price (&#8220;AMP&#8221;), for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the AMP; &#160;

&#183; expansion of the scope of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance; &#160;

&#183; a new partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, or Medicare Part D, coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50.0% point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers&#8217; outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; &#160;

&#183; extension of manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; &#160;

&#183; expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133.0% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability; &#160;

&#183; expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; &#160;

&#183; new requirements to report annually specified financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any &#8220;payments or transfers of value&#8221; made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, with data collection required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) required beginning March 31, 2014 and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year; &#160;

&#183; a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; &#160;

&#183; a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and &#160;

&#183; a mandatory nondeductible payment for employers with 50 or more full time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents, beginning in 2015 (pursuant to relief enacted by the Treasury Department). &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Affordable Care Act also established an Independent Payment Advisory Board (&#8220;IPAB&#8221;) to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. Beginning in 2014, the IPAB was mandated to propose changes in Medicare payments if it determines that the rate of growth of Medicare expenditures exceeds target growth rates. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce expenditures, which may have a negative impact on payment rates for pharmaceutical and biologic products. A proposal made by the IPAB is required to be implemented by the U.S. federal government&#8217;s CMS unless Congress adopts a proposal with savings greater than those proposed by the IPAB. The IPAB has not yet been called upon to act as the annual determinations by the CMS Office of the Actuary have not identified a savings target for implementation years 2015 or 2016.

&#160;

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (&#8220;Joint Select Committee&#8221;) to recommend proposals for spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our future customers, patients and third-party payors and, accordingly, our financial operations.

&#160;

In January 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program. The final rule, effective April 1, 2016, among other things, revises the manner in which the &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, there has been recent significant negative publicity and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs and it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, products financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

We anticipate that the Affordable Care Act and other legislative reforms will result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business, though we are still unsure what its full impact will be. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue in the future. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.

&#160;

Coverage and Reimbursement

&#160;

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates, if approved, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Existing federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to state governments, based on a statutory formula, on covered outpatient drugs reimbursed by the Medicaid program as a condition of having their drugs paid for by AMP. AMP is determined by a statutory formula that is based on prices defined in the statute. AMP must be calculated for all products that are covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid program and be the &#8220;best price.&#8221; Best price must be calculated only for those covered outpatient drugs that are a single source drug or innovator multiple source drug, such as biologic products. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and best price for each of their covered outpatient drugs to the government on a regular basis. Additionally, some state Medicaid programs have imposed a requirement for supplemental rebates over and above the formula set forth in federal law as a condition for coverage. In addition to the Medicaid rebate program, federal law also requires that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer wishes to have its outpatient drugs covered under Medicaid as well as under Medicare Part B, it must sign a &#8220;Master Agreement&#8221; obligating it to provide a formulaic discount of approximately 24%, known as the federal ceiling price for drugs sold to the U.S. Departments of Defense (including the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard, and also provide discounts through a drug pricing agreement meeting the requirements of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, for outpatient drugs sold to certain specified eligible healthcare organizations. The formula for determining the discounted purchase price under the 340B drug pricing program is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and rebate amount for a particular product as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above.

&#160;

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. The European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

&#160;

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.

&#160;

Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

&#160;

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

&#160;

In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the HHS, and its Office of Inspector General, the Office for Civil Rights that has jurisdiction over matters relating to individuals&#8217; privacy and protected health information, the DOJ, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ and state and local governments.

&#160;

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted broadly to proscribe arrangements and conduct where only one purpose of the remuneration between the parties was to induce or reward referrals and the term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable safe harbor or statutory exemption, however, does not make the arrangement or conduct per se unlawful under the Anti-Kickback Statute; instead, in such cases, the legality of the arrangement would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances to ascertain the parties&#8217; intent.

&#160;

&#160; 26 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Moreover, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, as discussed below.

&#160;

The civil monetary penalties statute, imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

&#160;

The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of the product for unapproved---and thus non-reimbursable--- uses. The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have additional similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the type of payor.

&#160;

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

&#160;

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other &#8220;transfers of value&#8221; made to such physician owners. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;. Manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and submit reports on aggregate payment data to the government for the first reporting period of August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, by March 31, 2014, and to report detailed payment data for the first reporting period and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by June 30, 2014. Thereafter, manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. CMS made all reported data publicly available starting on September 30, 2014. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose additional restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/ or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.

&#160;

In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing products as they move through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing specified physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit other specified sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 27 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

&#160;

Controlled Substances Regulation

&#160;

Our product candidates involving Cannabis contain controlled substances, as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (&#8220;CSA&#8221;). The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a &#8220;closed system&#8221; of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;). The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.

&#160;

The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules&#8212;Schedule I, II, III, IV or V&#8212;with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the U.S. and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. They may be used only in federally approved research programs and may not be marketed or sold for dispensing to patients in the U.S. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The regulatory requirements are more restrictive for Schedule II substances than Schedule III substances. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist in most situations and cannot be refilled.

&#160;

Following NDA approval of a drug containing a Schedule I controlled substance, that substance must be rescheduled as a Schedule II, III, IV or V substance before it can be marketed. On November 17, 2015, H.R. 639, Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act, passed through both houses of Congress. On November 25, 2015 the bill was signed into law. The new law removes uncertainty associated with timing of the DEA rescheduling process after NDA approval. Specifically, it requires DEA to issue an &#8220;interim final rule,&#8221; pursuant to which a manufacturer may market its product within 90 days of FDA approval. The new law also preserves the period of orphan marketing exclusivity for the full seven years such that this period only begins after DEA scheduling. This contrasts with the previous situation whereby the orphan &#8220;clock&#8221; began to tick upon FDA approval, even though the product could not be marketed until DEA scheduling was complete.

&#160;

Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincident activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 28 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. An application for a manufacturing registration as a bulk manufacturer for a Schedule I or II substance must be published in the Federal Register, and is open for 30 days to permit interested persons to submit comments, objections or requests for a hearing. A copy of the notice of the Federal Register publication is forwarded by DEA to all those registered, or applicants for registration, as bulk manufacturers of that substance. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. As with applications for registration as a bulk manufacturer, an application for an importer registration for a Schedule I or II substance must also be published in the Federal Register, which remains open for 30 days for comments. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary to ensure that the U.S. complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties.

&#160;

For drugs manufactured in the U.S., the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the U.S. based on the DEA&#8217;s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount of Cannabis that the DEA allows to be produced in the U.S. each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must annually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.

&#160;

The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.

&#160;

Patents, Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets

&#160;

Intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) and patent protection are of paramount importance to our business, as are the trade secrets and other strategies we have employed with Austrianova to protect the proprietary Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology. Although we believe we take reasonable measures to protect our IP and trade secrets and those of Austrianova, we cannot guarantee we will be able to protect and enforce our IP or obtain international patent protection for our product candidates as needed. We and some of our subsidiaries license patents and trademarks and have exclusive worldwide licensing rights to numerous patents in multiple countries over three technical areas: (i) live cell encapsulation with cells that express cytochrome P450 where the capsule is permeable to prodrug molecules and the cells are retained within the capsules; (ii) treatment of solid cancerous tumors; and (iii) encapsulation of cells for producing retroviral particles for gene therapy. In addition, we have exclusive worldwide licensing rights to patents, trademarks and know-how using Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology in the diabetes field and in the treatment of diseases and related conditions using the constituents of Cannabis . Litigation may be required to protect our product candidates, IP rights and trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Maintenance of our IP utilizes financial and operational resources. In addition, the possibility exists that our IP could be discovered to be owned by others, be invalid or be unenforceable, potentially bringing unforeseen challenges to us.

Third Addendum to the SG Austria APA

&#160;

In June 2013, we and SG Austria entered into the Third Addendum and the Clarification Agreement. The Third Addendum requires us to make the following payments for the purchased assets, which payments were timely made in full under the payment deadlines set forth in the Third Addendum:

&#160;

&#183; A $60,000 payment due under the SG Austria APA; &#160;

&#183; A payment of Stamp Duty estimated to be $10-17,000 to the Singapore Government; &#160;

&#183; $500,000 to be used to pay off the existing debt of Bio Blue Bird; and &#160;

&#183; $1,000,000. &#160;

The Third Addendum provides that if the payments listed above are insufficient or fail to meet specified payment deadlines, the Third Addendum and the SG Austria APA automatically terminate and will be deemed null and void.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Third Addendum, we agreed to enter into a manufacturing agreement with SG Austria on specified payment terms for initiating, carrying out and completing the clinical preparation of the pancreatic cancer treatment trial material, the licenses for which were included in the assets purchased under the SG Austria APA. The payment terms for the manufacturing agreement to be entered into with SG Austria agreed to in the Third Addendum were superseded by the Manufacturing Framework Agreement. Austrianova is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SG Austria. The Manufacturing Framework Agreement requires us to pay Austrianova a one-time manufacturing setup fee in the amount of $647,000, of which 50% is required to be paid on the effective date of the Manufacturing Framework Agreement and 50% is required to be paid three months later. We have paid the full amount of the one-time manufacturing setup fee. In addition, the Manufacturing Framework Agreement requires us to pay a fee for producing the final encapsulated cell product of $647 per vial of 300 capsules after production with a minimum purchased batch size of 400 vials of any Cell-in-a-Box &#174; product. The fees under the Manufacturing Framework Agreement are subject to annual increases according to the annual inflation rate in the country in which the encapsulated cell products are manufactured.

&#160;

The Third Addendum is an outright purchase. The Third Addendum requires us to make future royalty and milestone payments as follows:

&#160;

&#183; Two percent royalty on all gross sales received by us or our affiliates; &#160;

&#183; Ten percent royalty on gross revenues received by us or our affiliates from any sublicense or right to use the patents or the licenses granted by us or our affiliates; &#160;

&#183; Milestone payments of $100,000 due 30 days after enrollment of the first human patient in the first clinical trial for each product; $300,000 due 30 days after enrollment of the first human patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial for each product; and $800,000 due 60 days after having a NDA or a BLA approved by the FDA or a MAA approved in Europe or its equivalent based on the country in which it is accepted for each product; and &#160;

&#183; Milestone payments of $50,000 due 30 days after enrollment of the first veterinary patient in the first trial for each product and $300,000 due 60 days after having a BLA, a NDA or a MAA or its equivalent approved based on the country in which it is accepted for each veterinary product. &#160;

We were granted a right of first refusal pursuant to the Third Addendum with respect to any offers made by SG Austria related to the granting of a license with respect to any patents or technologies related to live cell encapsulation that can be applied to use the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; technology to create products in the following areas: (i) dermal fillers; (ii) medical marijuana; (iii) diabetes; and (iv) virally caused infectious diseases.

&#160;

Under the Diabetes Licensing Agreement, we are required to make a payment of $2,000,000 in two equal payments of $1,000,000 each. We made our first $1,000,000 payment on October 30, 2013. Our second payment of $1,000,000 was made on February 25, 2014.

&#160;

The Diabetes Licensing Agreement requires us to pay Austrianova, pursuant to a manufacturing agreement to be entered into between the parties, a one-time manufacturing setup fee in the amount of $633,144, of which 50% is required to be paid on the signing of a manufacturing agreement for a product and 50% is required to be paid three months later. In addition, the Diabetes Licensing Agreement requires us to pay a manufacturing production fee, which is to be defined in the manufacturing agreement, for producing the final encapsulated cell product of $633.14 per vial of 300 capsules after production with a minimum purchased batch size of 400 vials of any Cell-in-a-Box&#174; product. All costs for encapsulated cell products will be subject to an annual increase equal to the published rate of inflation in the country of manufacture of the vials.

&#160;

The Diabetes Licensing Agreement requires us to make future royalty and milestone payments as follows:

&#160;

&#183; Ten percent royalty of the gross sale of all products we sell; &#160;

&#183; Twenty percent royalty of the amount actually received by us from sub-licensees on sub-licensees&#8217; gross sales; and &#160;

&#183; Milestone payments of $100,000 within 30 days of beginning the first pre-clinical experiments using the encapsulated cells; $500,000 within 30 days after enrollment of the first human patient in the first clinical trial; $800,000 within 30 days after enrollment of the first human patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial; and $1,000,000 due 60 days after having a NDA or a BLA approved by the FDA or a MAA approved in Europe or its equivalent based on the country in which it is accepted for each product. &#160;

The license under the Diabetes Licensing Agreement may be terminated and all rights will revert to Austrianova if any of the following milestone events do not occur within the following timeframes (subject to any and all of the necessary and required research having been successful and the relevant product being sufficiently prepared for being able to enter into such clinical trials):

&#160;

&#183; If we do not enter into a research program with technology in the scope of the license providing a total funding equal to or greater than $400,000 with European academic university partners within three years of June 25, 2013, the effective date of the Diabetes Licensing Agreement; or &#160;

&#183; If we do not enter into a clinical trial or its equivalent for a product within seven years of the effective date of the Diabetes Licensing Agreement. &#160;

In June 2016, the parties amended the Diabetes Licensing Agreement with respect to the requirement that we enter into a research program with the technology within three years of the effective date of the Diabetes Licensing Agreement to provide that such research program need not be with European academic university partners.

&#160;

Melligen Cell License Agreement

&#160;

The Melligen Cell License Agreement was amended in April 2016 to change the name of the license to our current name and clarify certain ambiguities in the agreement. It does not require any &#8220;up-front&#8221; payment to UTS. We are required to pay the Melligen cell patent prosecution costs and to pay to UTS a patent administration fee equal to 15% of all amounts paid by UTS to prosecute and maintain patents related to Melligen cells.

The Melligen Cell License Agreement requires that we pay royalty and milestone payments to UTS as follows:

&#160;

&#183; Six percent gross exploitation revenue on product sales; &#160;

&#183; Twenty-five percent of gross revenues if the product is sub-licensed by us; and &#160;

&#160; 33 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In the event of a default under the Melligen Cell License Agreement, the non-defaulting party may immediately terminate the agreement by notice in writing to the defaulting party if: (i) the default has continued for not less than 14 days or occurred more than 14 days earlier and has not been remedied; (ii) the non-defaulting party serves upon the defaulting party notice in writing requiring the default to be remedied within 30 days of such notice, or such greater number of days as the non-defaulting party may in its discretion allow, and (iii) the defaulting party has failed to comply with the notice referred to in (ii) above.

&#160;

Cannabis Licensing Agreement

&#160;

Pursuant to the Cannabis Licensing Agreement, we acquired from Austrianova an exclusive world-wide license world to use the Cell-in-a-Box &#174; trademark and its associated technology with genetically modified non-stem cell lines which are designed to activate cannabinoids to develop therapies involving Cannabis with a right to sublicense

. 

Under the Cannabis Licensing Agreement, we are required to pay Austrianova an Upfront Payment of $2,000,000. We have the right to make periodic monthly partial payments of the Upfront Payment in amounts to be agreed upon between the parties prior to each such payment being made. Under the Cannabis Licensing Agreement, the Upfront Payments must be paid in full by no later than June 30, 2015. The parties amended the Cannabis Licensing Agreement twice pursuant to which the balance of the Upfront Payment is to be paid by June 30, 2016. We have paid the Upfront Payment of $2,000,000 in full.

&#160;

The Cannabis Licensing Agreement requires us to pay Austrianova, pursuant to a manufacturing agreement to be entered into between the parties, a one-time manufacturing setup fee in the amount of $800,000, of which 50% is required to be paid on the signing of a manufacturing agreement for a product and 50% is required to be paid three months later. In addition, the Cannabis Licensing Agreement requires us to pay a manufacturing production fee, which is to be defined in the manufacturing agreement, for producing the final encapsulated cell product of $800 per vial of 300 capsules after production with a minimum purchased batch size of 400 vials of any Cell-in-a-Box &#174; product. All costs for encapsulated cell products, the manufacturing setup fee and the manufacturing production fee will be subject to annual increases according to the inflation rate in the country in which the encapsulated cell products are manufactured.

&#160;

The Cannabis Licensing Agreement requires us to make future royalty and milestone payments as follows:

&#160;

&#183; Ten percent royalty of the gross sale of all products sold by us; &#160;

&#183; Twenty percent royalty of the amount actually received by us from sub-licensees on sub-licensees&#8217; gross sales value; and &#160;

&#183; Milestone payments of $100,000 within 30 days of beginning the first pre-clinical experiments using the encapsulated cells; $500,000 within 30 days after enrollment of the first human patient in the first clinical trial; $800,000 within 30 days after enrollment of the first human patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial; and $1,000,000 within 90 days after having a NDA or a BLA approved by the FDA or a MAA approved in Europe or its equivalent based on the country in which it is accepted for each product. &#160;

The license under the Cannabis Licensing Agreement may be terminated and all rights will revert to Austrianova if any of the following milestone events do not occur within the following timeframes:

&#160;

&#183; If we do not enter into a research program involving the scope of the license within three years of December 1, 2014, the effective date of the Cannabis Licensing Agreement; or &#160;

&#183; If we do not enter into a clinical trial or its equivalent for a product within 7 years of the effective date of the Cannabis Licensing Agreement &#160;

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

&#160;

The entire encapsulation process relating to the encapsulation of the cells for the oncology and diabetes based treatment is to be carried out by Austrianova. It is responsible for acquiring the necessary raw materials including the cellulose sulfate necessary for encapsulating the live cells. As mentioned above, we have engaged ViruSure to clone new cells from a selected clone. Those clones will be grown to populate a MCB and WCB for our future clinical trials.

Employees

&#160;

As of April 30, 2016, we had four full-time employees and three consultants who function as our Chief Scientific Officer, our Director of Diabetes Program Development and the Chairman of our Advisory Board. We use consulting scientists, physicians, academics and other professionals for the majority of our research, clinical development and operations.

&#160;

Medical and Scientific Advisors

&#160;

We have established our Advisory Board. We regularly seek advice and input from these experienced clinical leaders on matters related to our research and development programs. The members of our Advisory Board consist of experts across a range of key disciplines relevant to our programs. We intend to continue to leverage the broad expertise of our advisors by seeking their counsel on important topics relating to our product development and clinical development programs. Our Advisory Board members are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours. All of the members of our Advisory Board are affiliated with other entities and devote only a small portion of their time to us.

We operate globally and are attempting to develop products in multiple countries. Consequently, we face complex legal and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions, which may expose us to certain financial and other risks.

&#183; greater difficulty in overseeing foreign operations; &#160;

&#183; logistical and communications challenges; &#160;

&#183; potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices, including export license requirements, trade barriers, tariffs and tax laws; &#160;

&#183; burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws; &#160;

&#183; political and economic instability; &#160;

&#183; increases in duties and taxation; &#160;

&#183; foreign tax laws and potential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures; &#160;

&#183; greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property; &#160;

&#183; the risk of third party disputes over ownership of intellectual property and infringement of third party intellectual property by our product candidates; and &#160;

&#183; general social, economic and political conditions in these foreign markets. &#160;
