 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Company 

&#160; 

Pulse Evolution Corporation (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on May 31, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name QurApps, Inc. On May 8, 2014, we changed our name to Pulse Evolution Corporation to better reflect our plans to produce high impact applications of hyper-realistic computer-generated human likeness. 

&#160; 

We are a market leader in the emerging virtual human likeness space, and the foremost developer of hyper-realistic digital humans &#8211; computer generated assets that appear to be human and can perform in live shows, virtual reality, augmented reality, holographic, 3D stereoscopic, web, mobile, interactive and artificial intelligence applications. 

&#160; 

We believe that digital humans will be ubiquitous in society, culture and industry. In the last decade, hyper-realistic digital humans have performed in movies such as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or on stage such as the virtual performance of a digital Tupac Shakur at the Coachella Valley Music Festival. We expect that, in years to come, digital humans will not only perform for audiences on stage and in film, but they will also represent individual consumers as digital likeness avatars, in realistic and fantasy form, appearing and interacting on the consumer&#8217;s behalf in electronic and mobile communication, social media, video game, virtual reality, and augmented reality. We believe digital humans will ultimately act as a relatable interface for artificial intelligence applications, allow thinking computers and &#8216;bots&#8217; to appear as humans, providing useful information and services to people in diverse industries, such as education, health care, telecommunications, defense, transportation and entertainment. 

&#160; 

Our leadership team is currently focused on applications of digital humans in entertainment. We believe the entertainment industry provides us with attractive near-term opportunities to put digital humans to work in proven performance-oriented business models, while also allowing us to use the visibility of our globally recognized celebrities to showcase our digital human technologies and their applications across other industries. Accordingly, our current business plan is to generate revenues from our digital human representations of three of the world&#8217;s best-known late celebrities &#8211; Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe &#8211; in full length entertainment experiences, brand marketing events and digital products. 

&#160; 

Although we are initially focused on the near-term revenue opportunities of &#8216;virtual performance&#8217; as a new form of entertainment, our principal business is to promote the use of digital humans globally, through our technology and through our applications, across diverse digital age industries. As we believe that market demand for digital humans in entertainment, or virtual performers, is considerably greater than our current capacity to meet such demand, we will remain focused on the production of technology and content to support performances and concert tours related to our leading celebrity properties. During this period of development and launch of our live entertainment business, our plans to develop digital humans for other applications, such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality, will be developed through the establishment of joint ventures with third parties, some of which may be affiliated with related parties, that can be separately funded and staffed appropriately to support such opportunities. In 2015, we created one such joint venture, Pulse Biologic, to focus on digital human animation in the surgical simulation and life sciences industries. In 2016, we plan to create a joint venture with a related party to explore the use of digital humans in artificial intelligence. 

&#160; 

Media and Entertainment Business 

&#160; 

Pulse Entertainment produced a computer-generated and animated human likeness of the late popular entertainer Michael Jackson that appeared in a live performance at the Billboard Music Awards on May 18, 2014. The virtual performance of Michael Jackson contributed to the award show&#8217;s highest television viewership in 13 years and an 11-year high in advertising in the demographic of viewers aged 18 to 49. This production reached approximately 11 million television viewers during the initial network broadcast, followed by more than 51 million online views through YouTube and Vevo, more than 2,400 news articles, an estimated 98 billion internet impressions for the Michael Jackson hologram, and more than 300 million internet impressions estimated for Pulse Entertainment and members of its management. 

&#160; 

Our media and entertainment business model is focused on participation in intellectual property through the development, production and co-ownership of entertainment properties featuring globally recognized animated virtual performers and through multiyear revenue share relationships with living celebrities and late celebrity estates. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

While we intend to fund a portion of our production costs from internal sources, we anticipate that a large portion of these costs will be funded by third parties, including affiliated production companies, associated celebrity estates, corporate sponsors and other entertainment finance vehicles. We believe there is significant interest from third-parties to finance theatrical productions related to our leading celebrity properties. It is our goal to utilize such third-party capital to reduce the risks associated with our entertainment business model and position our company to be paid, as much as possible, as a celebrity or as a producer. 

&#160; 

Elvis Presley 

&#160; 

In August 2014, we entered into a multiyear agreement with an affiliate of Authentic Brands Group, ABG EPE IP, LLC (&#8220;ABG&#8221;), the principal owner of rights related to the estate of the late celebrity Elvis Presley to produce a photorealistic digital likeness of the late celebrity and to participate in a share of revenues that could be realized through performances of the &#8220;Virtual Elvis Presley&#8221; in diverse entertainment and media applications. In January 2016 the Agreement was amended, and supplemented with additional agreements, granting to Pulse certain production rights related to a specific concert production and extending the rights of exclusivity through the full term of the Agreement to December 31, 2021. 

&#160; 

In January 2016, we officially began production of our first live concert, featuring a digital Elvis Presley, which will be produced by Simon Fuller and his company XIX Entertainment. Mr. Fuller, noted by Billboard magazine as the most successful British music manager of all time, created the British TV hit Pop Idol, American Idol and the global Idol franchise, which has since garnered 6.5 billion viewers to become the world&#8217;s most widely watched television franchise . He also manages, or has managed, such iconic acts as the Spice Girls, the late Amy Winehouse, Annie Lennox, Carrie Underwood, Steven Tyler, Kelly Clarkson, Lisa Marie Presley, Victoria Beckham and David Beckham. 

&#160; 

Michael Jackson 

&#160; 

In late 2013, Pulse Entertainment Corporation (&#8220;Pulse Entertainment&#8221;), now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an exclusive multiyear agreement with the estate of Michael Jackson to produce a photorealistic digital likeness of the late celebrity and to participate in a share of revenues that could be realized through performances of the &#8220;Virtual Michael Jackson&#8221; in diverse entertainment and media applications. 

&#160; 

Marilyn Monroe 

&#160; 

In October 2014, we entered into a multiyear agreement with the estate of the late celebrity Marilyn Monroe to produce a photorealistic digital likeness of the late celebrity and to participate in a share of revenues that could be realized through performances of the &#8220;Virtual Marilyn Monroe&#8221; in diverse entertainment and media applications. 

&#160; 

In January 2016, the Agreement was amended, extending the rights of exclusivity through the full term of the Agreement to December 31, 2021 and, at the election of Pulse, a renewal option to December 31, 2024. 

&#160; 

Interactive, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mobile Experiences 

&#160; 

On February 26 2016, we entered into an agreement to purchase 100% of the share capital of Float Hybrid Entertainment, Inc., a developer of interactive experiences for brands such as Pepsi, Microsoft, GE, AKQA, Ericsson, XBOX and Anheuser-Busch. Float was also a founding developer on the Kinect depth sensor platform and an experienced developer responsible for a number of yet-to-be-released Virtual and Augmented Reality Platforms. 

&#160; 

We believe that Float&#8217;s practical experience with creating real-time interactive experiences on a wide range of emerging platforms combined with Pulse&#8217;s market leading digital human technology has positioned us to be a leading pioneer in the delivery of digital human experiences to a wide range of brands and customers, especially in the virtual and augmented reality arena. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Artificial Intelligence 

&#160; 

We are actively seeking strategic partners and technology licensing relationships with leading developers of artificial intelligence technologies. It is our goal to be the &#8220;face&#8221; of artificial intelligence, to provide a human form to interactive artificially intelligent computer beings that will be common in society, providing useful information and services to people in diverse industries, such as education, health care, telecommunications, defense, transportation and entertainment. We believe the experience and vision of our leadership team, combined with existing and growing business relationships, have positioned the Company to be a pioneer in the development of consumer facing artificial intelligence applications. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Live Virtual Performances of Animated Human Characters 

&#160; 

A selection of significant live virtual performances members of our team have taken part in include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Virtual 2Pac - a digital resurrection and holograph-like performance of the late rapper Tupac Shakur in front of a live audience at the Coachella Valley Music Festival in 2012. The event was seen by more than 100 million viewers over YouTube in the weeks to follow, inspiring a dramatic rise in Tupac music downloads, the reappearance of Tupac in Billboard&#8217;s Top Album charts and demand across the worldwide press for the digital return of many other late celebrities&#894; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The Michael Jackson Experience at the Billboard Music Awards - a digital resurrection of Michael Jackson, performing a new posthumously released song, &#8216;Slave to the Rhythm&#8217;, along with roughly two dozen virtual projection dancers, live dancers and live band members, in a largescale holographic-like performance in front of a live audience at the globally broadcast 2014 Billboard Music Awards show. The event was seen by more than 11 million television viewers, 40 million viewers over YouTube and Vevo, resulting in 2,400 news articles and roughly 98 billion internet impressions. &#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets, proprietary methodologies and our brand. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, and we rigorously control access to our work and methods. 

&#160; 

Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. 

&#160; 

Marketing Strategy to Support Productions and Secure New Digital Rights 

&#160; 

We intend to achieve sales growth with lower marketing expense by way of two distinct advantages, the uniqueness of our offerings as pioneers of a significant emerging industry and the close relationships, forged over many years, with the small number of large studios, important venues and globally recognized late celebrities that have dominated the entertainment industry. 

&#160; 

Marketing for our productions will include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Align with the most important producers, venue owners and operators in the leading performance markets around the globe, to assure potential production partners and celebrities that we offer unmatched access to the largest audiences &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Actively promote Pulse Entertainment&#8217;s ability to attract the leading talent in facial animation, head replacement and overall human effects, as necessary to convince celebrities and celebrity estates of superior quality in digital likeness &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Communicate all of the above through consistent, high-volume public relations efforts to fully establish and maintain Pulse Entertainment&#8217;s reputation as pioneer and market leader in the global press &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Immediate, and ongoing, outreach to the agents and managers of leading celebrity estates, asserting the above, to assert that the company is the obvious (if not the only) choice as a partner in the exploitation of the new industry of virtual performance and digital resurrection &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Leverage the success from early celebrity appearances to catalyze tremendous demand from venues seeking this new form of entertainment. &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

We also plan to promote our company as the ideal partner for celebrity estates and owners of likeness rights by focusing on the following strategies to achieve ownership of intellectual property or long-term license rights related to music and digital likeness: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Advancement of Legal Standards: We plan to continue working with entertainment counsel to establish the standards, legal definitions and preferred language relating to &#8216;Digital Likeness Rights&#8217;, a concept that our principals have introduced into an industry wide discussion as a result of their pioneering leadership in virtual performances. The advancement of this topic not only positions the company as a market leader in a new form of entertainment, but the creation of new &#8216;rights real estate&#8217; which we believe will enable the company to secure multiple long-term digital likeness licenses (with leading celebrity estates) well before future competitors have even focused on the existence of such rights. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Actionable Production Proposals: Communication with managers and agents regarding specific virtual performance ideas (concerts, shows, etc.) as a way to accelerate the discussion of rights and the successful licensing of such rights to the company. In short, celebrity estates want royalty revenues from these breakthrough new performances and the company is one of the only options they have to move forward. We believe that this position can be leveraged to secure long-term digital likeness rights of the major celebrity properties before competitors enter the field. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Offer to Invest: As it is clear that most celebrity estates are interested in royalty inflows, we will offer to invest in the construction of 3D models and the assets supportive of digital likeness as a means to achieve long-term license rights. We believe there are multiple sources of capital, possibly a company affiliated side fund that will help to develop these assets. &#160; 

Our intellectual property strategies will be to obtain digital likeness rights for the leading celebrity estates prior to its competitors who are not prepared to enter the market. Most managers, agents and attorneys for celebrity estates have not thought deeply and specifically about this new category of rights exploitation. We are generating the interest celebrity managers, agents and attorneys who are not aware of this new category of rights exploitation that have the potential for new revenue streams. We believe that securing these intellectual property rights early on will give it a competitive advantage in the market. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We have positioned ourselves as a producer of high impact applications of computer-generated human likeness, or functional hyper-realistic digital humans. Our competition in the general visual effects services market includes Industrial Light and Magic (purchased by Disney), Sony Pictures Imageworks Inc., Weta Digital Ltd., Rhythm &#38; Hues Inc. and Framestore CFC, as well as many smaller firms that specialize in visual effects for film and TV productions. Many of these producers are larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we do, although they generally operate on a work-for-hire basis and are not directly involved in the production and financing of their projects. 

&#160; 

We believe we can compete effectively with generalist visual effects industry competitors through specialization, developing the highest quality and consistency of digital human likeness, and by being a proven executive producer of large scale live shows and events. We also believe that our long-term exclusive relationships with unique, globally recognized celebrity properties help to further mitigate the risk of competition from other technology companies that may seek to enter the emerging industries of human likeness and virtual performance. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, we employed 35 full-time employees. We believe that our employee and labor relations are good. We are currently not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulations, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History 

&#160; 

Pulse Evolution Corporation was incorporated on May 31, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name QurApps, Inc.

We are not required to register the Common Stock if registration is effected by us on behalf of another shareholder that is exercising registration rights that prohibit registration of other securities or the Common Stock has already been registered. 

&#160;

&#160;
