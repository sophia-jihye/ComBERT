 Item 1. Business 

GENERAL 

SandRidge Energy, Inc. is an energy company engaged in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. The Company&#8217;s primary area of operation is the Mid-Continent in Oklahoma and Kansas. The Company owns and operates additional interests in west Texas and acquired properties located in the Rockies in Colorado in December 2015. Additionally, the Company owned interests in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast until February 2014, as discussed under &#8220;2014 Divestiture&#8221; below. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 4,411 &#32;gross ( 3,371.7 &#32;net) producing wells, a substantial portion of which it operates, and approximately 2,063,000 &#32;gross ( 1,476,000 &#32;net) total acres under lease. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had four rigs drilling in the Mid-Continent. Total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 &#32;were 324.6 &#32;MMBoe, of which approximately 80% &#32;were proved developed. 

The Company also operates businesses and infrastructure systems that are complementary to its primary exploration and production activities, including gas gathering and processing facilities, marketing operations, a saltwater gathering and disposal system and an electrical transmission system. Additionally, until January 2016, the Company operated a drilling and related oilfield services business. 

The Company&#8217;s principal executive offices are located at 123 Robert S. Kerr Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73102 and the Company&#8217;s telephone number is (405) 429-5500.

Business Strategy 

SandRidge&#8217;s mission is to become a high-return, growth-oriented resource conversion company focused in the Mid-Continent and Rockies regions of the United States. In pursuit of its mission, the Company focuses on the following strategies: 

Complementary Operating Areas. The Company&#8217;s primary areas of operation are the Mid-Continent area of Oklahoma and Kansas and the Niobrara Shale in the Colorado Rockies. In the Mid-Continent, the Company is able to (i) increase its technical expertise that it has developed as one of the most active drillers and operators in the region and leverage that expertise in the interpretation of geological and operational opportunities, (ii) achieve economies of scale and breadth of operations, both of which help to control costs, (iii) take advantage of investments in infrastructure including electrical delivery and saltwater gathering and disposal systems and (iv) opportunistically grow its holdings through acquisitions, farmouts and operations in this area to achieve production and reserve growth. With the recent acquisition of Rockies acreage and assets in Colorado&#8217;s North Park Basin, the Company intends to develop a proven oil resource play similar to that being developed in Colorado&#8217;s DJ Basin, both areas drawing from the oil rich Niobrara Shale. In the Rockies, the Company intends to apply its core competencies in developing medium depth formations and deploy its expertise in multi-stage fracture stimulation, artificial lift and extended and multi-lateral wellbore designs. Additionally, as operator of a majority of its wells, the Company has flexibility to utilize these competitive advantages to deliver strong, sustainable returns. 

Preservation of Capital in Depressed Commodity Pricing Environment. Volatility of pricing can significantly impact the amount of revenue received for oil and natural gas production and the level of economic returns the Company receives for amounts invested in its exploration and development activities. Over time, costs to drill, complete and operate wells typically adjust to prevailing commodity price levels, resulting in improved and more certain returns; however, during periods of depressed oil and natural gas pricing, such as that which began during the second half of 2014 and is continuing, the Company preserves capital and liquidity by contracting its capital expenditures budget and high-grading locations for development. During such times, the Company capitalizes on in place infrastructure, such as the Company&#8217;s saltwater gathering and disposal and electrical systems, by focusing drilling efforts on locations that can most effectively make use of this existing infrastructure. Additionally, exploration programs are conducted within a high-graded inventory of locations that have a greater certainty of economic returns. The Company&#8217;s 2016 capital expenditures budget is approximately $285.0 million , with approximately $ 262.0 million &#32;designated for exploration and production activities. 

Focus on Cost Efficiency and Capital Allocation . By leveraging its experienced workforce, scalable operational structure and infrastructure systems, the Company is able to achieve cost efficiencies and sustainable returns in the Mid-Continent and Niobrara Shale in the Rockies. In the Mid-Continent, with a focus on lower-risk, high rate of return and repeatable drilling opportunities with long economic lives, the Company has made improvements in its multi-lateral wellbore designs, its completion designs, well site production facilities, utilization of pad drilling, its vendor contracts and spud-to-spud cycle time to further reduce its cost structure in the Mid-Continent. Further, due to the low pressure and shallow characteristics of the reservoirs the Company develops, the Company is able to maintain a low-cost operating structure and manage service costs. Similar opportunities exist in the development of the Niobrara Shale in the Rockies, where technologies developed in the Mid-Continent are transferable. The ability to drill multiple laterals from a single pad or single vertical wellbore is expected to facilitate cost-effective development of this oil rich resource play. 

Mitigate Commodity Price Risk . As appropriate, the Company enters into derivative contracts to mitigate a portion of the commodity price volatility inherent in the oil and natural gas industry. By increasing the predictability of cash inflows for a portion of its future production, the Company is better able to mitigate funding risks for its longer term development plans and lock-in rates of return on its capital projects. 

Develop Key Infrastructure Systems. By constructing a saltwater gathering and disposal system and electrical delivery system to service its Mid-Continent properties, the Company is able to produce oil and natural gas more efficiently and, therefore, more economically, giving it a competitive advantage over other operators in this rural area. Expertise developed by the Company in planning and executing large scale infrastructure and midstream projects in the Mid-Continent is being directly applied to the development of the Niobrara Shale. 

Maintain Flexibility. The Company has multi-year inventories of both oil and natural gas drilling locations within its core operating area. Maintaining inventories of both oil and natural gas drilling locations allows the Company to efficiently direct capital toward projects with the most attractive returns. 

Pursue Opportunistic Acquisitions . The Company periodically reviews acquisition targets to complement its existing asset base. The Company selectively identifies such targets based on several factors including relative value, hydrocarbon mix and location, and the relative fit of the Company&#8217;s core competencies and technical expertise and, when appropriate, seeks to acquire them at a discount to other opportunities. 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

2016 Divestiture and Release from Treating Agreement 

On January 21, 2016, the Company transferred ownership of substantially all of its oil and natural gas properties and midstream assets located in the Pi&#241;on field in the West Texas Overthrust (&#8220;WTO&#8221;) and $11.0 million in cash to a wholly owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (&#8220;Occidental&#8221;) and was released from all past, current and future claims and obligations under an existing 30-year treating agreement between the companies. For the year ended December 31, 2015, production, revenues and direct operating expenses for the conveyed oil and natural gas properties were 1.9 MMBoe, $14.6 million and $41.1 million, respectively. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company accrued approximately $34.9 million &#32;in penalties related to the Company&#8217;s shortfall in meeting its 2015 annual CO 2 &#32;delivery requirement under the 30-year treating agreement that was terminated in accordance with the terms of the transaction. 

The assets of Pi&#241;on Gathering Company, LLC (&#8220;PGC&#8221;), which were acquired by the Company in October 2015 as discussed further below, were included in the consideration conveyed to Occidental. 

2015 Acquisitions 

Pi&#241;on Gathering Company, LLC . In October 2015, the Company acquired the assets of and terminated a gas gathering agreement with PGC for $48.0 million &#32;in cash and $78.0 million &#32;principal amount of newly issued 8.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2020 (&#8220;Senior Secured Notes&#8221;). PGC owns approximately 370 miles of gathering lines supporting the natural gas production from the Company's Pi&#241;on field in the WTO. &#160; 

Rockies Properties - North Park Basin. &#32;In December 2015, the Company acquired approximately 135,000 &#32;net acres in the North Park Basin, Jackson County, Colorado for approximately $191.1 million &#32;in cash, including post-closing adjustments. Also included in the acquisition were working interests in 16 wells previously drilled on the acreage. Additionally, the seller paid the Company $3.1 million for certain overriding interests retained in the properties. 

2014 Divestiture 

Sale of Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast Properties. &#32;On February 25, 2014, the Company sold certain of its subsidiaries that owned the Company&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast oil and natural gas properties (collectively, the &#8220;Gulf Properties&#8221;), to Fieldwood Energy, LLC (&#8220;Fieldwood&#8221;) for $702.6 million , net of working capital adjustments and post-closing adjustments, and Fieldwood&#8217;s assumption of approximately $366.0 million &#32;of related asset retirement obligations. The Company used the proceeds from the sale to fund its drilling in the Mid-Continent. Additionally, the Company settled a portion of its existing oil derivative contracts in January and February 2014 prior to their respective maturities to reduce volumes hedged in proportion to the anticipated reduction in daily production volumes due to the sale, which resulted in the Company making cash payments of approximately $69.6 million. The Company retained a 2% overriding royalty interest in certain exploration prospects. 

&#32;In accordance with the terms of the sale, the Company agreed to guarantee on behalf of the buyer certain plugging and abandonment obligations associated with the Gulf Properties for a period of up to one year from the date of closing. Additionally, the buyer agreed to indemnify the Company for any costs it may incur as a result of the guarantee. The Company did not incur any costs as a result of this guarantee, and was released from the obligation during the third quarter of 2015. 

2013 Divestiture 

Sale of Permian Properties. &#32;On February 26, 2013, the Company sold its oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin area of west Texas, excluding the assets associated with the SandRidge Permian Trust area of mutual interest (the &#8220;Permian Properties&#8221;) for net proceeds of $2.6 billion , including post-closing adjustments that were finalized in the third quarter of 2013. The Company used a portion of the sale proceeds to fund the redemption of approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior notes and used the remaining proceeds to fund capital expenditures in the Mid-Continent and for general corporate purposes. Including final post-closing adjustments, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on the sale of $398.9 million , of which $71.7 million &#32;was allocated to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, the Company settled a portion of its existing oil derivative contracts in February 2013 prior to their contractual maturities to reduce volumes hedged in proportion to the anticipated reduction in daily production volumes due to the sale, which resulted in a loss on settlement of approximately $ 29.6 million . 

PRIMARY BUSINESS OPERATIONS 

The Company&#8217;s dominant segment is its exploration and production business, which explores for, develops and produces oil and natural gas. Financial information for this segment and the Company&#8217;s two other reportable business segments, the drilling and oilfield services and midstream services segments, is provided in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Note 23 &#8212;Business Segment Information&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.

Properties 

Mid-Continent 

The Company held interests in approximately 1,826,000 gross ( 1,273,000 &#32;net) leasehold acres primarily in Oklahoma and Kansas at December 31, 2015 . Associated proved reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;totaled 259.1 &#32;MMBoe, 85% of which were proved developed reserves, based on estimates prepared by Cawley, Gillespie &#38; Associates, Inc., (&#8220;CG&#38;A&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s internal engineers. The Company&#8217;s interests in the Mid-Continent as of December 31, 2015 &#32;included 2,386 &#32;gross ( 1,392.2 &#32;net) producing wells with an average working interest of 59%. The Company had four &#32;rigs operating in the Mid-Continent as of December 31, 2015 , all of which were drilling horizontal wells. The Company drilled a total of 165 wells in this area during 2015, of which 161 were horizontal wells and four were saltwater disposal wells. 

Mississippian Formation. A key target for exploration and development within the Mid-Continent area is the Mississippian formation, which is an expansive carbonate hydrocarbon system located on the Anadarko Shelf in northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas. The top of this formation is encountered between approximately 4,000 and 7,000 feet and lies stratigraphically between various formations of Pennsylvanian age and the Devonian-aged Woodford Shale formation. The Mississippian formation can reach 1,000 feet in gross thickness and have targeted porosity zone(s) ranging between 20 and 150 feet in thickness. At December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately 1,732,000 gross (1,218,000 net) acres under lease in the Mississippian formation. 

The Company has drilled approximately 1,675 wells in this formation as of December 31, 2015 . From December 31, 2014 &#32;to December 31, 2015 , the number of the Company&#8217;s producing horizontal wells in the Mississippian formation increased from 1,555 to 1,726. Of the wells the Company drilled in the Mississippian formation during 2015, three wells are subject to the royalty interests of the Mississippian Trust II. The Company fulfilled its drilling obligation to the Mississippian Trust II in March 2015. 

Other Formations. The Company drilled 23 wells in the Chester formation and eight wells in the Woodford formation in 2015 in order to determine commerciality and initiate development of these productive formations. 

&#32; Historically drilled with vertical wells, the Chester formation in the Northern Mid-Continent is currently being targeted for horizontal development. The formation, which lies beneath various Pennsylvanian-aged formations and above the Mississippian formation, is composed of stacked low permeability sandstone and carbonate layers interbedded with shale. The top of the formation occurs at about 5,600 feet and ranges in thickness from less than 100 to over 1,000 feet. Individual target zones within the formation range from 15 to 50 feet in thickness. 

Long regarded as the primary source rock for most Mid-Continent reservoirs, the Woodford formation is now itself being developed horizontally across much of Oklahoma. This Devonian-aged formation, which lies beneath the Mississippian formation and above various Lower Paleozoic formations, is stratigraphically equivalent to the Marcellus Shale in the 

Appalachian Basin and the Bakken Shale in the Williston Basin. It is composed of alternating layers of organic-rich shale and less organic-rich siliceous or carbonate-rich shale. The top of the formation in the exploration and development area ranges from 6,200 to 10,000 feet, and the thickness of the formation ranges from less than 50 to over 100 feet. 

Gathering and Disposal and Electrical Systems. The Company&#8217;s electrical infrastructure, owned by the Company&#8217;s midstream services segment, and saltwater gathering and disposal system assist in the economically efficient production of oil and natural gas in the Mid-Continent. The Company&#8217;s electrical infrastructure, which consisted of approximately 1,122 miles of power lines and seven substations at December 31, 2015 , coordinates the delivery of electricity to the Company&#8217;s Mid-Continent operations at a lower cost than electricity provided by on-site generation. Additionally, by building its own infrastructure in these rural areas, the Company has been able to provide sufficient electricity to its operations. The Company is also able to obtain lower electrical rates based on aggregated volumes. The saltwater gathering and disposal system, which included more than 150 active wells and approximately 1,150 miles of gathering lines at December 31, 2015 , reduces the overall cost of water disposal, which directly reduces production costs. The system has a current injection capacity of over 2.0 million barrels of water per day. 

Rockies 

The Company acquired its Rockies assets, located in the North Park Basin in Jackson County, Colorado, in December 2015. At December 31, 2015, the properties consisted of approximately 149,000 &#32;gross ( 135,000 &#32;net) acres and operated working interests in 16 previously drilled producing wells with an average working interest of 100%. Associated proved reserves at December 31, 2015 were approximately 27.6 &#32;MMBoe, of which approximately 6% were proved developed reserves. The Rockies acreage is located within the Niobrara Shale play. The Niobrara Shale is characterized by numerous stacked pay reservoirs at depths of 5,500 to 9,000 feet with reservoir thickness over 450 feet. 

West Texas 

The Company&#8217;s west Texas oil and natural gas properties include properties in the WTO and the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s west Texas properties consisted of approximately 88,000 gross ( 68,000 &#32;net) leasehold acres, 2,009 &#32;gross ( 1,963.5 &#32;net) producing wells with an average working interest of 98%. Associated proved reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;were 37.9 &#32;MMBoe, 100% of which were proved developed reserves. The Company did not drill any wells in this area during 2015. 

As discussed in &#8220;2016 Divestiture and Release from Treating Agreement&#8221; above, the Company divested its WTO oil and natural gas properties in January 2016. Also, under the terms of the transaction, the Company was released from its past, current and future obligations under a 30-year treating agreement pursuant to which (i) the Company delivered natural gas produced in the WTO to Occidental&#8217;s CO 2 &#32;treatment plant in Pecos County, Texas (the &#8220;Century Plant&#8221;) and (ii) Occidental removed CO 2 &#32;from natural gas volumes delivered by the Company. The Company retained all methane gas after treatment. Under the agreement, the Company was required to deliver a total of approximately 3,200 &#32;Bcf of CO 2 &#32;during the agreement period. The Company was obligated to pay Occidental $0.25 &#32;per Mcf to the extent minimum annual CO 2 &#32;volume requirements were not met and $0.70 &#32;per Mcf to the extent the total contract delivery requirement was not met by the end of the contract term. 

Proved Reserves 

Preparation of &#32; Reserves Estimates 

The estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves in this report are based on reserve reports, the substantial majority of which were prepared by independent petroleum engineers. To achieve reasonable certainty, the Company&#8217;s engineers relied on technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used to estimate the Company&#8217;s proved reserves include, but are not limited to, well logs, geological maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information and property ownership interests. This data was reviewed by various levels of management for accuracy, before consultation with independent petroleum engineers. Such consultation included review of properties, assumptions and any new data available. The Corporate Reservoir department&#8217;s internal reserves estimates and methodologies were compared to those prepared by independent petroleum engineers to test the reserves estimates and conclusions before the reserves estimates were included in this report. The accuracy of the reserve estimates is dependent on many factors, including the following: 

&#8226; 

the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data; 

&#8226; 

estimates regarding the amount and timing of future costs, which could vary considerably from actual costs; 

&#8226; 

the accuracy of economic assumptions such as the future price of oil and natural gas; and 

&#8226; 

the judgment of the personnel preparing the estimates. 

SandRidge&#8217;s Senior Vice President&#8212;Corporate Reservoir Engineering is the technical professional primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the Company&#8217;s reserves estimates. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering with over 30 years of practical industry experience, including over 30 years of estimating and evaluating reserve information. He has also been a certified professional engineer in the state of Oklahoma since 2007 and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers since 1980. 

SandRidge&#8217;s Reservoir Engineering Department continually monitors asset performance, making reserves estimate adjustments, as necessary, to ensure the most current reservoir information is reflected in reserves estimates. Reserve information includes production histories as well as other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data. The Corporate Reservoir department currently has a total of 20 full-time employees, comprised of 11 degreed engineers and nine engineering and business analysts with a minimum of a four-year degree in mathematics, finance or other business or science field. 

The Company maintains a continuous education program for its engineers and analysts on new technologies and industry advancements and also offers refresher training on basic skill sets. 

In order to ensure the reliability of reserves estimates, internal controls within the reserve estimation process include: 

&#8226; 

no employee&#8217;s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves recorded. 

&#8226; 

reserves estimates are prepared by experienced reservoir engineers or under their direct supervision. 

&#8226; 

the Senior Vice President&#8212;Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to the Company&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer. 

&#8226; 

the Reservoir Engineering Department follows comprehensive SEC-compliant internal policies to determine and report proved reserves including: 

&#8226; 

confirming that reserves estimates include all properties owned and are based upon proper working and net revenue interests; 

&#8226; 

reviewing and using in the estimation process data provided by other departments within the Company such as Accounting; and 

&#8226; 

comparing and reconciling the Corporate Reservoir department&#8217;s internally generated reserves estimates to those prepared by third parties. 

Each quarter, the Senior Vice President&#8212;Corporate Reservoir Engineering presents the status of the Company&#8217;s reserves to a committee of executives, which subsequently approves all changes. 

The Reservoir Engineering Department works closely with its independent petroleum consultants at each fiscal year end to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of annual independent reserves estimates. These independently developed reserves estimates are reviewed by the Audit Committee, as well as the Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Accounting, Director of Internal Audit, Vice President of Financial Reporting and General Counsel and are approved as the Company&#8217;s corporate reserves. In addition to reviewing the independently developed reserve reports, the Audit Committee annually meets with the principal engineers who are primarily responsible for the reserve reports. The Audit Committee also periodically meets with the other independent petroleum consultants that prepare estimates of proved reserves.

Technologies &#32; 

Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible, based on prices used to estimate reserves, from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence 

indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. The term &#8220;reasonable certainty&#8221; implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil, natural gas and/or NGLs actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil, natural gas or NGLs on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 

Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. In determining the amount of proved reserves, the price used must be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the reserve report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

The estimates of proved developed reserves included in the reserve report were prepared using decline curve analysis to determine the reserves of individual producing wells. After estimating the reserves of each proved developed well, it was determined that a reasonable level of certainty exists with respect to the reserves that can be expected from close offset undeveloped wells in the field. 

Development Plan 

Based on the economic conditions on December 31, 2015, the Company approved of a plan to develop the proved undeveloped locations identified in the Company&#8217;s reserve report within five years of initial booking, in accordance with SEC regulations. The reserve report anticipated a three rig drilling program for the first half of 2016 and four rigs in the second half of the year. Two rigs were scheduled to drill primarily proved undeveloped locations in the first half of 2016, increasing to three rigs in the second half of the year. 

&#160; 

However, persistently low commodity prices through the first quarter of 2016 have negatively impacted the Company&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and future development plans. As a result, the Company intends to scale back to a two rig drilling program beginning in the second quarter of 2016. If commodity pricing falls short of the Company&#8217;s current expectations or rebounds to a level supportive of more drilling, the Company may change its 2016 capital expenditure plans again. However, the Company&#8217;s management does not expect these short term changes to negatively impact the Company&#8217;s ability to develop all of its December 31, 2015 proved undeveloped locations within the five year time frame described above, nor does it expect such changes to have a significant impact to the Company&#8217;s overall development plan or PV-10 as presented in the Company&#8217;s December 31, 2015 reserve report. 

Reporting of Natural Gas Liquids 

NGLs are produced as a result of the processing of a portion of the Company&#8217;s natural gas production stream. At December 31, 2015 , NGLs comprised approximately 19% of the Company&#8217;s total proved reserves on a barrel equivalent basis 

and represented volumes to be produced from properties where the Company has contracts in place for the extraction and separate sale of NGLs. NGLs are products sold by the gallon. In reporting proved reserves and production of NGLs, the Company has included production and reserves in barrels. The extraction of NGLs in the processing of natural gas reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale. All production information related to natural gas is reported net of the effect of any reduction in natural gas volumes resulting from the processing and extraction of NGLs. 

Reserve Quantities, PV-10 and Standardized Measure 

The following estimates of proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are based on reserve reports as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the substantial majority of which were prepared by independent petroleum engineers. The estimates include reserves attributable to the Royalty Trusts, including amounts associated with noncontrolling interest. The PV-10 values shown in the table below are not intended to represent the current market value of the Company&#8217;s estimated proved reserves as of the dates shown. The reserve reports were based on the Company&#8217;s drilling schedule and the average price during the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , using first-day-of-the-month prices for each month. Such prices are not reflective of actual prices at December 31, 2015 &#32;or current prices. See further discussion of prices in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; included in Item 1A of this report. At December 31, 2015 , the Company estimated that approximately 100% of its current proved undeveloped reserves will be developed by the end of 2020. See &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates&#8221; in Item 7 of this report for further discussion of uncertainties inherent to the reserves estimates.

PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, less future development and production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using 12-month average prices for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . PV-10 differs from Standardized Measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. Neither PV-10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of fair market value of the Company&#8217;s oil and natural gas properties. PV-10 is used by the industry and by the Company&#8217;s management as a reserve asset value measure to compare against past reserve bases and the reserve bases of other business entities. It is useful because its calculation is not dependent on the taxpaying status of the entity. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company&#8217;s Standardized Measure to PV-10:

Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, less future development and production costs, and income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions used to calculate PV-10. Standardized Measure differs from PV-10 as Standardized Measure includes the effect of future income taxes. 

Proved Reserves - Mid-Continent . Proved reserves in the Mid-Continent, primarily the Mississippian formation, increased from 302.3 MMBoe at December 31, 2013 to 454.4 MMBoe at December 31, 2014 and decreased to 259.1 &#32;MMBoe at December 31, 2015. The decrease in 2015 is primarily due to negative pricing revisions of approximately 185 MMBoe, predominantly associated with proved undeveloped reserves, and negative revisions of approximately 29 MMBoe due to well performance. These decreases were partially offset by 45 MMBoe of extensions due to successful drilling in the Mississippian formation. The proved reserves attributable to the Mid-Continent comprise a significant portion of the additions to the Company&#8217;s proved reserves for the three-year period. The reserves attributable to more than 1,700 producing wells and continuousness of the formation over the development area further support proved undeveloped classification of selective locations within close proximity to producing wells. 

Proved Reserves - Rockies. The Company&#8217;s proved reserves in the Rockies, associated with the Niobrara Shale in the North Park Basin of Colorado, were acquired in December 2015 and totaled 27.6 MMBoe at December 31, 2015. The acquisition of these reserves provides an important proved reserve addition to the Company&#8217;s asset base. Reservoir characteristics of the Niobrara in the North Park Basin are similar to those of the Niobrara in the DJ Basin to the east of North Park. The reservoir consists of five stacked benches with proved reserves only booked to the D Bench of the Niobrara Shale. Proved developed reserves were booked based on 16 horizontal producing wells drilled in 14 sections across the play. Production performance and reservoir data gathered from the producing wells confirm consistency in reservoir properties such as porosity, thickness and stratigraphic conformity. These wells all encountered proven Niobrara D Bench reserves. Using the performance of the PDP wells, undeveloped reserves were booked for only the D bench of the Niobrara across 27 sections of the proved development area. Although well density in the DJ Basin Niobrara indicates increasing PUD density, the Company has only booked up to four wells per section for only the Niobrara D Bench. 

Proved Reserves - West Texas. &#32;&#32;&#32; In 2015, proved reserves, net of production, decreased by 20.0 MMBoe, primarily due to pricing revisions as a result of significantly lower commodity prices. In 2014, proved reserves decreased by 9 MMBoe, primarily from revisions to proved undeveloped reserves in the Permian Basin, due largely to the removal of proved undeveloped drilling locations not expected to be drilled within a five year period. 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves. &#32;The following table summarizes activity associated with proved undeveloped reserves during the periods presented:

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a decrease in proved undeveloped reserves of 115 MMBoe, primarily due to negative revisions of approximately 147 MMBoe resulting from lower commodity prices. These negative revisions were partially offset by an addition to oil, natural gas and NGL reserves associated with proved undeveloped properties of 48 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2015. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 22 MMBoe, primarily from horizontal drilling in the Mississippian formation in the Mid-Continent, which includes 6 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves booked and converted during 2015. Acquisition of the Rockies assets, located in Jackson County, Colorado, in December 2015 added 26 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves. Approximately 10 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2014 were converted to proved developed reserves during 2015. 

Excluding asset sales, the Company recognized a net addition to oil, natural gas and NGL reserves associated with proved undeveloped properties of 73 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2014. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 67 MMBoe, primarily from horizontal drilling in the Mississippian formation in the Mid-Continent, which includes 10 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves booked and converted during 2014. Net positive revisions of 6 MMBoe were recognized and were comprised of 16 MMBoe in increases from the Mid-Continent primarily from an improved overall Mississippian proved undeveloped type curve, partially offset by negative 10 MMBoe revisions primarily from the removal of Permian Basin proved undeveloped drilling locations not expected to be drilled within a five year period. Approximately 21 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2013 were converted to proved developed reserves during 2014. 

Excluding asset sales, the Company recognized a net addition to oil, natural gas and NGL reserves associated with proved undeveloped properties of 42 MMBoe for the year ended December 31, 2013. Reserves added from extensions and discoveries totaled 67 MMBoe, primarily from horizontal drilling in the Mississippian formation in the Mid-Continent, which includes 10 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves booked and converted during 2013. These additions were offset by downward reserve revisions of 25 MMBoe, primarily from the Mississippian formation, due to the removal of proved undeveloped drilling locations not expected to be drilled within a five year period. These revisions were a result of the Company&#8217;s ongoing efforts to optimize its drilling plan within the Mississippian formation and reevaluating anticipated drilling locations. Approximately 35 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2012 were converted to proved developed reserves during 2013. 

For additional information regarding changes in the Company&#8217;s proved reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;see &#8220;Note 25 &#8212;Supplemental Information on Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.

The following table sets forth information with respect to wells the Company completed during the periods indicated. The information presented is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and should not be interpreted to present any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and quantities or economic value of reserves found. Productive wells are those that produce commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, regardless of whether they produce a reasonable rate of return. Gross wells refer to the total number of wells in which the Company had a working interest and net wells are the sum of the Company&#8217;s fractional working interests owned in gross wells. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 6 gross (3.8 net) operated wells drilling, completing or awaiting completion.

(1) 

Leases remaining in effect until development efforts or production on the developed portion of the particular lease has ceased. 

Included in the acreage due to expire during the twelve months ending December 31, 2016, as presented in the table above, are approximately 556,811 gross (405,648 net) acres in the Mid-Continent area. The Company has options to extend the leases on a portion of this acreage set to expire in the Mid-Continent in 2016 and expects to exercise such options or hold by production portions of such acreage where geological and engineering criteria deem it prudent to do so. 

Marketing and Customers 

The Company sells oil, natural gas and NGLs to a variety of customers, including utilities, oil and natural gas companies and trading and energy marketing companies. The Company had two customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of its total revenue during 2015 . See &#8220;Note 23 &#8212;Business Segment Information&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information on its major customers. The number of readily available purchasers for the Company&#8217;s products makes it unlikely that the loss of a single customer in the areas in which the Company sells its products would materially affect its sales. The Company does not have any material commitments to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of oil and natural gas in the future under existing sales contracts or sales agreements. 

Title to Properties 

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, the Company initially conducts a preliminary review of the title to its properties for which it does not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, the Company conducts a thorough title examination and performs curative work with respect to significant defects. To the extent drilling title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, the Company is typically responsible for curing any title defects at its expense. The Company generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until it has cured any material title defects on such property. In addition, prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases, the Company performs title reviews on the most significant leases, and depending on the materiality of properties, the Company may obtain a drilling title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. To date, the Company has obtained drilling title opinions on substantially all of its producing properties and believes that it has good and defensible title to its producing properties. The Company&#8217;s oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens, which the Company believes do not materially interfere with the use of, or affect its carrying value of, the properties. 

COMPETITION 

The Company believes that its leasehold acreage position, midstream assets, geographic concentration of operations and technical and operational capabilities enable it to compete effectively with other exploration and production operations. However, the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive. 

The Company competes with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for leases, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Many of these competitors are financially stronger than the Company, but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil, 

natural gas and NGLs at any price to maintain cash flow. Certain companies may be able to pay more for producing properties and undeveloped acreage. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil, natural gas and NGL prices. The Company&#8217;s larger or fully integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any future federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than the Company can, which would adversely affect its competitive position. The Company&#8217;s ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future depends on its ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because the Company has fewer financial and human resources than many companies in its industry, the Company may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. 

Oil, natural gas and NGLs compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas and NGLs or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. 

SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS 

Generally, demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit the Company&#8217;s drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of its operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting the Company&#8217;s well drilling objectives, can delay the installation of production facilities, and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during certain times of the year, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay the Company&#8217;s operations. 

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS 

General 

The exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are subject to stringent federal, state, tribal, regional and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, which may cause the Company to incur significant capital and operating expenditures or costly actions to achieve and maintain compliance. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require permits to conduct drilling, water withdrawal and other regulated activities; govern the types, quantities and concentrations of substances that may be disposed or released into the environment and the manner of any such disposal or release; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities or require formal mitigation measures in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions arising from the Company&#8217;s operations or attributable to former operations; impose safety and health restrictions designed to protect employees from exposure to hazardous or dangerous substances; and impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining operations in affected areas. 

&#160; 

The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes or enhanced enforcement of these laws and regulations that result in delays or restrictions in permitting or development of projects or more stringent or costly construction, drilling, water management or completion activities or waste handling, storage, transport, remediation, or disposal emission or discharge requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Moreover, accidental releases, including spills, may occur in the course of the Company&#8217;s operations, and there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury. The Company may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. 

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations, as amended from time to time, applicable to the oil and natural gas industry and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on the Company. 

Hazardous Substances and Wastes 

The Company currently owns, leases, or operates, and in the past has owned, leased, or operated, properties that have been used to explore for and produce oil and natural gas. The Company believes it has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the applicable time, but hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties owned, leased, or operated by the Company or on or under other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes were not under the Company&#8217;s control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and analogous state laws. Under these laws, the Company could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to investigate and clean up contaminated property and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action. 

CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws may impose strict joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release of a hazardous substance occurred as well as entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, these &#8220;responsible persons&#8221; may be liable for the costs of cleaning up sites where the hazardous substances have been released, into the environment, for damages to natural resources resulting from the release and for the costs of certain environmental and health studies. Additionally, landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and natural resource and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment from a hazardous substance release and to pursue steps to recover costs incurred for those actions from responsible parties. Certain products used by the Company in the course of its exploration, development and production operations may be regulated as CERCLA hazardous substances. To date, no Company-owned or operated site has been designated as a Superfund site, and the Company has not been identified as a responsible party for any Superfund site. 

The Company also generates wastes that are subject to the requirements of RCRA and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes strict &#8220;cradle-to-grave&#8221; requirements on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, production and/or development of crude oil and natural gas are currently excluded from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA&#8217;s less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. However, it is possible that these wastes could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in August 2015, several non-governmental organizations filed notice of intent to sue the EPA under RCRA for, among other things, the agency&#8217;s alleged failure to reconsider whether such exclusion should continue to apply. Any change in the exclusion for such wastes could potentially result in an increase in costs to manage and dispose of wastes. In the course of the Company&#8217;s operations, it generates petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that are subject to regulation under the RCRA. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with all regulations regarding the handling and disposal of oil and natural gas wastes from its operations. 

Air Emissions 

The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require the Company to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to acquire such permits has the potential to delay or limit the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, the Company may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the Clean Air Act, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The EPA is required to make attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards by October 1, 2017. With the EPA lowering the ground-level ozone standard, states may be required to implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to the Company&#8217;s operations and result in the need to install new emissions controls, longer permitting timelines and significant increases in the Company&#8217;s capital or operating expenditures. Additionally, violations of lease conditions or regulations related to air emissions can result in civil and criminal 

penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and canceling leases. Such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution. 

Water Discharges 

The Federal Clean Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (the &#8220;CWA&#8221;), and analogous state laws and implementing regulations, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States as well as state waters. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited unless it is permitted by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The Company does not presently discharge pollutants associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas into federal or state waters. The CWA including analogous state laws and regulations also impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of sediment via storm water run-off to waters of the United States and state waters from a wide variety of construction activities. Such activities are generally prohibited from discharging sediment unless it is permitted by the EPA or an analogous state agency. However, pursuant to the Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005, storm water discharges related to oil and gas exploration, development and production and meeting certain conditions are exempt from the permitting provisions of the CWA. The Company employs certain controls with respect to construction activities to address the discharge of sediment into nearby water bodies. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. The EPA issued a final rule in May 2015 that attempts to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States but this rule has been stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as that appellate court and numerous district courts consider lawsuits opposing implementation of the rule. To the extent the rule expands the scope of the CWA&#8217;s jurisdiction, the Company could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. 

Finally, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;), which amends the CWA, establishes standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA requires measures to be taken to prevent the accidental discharge of oil into waters of the United States from onshore production facilities. Measures under the OPA and/or CWA include inspection and maintenance programs to minimize spills from oil storage and conveyance systems: the use of secondary containment systems to prevent spills from reaching nearby water bodies; and the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasure (&#8220;SPCC&#8221;) plans to prevent and respond to oil spills. The Company has developed and implemented SPCC plans for properties as required under the CWA. 

Subsurface Injections 

Underground injection operations performed by the Company are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;), as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control (&#8220;UIC&#8221;) program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate underground injection wells. Although the Company monitors the injection process of its wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of the Company&#8217;s UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Additionally, some states have considered laws mandating the recycling of flowback and produced water. If such laws are adopted in areas where the Company conducts operations, the Company&#8217;s operating costs may increase significantly. 

Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water resulting from oil and natural gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells. For example, in Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) has implemented a variety of measures including adopting the National Academy of Science&#8217;s &#8220;traffic light system,&#8221; pursuant to which the agency reviews new disposal well applications for proximity to faults, seismicity in the area and other factors in determining whether such wells should be permitted, permitted only with special restrictions, or not permitted. The OCC also evaluates existing wells to assess their continued operation, or operation with restrictions, based on location relative to such faults, seismicity and other factors, with certain of such existing wells required to make frequent, or even daily, volume and pressure reports. In addition, the OCC has rules requiring operators of certain saltwater disposal wells in the state to, among other things, conduct mechanical integrity testing or make certain demonstrations of such wells&#8217; depth that, depending on the depth, could require the plugging 

back of such wells and/or the reduction of volumes disposed in such wells. As a result of these measures, the OCC from time to time has developed and implemented plans calling for wells within areas of interest where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations in an attempt to mitigate the occurrence of such incidents. For example, only recently, in January 2016, the OCC ordered five Arbuckle disposal wells within 10 miles of the center of earthquake activity in the Edmond area of Oklahoma to reduce disposal volumes, with wells within 3.5 miles of the activity ordered to reduce disposal volumes by 50 percent while the other wells within 10 miles of the activity were ordered to reduce their disposal volume by 25 percent. In addition, in January 2016, the Governor of Oklahoma announced a grant of $1.38 million in emergency funds to support earthquake research, which research is to be directed by the OCC and the Oklahoma Geological Survey. Further, on February 16, 2016, the OCC issued its largest volume reduction plan to date, covering approximately 5,281 square miles and 245 disposal wells injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation. In the plan, the OCC identified 76 SandRidge operated disposals wells, prescribed a four stage volume reduction schedule and set April 30, 2016 as the final date for compliance with the tiered volume reduction plan. 

Additionally, the Governor of Kansas has established a task force composed of various administrative agencies to study and develop an action plan for addressing seismic activity in the state. The task force issued a recommended Seismic Action Plan calling for enhanced seismic monitoring and the development of a seismic response plan, and in November 2014, the Governor of Kansas announced a plan to enhance seismic monitoring in the state. In March 2015, the Kansas Corporation Commission issued its Order Reducing Saltwater Injection Rates. The Order identified five areas of heightened seismic concern in Harper and Sumner Counties and created a timeframe over which the maximum of 8,000 barrels of saltwater injection daily into each well. SandRidge and other operators of injection wells, and any injection well drilled deeper than the Arbuckle Formation was required to be plugged back in a manner approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission. On September 14, 2015, the Kansas Corporation Commission extended the Order Reducing Saltwater Injection Rates until March 13, 2016. Most recently, in February 2016, the Kansas Corporation Commission staff recommended an expansion of the areas of heightened seismic concern, which would include an additional schedule of volume reductions for Arbuckle disposal wells not previously identified in the Order released in March 2015. 

Evaluation of seismic incidents and whether or to what extent those events are induced by the injection of saltwater into disposal wells continues to evolve, as governmental authorities consider new and/or past seismic incidents in areas where salt water disposal activities occur or are proposed to be performed. The adoption of any new laws, regulations, or directives that restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to dispose of saltwater generated by production and development activities , whether by plugging back the depths of disposal wells, reducing the volume of salt water disposed in such wells, restricting disposal well locations or otherwise, or by requiring SandRidge to shut down disposal wells, could significantly increase SandRidge&#8217;s costs to manage and dispose of this saltwater, which could negatively affect the economic lives of the affected properties. 

&#160; 

Climate Change 

The EPA has published its findings that emissions of CO 2 , methane and certain other greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on its findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emission. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards that typically are established by the states. This rule could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and restrict or delay its ability to obtain air permits for new or modified facilities that exceed GHG emission thresholds. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from oil and natural gas production and processing facilities in the United States on an annual basis. The Company is monitoring and reporting on GHG emissions from certain of its operations upon affected properties. 

However, the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHG gases from, the Company&#8217;s equipment and operations could require it to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas it produces. Finally, to the extent increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events, such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company and potentially subject the Company to further regulation. 

While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level. As a result, a number of 

state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Any future federal laws or implemented regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions could require the Company to incur increased operating costs, adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that the Company produces and have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules, expected to be finalized in 2016, that would establish new controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions by up to 45 percent in 2025. On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that agreed in December 2015 to an international climate change agreement in Paris, France that calls for countries to set their own GHG emissions targets and be transparent about the measure each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. It is not possible at this time to predict how or when the United States might impose restrictions on GHGs as a result of the international agreement agreed to in Paris. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for the Company&#8217;s oil, natural gas and NGL production, and thus possibly have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s revenues. 

Endangered or Threatened Species 

The Endangered Species Act (the &#8220;ESA&#8221;) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. While the Company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with the ESA, exploration and production operations in areas where threatened or endangered species or their habitat are known to exist may require the Company to incur increased costs to implement mitigation or protective measures and also may delay, restrict or preclude drilling activities in those areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. If endangered species are located in areas where the Company wishes to conduct seismic surveys, development activities or abandonment operations, the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the &#8220;FWS&#8221;) is required to consider listing numerous species as endangered under the ESA by the end of the agency&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year. 

For example, in March 2014, the FWS announced the listing of the lesser prairie chicken, whose habitat is over a five-state region, including Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, where the Company operates, as a threatened species under the ESA. However, on September 1, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas vacated the FWS&#8217; rule listing the lesser prairie chicken in its entirety, concluding that the decision to list the species was arbitrary and capricious. As a result of the 2014 listing of the lesser prairie chicken, the Company had entered into a range-wide conservation planning agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to take measures to protect the lesser prairie chicken&#8217;s habitat and to pay a mitigation fee if the Company&#8217;s actions harmed the lesser prairie chicken&#8217;s habitat. Notwithstanding the 2015 decision by the Western District of Texas Court, the Company has continued its participation in the conservation planning agreement. Whether the lesser prairie chicken or other species will be listed in the future under the ESA is currently unknown but the designation of the lesser prairie chicken or any other previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where the Company operates could cause the Company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on its exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on its ability to develop and produce reserves. 

The Company is an active participant on various agency and industry committees that are developing or addressing various EPA and other federal and state agency programs to minimize potential impacts to business activity relating to the protection of any endangered or threatened species. 

Employee Health and Safety 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazardous Communication Standard requires that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in the Company&#8217;s operations and that this information be provided to employees. Pursuant to the Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, also known as Title III of the Federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, facilities that store threshold amounts of chemicals that are subject to OSHA&#8217;s Hazardous Communication Standard above certain threshold quantities must submit information regarding those chemicals by March 1 of each year to state and local authorities in order to facilitate emergency planning and response. That 

information is generally available to the public. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety. 

State Regulation 

The states in which the Company operates, along with some municipalities and Native American tribal areas, regulate some or all of the following activities: the drilling for, and the production and gathering of, oil and natural gas, including requirements relating to drilling permits, the location, spacing and density of wells, unitization and pooling of interests, the method of drilling, casing and equipping of wells, the protection of fresh water sources, the orderly development of common sources of supply of oil and natural gas, the operation of wells, allowable rates of production, the use of fresh water in oil and natural gas operations, saltwater injection and disposal operations, the plugging and abandonment of wells and the restoration of surface properties, the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources, the protection of the correlative rights of oil and natural gas owners and, where necessary to avoid unfair, unjust or discriminatory service, the fees, terms and conditions for the gathering of natural gas. These regulations may affect the number and location of the Company&#8217;s wells and the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from the Company&#8217;s wells, and increase the costs of the Company&#8217;s operations. 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

Oil and natural gas may be recovered from certain of the Company&#8217;s oil and natural gas properties through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated drilling. Hydraulic fracturing, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted federal regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, the EPA issued the Clean Air Act final regulations in 2012 and proposed additional Clean Air Act regulations in August 2015 governing performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry; proposed in April 2015 effluent limitations guidelines that waste water from shale natural gas extraction operations must meet before discharging to a treatment plant; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM) published a final rule in March 2015 that establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands but, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of this rule, which order the BLM could appeal and is being separately appealed by certain environmental groups. 

The BLM also proposed new rules in January 2016 which seek to limit methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas operations on federal lands. The proposal would limit venting and flaring of gas, impose leak detection and repair requirements on wellsite equipment and compressors, and also require the installation of new controls on pneumatic pumps, and other activities at the wellsite such as downhole well maintenance and liquids unloading and drilling workovers and completions to reduce leaks of methane. 

Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. At the state level, some states, including Oklahoma, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Local government may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted at either the state or federal level, the Company&#8217;s fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements, reporting requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These delays or additional costs could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the Company is ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities. 

In addition to asserting regulatory authority, certain government reviews are underway that focus on environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. Also, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources in June 2015, which report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, 

indicating its concern that EPA&#8217;s conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources arising from fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. The final version of this EPA report remains pending and is expected to be completed in 2016. Such EPA final report, when issued, as well as any future studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. 

The Company diligently reviews best practices and industry standards, serves on industry association committees and complies with all regulatory requirements in the protection of potable water sources. Protective practices include, but are not limited to, setting multiple strings of protection pipe across the potable water sources and cementing these pipes from setting depth to surface, continuously monitoring the hydraulic fracturing process in real time and disposing of all non-commercially produced fluids in certified disposal wells at depths below the potable water sources. There have not been any incidents, citations or suits related to the Company&#8217;s hydraulic fracturing activities involving environmental concerns. 

OTHER REGULATION OF THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY 

The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state, local, and regional authorities, as well as Native American tribes. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, and Native American tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the Company&#8217;s cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability, these burdens generally do not affect the Company any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production. 

The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. The FERC&#8217;s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas. 

In July 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) released the details of a comprehensive rulemaking proposal to improve the safe transportation of large quantities of flammable materials by rail, particularly crude oil and ethanol. The Federal Railroad Administration and PHMSA jointly published the final rule on May 1, 2015, and it became effective July 7, 2015. The final rule (i) contains a new enhanced tank car standard and a risk-based retrofitting schedule for older tank cars carrying crude oil and ethanol; (ii) requires a new braking standard for certain trains; (iii) designates new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids, such as routing requirements, speed restrictions, and information for local government agencies; and (iv) provides new sampling and testing requirements to improve classification of energy products placed into transport. 

&#160; 

Sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Although oil, natural gas and NGL prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. The Company cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil, natural gas and NGLs might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the Company&#8217;s operations. 

Drilling and Production 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state, local and Native American tribal levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties, municipalities and Native American tribal areas where the Company operates also regulate one or more of the following activities: 

&#8226; 

the location of wells; 

&#8226; 

the method of drilling and casing wells; 

&#8226; 

the timing of construction or drilling activities; 

&#8226; 

the rates of production, or &#8220;allowables&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

the use of surface or subsurface waters; 

&#8226; 

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; 

&#8226; 

the plugging and abandoning of wells; and 

&#8226; 

the notice to surface owners and other third parties. 

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce the Company&#8217;s interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas the Company can produce from its wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which the Company can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. 

&#32;The Oil Conservation Division of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department requires the posting of financial assurance for owners and operators on privately owned or state land within New Mexico in order to provide for abandonment restoration and remediation of wells. The Railroad Commission of Texas imposes financial assurance requirements on operators. The United States Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. 

Natural Gas Sales and Transportation 

Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas the Company produces and the manner in which the Company markets its production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales, which include all of the Company&#8217;s sales of its own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties. 

FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which the Company may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that the Company produces, as well as the revenues it receives for sales of its natural gas and release of its natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC&#8217;s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, the Company cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can the Company determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on the Company&#8217;s natural gas related activities. 

Under FERC&#8217;s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, nondiscriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in-state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, in the past FERC has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase the Company&#8217;s cost of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations. 

Subsurface Injections 

Our underground injection operations are subject to the SDWA, as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a 

prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require the Company to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate the Company&#8217;s underground injection wells. Although the Company monitors the injection process of its wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of the Company&#8217;s UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third-parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages and personal injuries. Additionally, some states, including Texas, have considered laws mandating the recycling of flowback and produced water. If such laws are passed, the Company&#8217;s operating costs may increase significantly. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 1,165 full-time employees, including 173 &#32;geologists, geophysicists, petroleum engineers, technicians, land and regulatory professionals. Of the Company&#8217;s 1,165 &#32;employees, 552 &#32;were located at the Company&#8217;s headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma at December 31, 2015 , and the remaining employees worked in the Company&#8217;s various field offices and drilling sites. The Company completed a reduction in force during the first quarter of 2016, and as of March 2, 2016, had 864 full-time employees, including 153 geologists, geophysicists, petroleum engineers, technicians, land and regulatory professionals. Approximately 369 of the total full-time employees at March 2, 2016, were located at the Company&#8217;s headquarters in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 

GLOSSARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS TERMS 

The following is a description of the meanings of certain oil and natural gas industry terms used in this report. 

2-D seismic or 3-D seismic. &#32;Geophysical data that depict the subsurface strata in two dimensions or three dimensions, respectively. 3-D seismic typically provides a more detailed and accurate interpretation of the subsurface strata than 2-D seismic. 

Bbl. &#32;One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in this report in reference to oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. 

Bcf. &#32;Billion cubic feet of natural gas. 

Bench. &#32;A geological horizon; a thin, distinctive stratum useful for stratigraphic correlation. 

Boe. &#32;Barrels of oil equivalent, with six thousand cubic feet of natural gas being equivalent to one barrel of oil. Although an equivalent barrel of condensate or natural gas may be equivalent to a barrel of oil on an energy basis, it is not equivalent on a value basis as there may be a large difference in value between an equivalent barrel and a barrel of oil. For example, based on the commodity prices used to prepare the estimate of the Company&#8217;s reserves at year-end 2015 of $46.79 /Bbl for oil and $2.59 /Mcf for natural gas, the ratio of economic value of oil to gas was approximately 18 to 1, even though the ratio for determining energy equivalency is 6 to 1. 

Boe/d. &#32;Boe per day. 

Btu or British thermal unit. &#32;The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. 

Completion. &#32;The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of oil or natural gas, or in the case of a dry well, the reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned. 

Condensate. &#32;A mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature. 

CO 2 . &#32;Carbon dioxide. 

Developed acreage. &#32;The number of acres that are assignable to productive wells. 

Developed oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. &#32;Reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered (i) through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and (ii) through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 

Development costs. &#32;Costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and natural gas. More specifically, development costs, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities, are costs incurred to (i) gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling, including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites, clearing ground, draining, road building and relocating public roads, gas lines and power lines, to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves, (ii) drill and equip development wells, development-type stratigraphic test wells and service wells, including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing, tubing, pumping equipment, and the wellhead assembly, (iii) acquire, construct and install production facilities such as lease flow lines, separators, treaters, heaters, manifolds, measuring devices and production storage tanks, natural gas cycling and processing plants, and central utility and waste disposal systems, and (iv) provide improved recovery systems. 

Development well. &#32;A well drilled within the proved area of an oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. 

Dry well. &#32;An exploratory, development or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well. 

Environmental Assessment (&#8220;EA&#8221;). &#32;A study to determine whether an action significantly affects the environment, which federal or state agencies may be required by the National Environmental Policy Act or similar state statutes to undertake prior to the commencement of activities that would constitute federal or state actions, such as permitting oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. 

Environmental Impact Statement. &#32;A more detailed study of the environmental effects of an undertaking and its alternatives than an EA, which may be required by the National Environmental Policy Act or similar state statutes, either after the EA has been prepared and determined that the environmental consequences of a proposed federal undertaking, such as permitting oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, may be significant, or without the initial preparation of an EA if a federal or state agency anticipates that a proposed undertaking may significantly impact the environment. 

Exploratory well. &#32;A well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to produce oil or natural gas in another reservoir. 

Field. &#32;An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition. There may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata, or laterally by local geological barriers, or both. Reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field. The geological terms &#8220;structural feature&#8221; and &#8220;stratigraphic condition&#8221; are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins, trends, provinces, plays, areas of interest, etc. 

Gross acres or gross wells. &#32;The total acres or wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned.

NYMEX. &#32;The New York Mercantile Exchange. 

Plugging and abandonment. Refers to the sealing off of fluids in the strata penetrated by a well so that the fluids from one stratum will not escape into another or to the surface. Regulations of all states require plugging of abandoned wells. 

Present value of future net revenues (&#8220;PV-10&#8221;). The present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves, before income taxes, calculated in accordance with SEC guidelines, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation and without giving effect to hedging activities, non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization. PV-10 is calculated using an annual discount rate of 10%. 

Production costs. Costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities, including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities, that become part of the cost of oil and gas produced. 

Productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well. 

Prospect. &#32;A specific geographic area that, based on supporting geological, geophysical or other data and also preliminary economic analysis using reasonably anticipated prices and costs, is deemed to have potential for the discovery of commercial hydrocarbons. 

Proved developed reserves. Reserves that are both proved and developed. 

Proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Has the meaning given to such term in Rule 4-10(a)(22) of Regulation S-X, which defines proved reserves as: 

Those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations, prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time. 

The area of a reservoir considered proved includes (i) the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (ii) adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty. 

Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty. 

Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when (i) successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir, or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and (ii) the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

Proved undeveloped reserves. Reserves that are both proved and undeveloped. 

Pulling units. Pulling units are used in connection with completions and workover operations. 

PV-10. &#32;See &#8220;Present value of future net revenues&#8221; above. 

Rental tools. A variety of rental tools and equipment, ranging from trash trailers to blowout preventers to sand separators, for use in the oilfield. 

Reserves. &#32;Estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 

Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir ( i.e., &#32;absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources ( i.e. , potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). 

Reservoir. &#32;A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 

Roustabout services. The provision of manpower to assist in conducting oilfield operations. 

Standardized measure or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, less future development and production costs and future income tax expenses, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate PV-10. Standardized Measure differs from PV-10 because Standardized Measure includes the effect of future income taxes on future net revenues. 

Trucking. &#32;The provision of trucks to move the Company&#8217;s drilling rigs from one well location to another and to deliver water and equipment to the field. 

Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. 

Undeveloped oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. 

(i) 

Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. 

(ii) 

Undrilled locations are classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time. 

(iii) 

Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 

Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations.
