 ITEMS 1. AND 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

The Company 

We are a domestic independent exploration and production company that produces, develops, acquires and explores for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs with operations in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado and the Utica Shale in southeastern Ohio. Our 2016 drilling and completion operations in the Wattenberg Field are expected to focus on the middle core area of the Niobrara and Codell plays. As of December 31, 2015 , we own an interest in approximately 3,000 &#32;gross producing wells, of which approximately 650 &#32;are horizontal. Production of 15.4 &#32;MMboe for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;represents an increase of 65% &#32;compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 . For the month ended December 31, 2015 , we maintained an average production rate of 52 &#32;MBoe per day. We were able to achieve this strong growth rate while maintaining a liquidity position of $402.2 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and a debt to EBITDAX ratio, as defined in our revolving credit facility agreement, of 1.4 times. As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 273 &#32;MMBoe of proved reserves ( 26% &#32;of which are proved developed). Proved reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;were comprised of approximately 60% &#32;liquids and 40% &#32;natural gas, and represent an increase of 23 &#32;MMBoe relative to December 31, 2014 . Our proved reserve additions were primarily a result of the increased well density of proved undeveloped locations in the middle core area of the Niobrara formation in the Wattenberg Field, which allowed for the optimization of our five-year development plan. While the significant decrease in SEC commodity prices utilized in the 2015 year-end reserve report had a minimal impact on our quantities of proved reserves, this decrease in pricing resulted in a 61% &#32;decline in the pre-tax present value of future net revenues (&#8220;PV-10&#8221;) relative to December 31, 2014 . PV-10 is not a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;). See Part I, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures, &#32;for a definition of PV-10 and a reconciliation of our PV-10 value to our standardized measure. 

Our Strengths 

&#8226; 

Multi-year project inventory in premier crude oil, natural gas and NGLs plays. &#32; We have a significant operational presence in the Wattenberg Field, a key U.S. onshore basin, and have identified a substantial inventory of 791 gross proved undeveloped horizontal drilling locations and approximately 1,400 probable horizontal drilling locations in this play. These location counts are based on wells expected to be drilled with an average lateral length of approximately 4,700 feet. Further, with our leaseholds in Ohio, we have the ability to pursue developmental drilling in the emerging Utica Shale play and are focusing our development in the condensate and wet natural gas window of the play. We believe that this inventory will allow us to continue to grow our reserves and production, and that, with respect to the Wattenberg Field in particular, the majority of our projects will generate attractive rates of return at current commodity price projections and our current projected cost structure. 

&#32;2 

&#8226; 

Strong liquidity position. &#32; As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total liquidity position of $402.2 million , comprised of $0.9 million &#32;of cash and cash equivalents and $401.3 million &#32;available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We had $37.0 million &#32;outstanding on our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015 . Our liquidity position will be reduced by $115 million upon the maturity of our 3.25% convertible senior notes in May 2016. Pursuant to the related indenture, we will settle the principal amount of the notes in cash and issue common stock for the excess conversion value upon maturity. In September 2015, we completed the semi-annual redetermination of the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility, which resulted in the reaffirmation of the borrowing base at $700 million. We elected to maintain the aggregate commitment at $450 million. Considering the additional $250 million borrowing base available under our revolving credit facility, subject to certain terms and conditions of the agreement, our liquidity position as of December 31, 2015 &#32;could have been $652.2 million . 

&#8226; 

Significant control in our core areas. &#32; Our operational control is enhanced by the fact that substantially all of our Wattenberg Field leasehold position is held-by-production. We remain flexible in terms of rig activity and capital deployment due to short-term rig contracts and held-by-production acreage. As a result, we can adjust our drilling plans if commodity prices deteriorate further in order to balance cash flows from operations and cash flows from investing activities, which primarily consist of our capital expenditures. Our leaseholds that are held-by-production further enhance our operational control by providing us flexibility in selecting drilling locations based upon various operational criteria. Additionally, as a result of successfully executing our strategy of acquiring largely concentrated acreage positions with a high working interest, we operate and manage approximately 87% &#32;of the wells in which we have an interest. Our high percentage of operated properties enables us to exercise a significant level of control with respect to drilling, production, operating and administrative costs, in addition to leveraging our base of technical expertise in our core operating areas. 

&#8226; 

2016 derivative program. &#32;We have hedged a portion of our short-term future exposure to commodity price fluctuations by entering into crude oil and natural gas collars, fixed-price swaps and basis protection swaps. While our derivative program limits the upside benefits we may otherwise receive during periods of higher commodity prices, the program helps protect our cash flows, borrowing base and liquidity during periods of depressed commodity prices. As of December 31, 2015 , we had hedge positions covering approximately 4,140 &#32;MBbls of 2016 crude oil production, or approximately 45% &#32;to 50% &#32;of our expected crude oil production for the year. These hedges were at a weighted-average minimum price of $77.26 &#32;per Bbl and a weighted-average maximum price of $86.88 &#32;per Bbl. As of the same date, we had hedged approximately 29.8 &#32;Bcf, or approximately 59% &#32;to 65% , of our expected natural gas production in 2016 , at a weighted-average minimum price of $3.62 &#32;per Mcf and a weighted-average maximum price of $3.72 &#32;per Mcf. As of December 31, 2015 , we had hedged a much lower percentage of our expected production for the next 12 to 24 months than we have hedged historically. 

&#8226; 

Technology focused team. We have a proven track record of continuing improvement in both costs and productivity of our well operations. Recently, our teams have focused on transitioning to multi-well pad drilling, extended laterals, increased frac stage density, enhanced frac design and drilling efficiencies. In 2015, we introduced tighter frac stage density and, in 40% of our spuds, extended reach laterals that are 6,500 to 7,000 feet in length. We also began testing plug-and-perf completions along with diverting agents that have provided an uplift to our new well production. We have completed wells at various densities ranging from 16 wells per section equivalent to 26 wells per section equivalent, providing added information on the reserves that can potentially be recovered. Finally, our drilling team has made great strides in reducing drill times for one mile laterals from an average of approximately 14 days to seven days spud-to-spud over the year. 

&#8226; 

Track record of reserve and production growth. &#32; Our proved reserves have grown from 50 &#32;MMBoe at December 31, 2010 , after adjusting for subsequent divestitures, to approximately 273 &#32;MMBoe at December 31, 2015 , representing a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 40% . During the same time period, our proved crude oil and NGL reserves grew at a CAGR of 42% . Our annual production from continuing operations grew from 3.3 &#32;MMBoe in 2010 &#32;to 15.4 &#32;MMBoe in 2015 , representing a CAGR of 36% . Future development of the Wattenberg Field provides the opportunity to add further proved, probable and possible reserves to our portfolio. Similarly, we believe the Utica Shale provides the opportunity for additional proved, probable and possible reserves in a more favorable crude oil and natural gas pricing environment. As a result of data generated from our downspacing testing in the Wattenberg Field, Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (&#8220;Ryder Scott&#8221;), our independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, has increased the density of our proven undeveloped locations, year-over-year, in the Niobrara formation. In general, at December 31, 2013, Niobrara PUD locations were booked at an equivalent density of six wells per section, at December 31, 2014, Niobrara PUD locations were booked at an equivalent density of eight wells per section and at December 31, 2015, Niobrara PUD locations are booked at the equivalent density of 16 wells per section. 

&#8226; 

Strong environmental health and safety compliance programs. &#32;We have focused on establishing effective environmental health and safety programs that are able to earn trust and respect from regulatory agencies and public officials. We believe this is an important part of our strategy in competing in today&#8217;s intensive regulatory and public debate climate, and in working with the local communities in which we operate. 

&#8226; 

Community participation and outreach. &#32;We are dedicated to being an active and contributing member of the communities in which we operate. We share our success with these communities in various ways, including charitable giving and community event sponsorships. We also encourage our employees to take an active role through our charitable matching contribution fund and by participating in our &#8220;Energizing Our Community&#8221; day, during which our employees volunteer in the communities in which they work and live. 

&#32;3 

Business Strategy 

Our long-term business strategy focuses on generating shareholder value through the development, acquisition and exploration of crude oil and natural gas properties. We are currently focused on the organic growth of our reserves, production and cash flows in our horizontal drilling programs after having completed multiple transactions in recent years to restructure and simplify our property portfolio. We pursue various midstream, marketing and cost reduction initiatives designed to increase our per unit operating margins while maintaining a conservative and disciplined financial strategy focused on providing sufficient liquidity and balance sheet strength to execute our business strategy. 

We focus on horizontal development drilling programs in resource plays that offer repeatable results and the potential for attractive returns on investment in the current commodity price environment. Our current inventory of drilling locations supports our planned organic growth over the next several years. We expect it to drive increases in reserves, production and cash flows. In addition to development drilling, we routinely review acquisition and acreage swap opportunities in our core areas of operation as we believe we can extract additional value from such assets through production optimization and increasing our working interest in our development drilling locations. As a result, these types of core acquisitions and acreage swaps can potentially provide synergies that result in economies of scale. We also pursue a limited, but disciplined, exploration program with the goal of replenishing our portfolio with new exploration projects capable of positioning us for significant production and reserve growth in future years. 

Development drilling 

&#160; 

The following map presents the general locations of our development and production activities as of December 31, 2015 : 

&#160; 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Our leasehold interests consist of developed and undeveloped crude oil, natural gas and NGLs resources. Based upon well cost savings resulting from the continued deterioration of commodity prices, our current 2016 &#32;capital forecast is a range between $420 million and $450 million. We have allocated over 90% of our 2016 &#32;capital forecast to our higher-return projects in the Wattenberg Field, primarily in the middle core area. We may decrease our 2016 capital forecast during the year as a result of, among other things, a further decline in commodity prices, a reduction of our current internal outlook for commodity prices, drilling results, unfavorable changes in our borrowing capacity and/or a significant decline in cash flows. 

&#160; 

Wattenberg Field . Our primary focus in the Wattenberg Field is drilling in the horizontal Niobrara and Codell plays. Based on our current drilling program, we have an inventory of 791 gross proved undeveloped horizontal drilling locations and approximately 1,400 gross probable horizontal drilling locations. These locations are in the core Wattenberg Field, which is further delineated between the inner, middle and outer core. In 2016 , we expect to continue to realize additional capital efficiencies through drilling extended length laterals, use of a diverting agent with plug-and-perf completions, well-orientation and mono-bore drilling. We plan to drill standard reach lateral (&#8220;SRL&#8221;), mid-length lateral (&#8220;MRL&#8221;) and extended reach lateral (&#8220;XRL&#8221;) wells in 2016, the majority of which will be in the middle core area of the field. In 2016, we plan to spud 135 and turn-in-line approximately 160 horizontal Niobrara or Codell wells as outlined below.

The 2016 &#32;capital forecast anticipates a four-rig drilling program in the Wattenberg Field based on our current commodity price outlook. Approximately $400 &#32;million of our 2016 &#32;capital forecast is expected to be spent on development activities in the Wattenberg Field, comprised of approximately $350 &#32;million for our operated drilling program and approximately $35 &#32;million for non-operated projects. The remainder of the Wattenberg Field capital forecast is expected to be used for leasing, workover projects and other capital improvements, including the remodeling of our new field office in Greeley, Colorado. We expect to participate in approximately 35 gross, 7.0 net, non-operated horizontal opportunities in 2016 . 

&#160; 

Utica Shale . Our operations in the Utica Shale are currently less significant, and include horizontal drilling locations in the condensate and wet natural gas window of the play. In early 2015, based upon low commodity prices and large natural gas price differentials in Appalachia, we elected to temporarily cease drilling in the Utica Shale and limited our activity to completing and turning-in-line a four-well pad that was in process as of December 31, 2014. Due to a further significant decline in commodity prices and a decrease in net-back realizations, in the third quarter of 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of $150.3 million &#32;to write-down our Utica Shale producing and non-producing crude oil and natural gas properties. Based on the production results from our most recently drilled wells and the significant decrease in well costs, in 2016 we plan on executing a modest drilling operation in the condensate and wet natural gas window of the play. Early in 2016, we plan to spend approximately $35 million &#32;in the Utica Shale to drill, complete and turn-in-line five wells, all of which will have laterals of at least 6,000 feet. The planned activity will focus on further delineation of our southern acreage, determining the impact of well-orientation on productivity and testing improved capital efficiency of a 10,000 foot lateral length well. 

While we expect to outspend our cash flows from operations during the first half of 2016, we believe that our cash flows from operations will exceed our cash flows from investing activities, which primarily consist of our capital expenditures, in the second half of 2016. As a result, we expect our overall 2016 cash flows from operations to approximate our cash flows from investing activities. However, a further deterioration of commodity prices could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and future development plans. We may decrease our 2016 capital forecast during the year as a result of, among other things, a further decline in commodity prices, drilling results, unfavorable changes in our borrowing capacity and/or a significant decline in cash flows. If commodity pricing falls short of our internal expectations, we would likely look to reduce our capital investment in the second quarter of 2016 to maintain our goal of capital expenditures approximating operational cash flows. We may change our capital expenditure plans from time to time for other reasons as well, including as a result of regulatory issues, drilling results or acquisition or divestiture opportunities. Our liquidity position will be reduced by the cash payment of approximately $115 million upon the maturity of our 3.25% convertible senior notes in May 2016. See Part I, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - 2016 Operational Flexibility, for additional information. 

Operational and financial risk management 

We proactively employ strategies to help reduce the financial risks associated with our industry. One such strategy is to utilize commodity-based derivative instruments to manage a portion of our short-term exposure to price volatility with regard to our crude oil and natural gas sales and natural gas marketing segments. As of December 31, 2015 , we had natural gas and crude oil derivative positions in place for 2016 &#32;covering approximately &#32; 4,140 &#32;MBbls of our crude oil production and approximately 29.8 &#32;Bcf of our natural gas production and for 2017 covering approximately &#32; 1,440 &#32;MBbls of our crude oil production and approximately 32.5 &#32;Bcf of our natural gas production. Currently, we do not hedge our NGL production. 

Strategic acquisitions 

We examine and evaluate acquisition opportunities as they present themselves and pursue those that meet our strategic plan and that we believe would increase shareholder value. We typically pursue the acquisition of assets with high quality undeveloped drilling locations, producing wells and/or behind-pipe reserves. We seek properties with large undeveloped drilling upside where we believe we can utilize our operational abilities to add shareholder value. In addition, we may pursue opportunities to swap acreage with other producers in order to optimize our portfolio by consolidating and concentrating our core assets. The large contiguous acreage blocks created through swapping of acreage provide the opportunity to optimize drilling activities and add more extended-reach lateral wells to our drilling program. We have an experienced team of management, engineering, geosciences and commercial professionals who identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities. 

Selective exploration 

&#160; 

In the current commodity pricing environment, we do not expect our exploration activity to be significant in 2016. Historically, we have pursued a disciplined exploration program intended to replenish our portfolio and to position us for production and reserve growth in future 

&#32;5 

years. We have attempted to identify potential plays in their early stages in order to accumulate significant leasehold positions prior to competitive forces driving up the cost of entry and to invest in leasehold positions that are in the proximity of existing or emerging midstream infrastructure. 

Business Segments 

We divide our operating activities into two segments: (1) Oil and Gas Exploration and Production and (2) Gas Marketing. 

Oil and Gas Exploration and Production 

Our Oil and Gas Exploration and Production segment primarily reflects revenues and expenses from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, commodity price risk management and well operations. The exploration for and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs involves the acquisition or leasing of mineral rights to proved reserves and related surface rights. Prior to development of these properties, we assess the economic viability of potential well development opportunities. We then develop the reserves through the drilling of oil and gas wells, which are drilled, completed and put into production. Subsequent to completion, we operate and maintain the wells while controlling associated production costs. Upon extraction of the estimated recoverable reserves from a well, it is plugged and surface disturbance surrounding the well and producing facilities is remediated. In some cases, we may also own a working interest in wells operated by unrelated third-parties. The Oil and Gas Exploration and Production segment's most significant customers are currently Suncor Energy Marketing, Inc., Concord Energy, LLC, DCP Midstream, LP and Shell Trading Company. Sales to each of these parties constitute more than 10% of our revenues. 

Our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production is gathered, marketed and sold as follows: 

&#8226; 

Crude oil . We do not refine any of our crude oil production. In the Wattenberg Field, crude oil is sold under various purchase contracts with monthly and longer term pricing provisions based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials. We have entered into longer term commitments ranging from three months to one year to deliver crude oil to competitive markets and these agreements have resulted in significantly improved deductions compared to earlier in 2015. We continue to pursue various alternatives with respect to oil transportation, particularly in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward further improving pricing and limiting our use of trucking of production. We began delivering crude oil in accordance with our long term commitment to the White Cliffs Pipeline, LLC ("White Cliffs") pipeline in July 2015. This is one of several agreements we have entered into to facilitate deliveries of a portion of our crude oil to the Cushing, Oklahoma market. In addition, we have signed a long-term agreement for gathering of crude oil at the wellhead by pipeline from several of our pads in the Wattenberg Field, with a view toward minimizing truck traffic, increasing reliability and reducing the overall physical footprint of our well pads. We began delivering crude oil into this pipeline during the fourth quarter of 2015 and expect the system to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2016. In the Utica Shale, crude oil and condensate is sold to local purchasers at each individual well site based on NYMEX pricing, adjusted for differentials, and is typically transported by the purchasers via truck to local refineries, rail facilities or barge loading terminals on the Ohio River. 

&#8226; 

Natural gas . We primarily sell our natural gas to midstream service providers, marketers and utilities. Our natural gas is transported through third-party gathering systems and pipelines and we incur gathering, processing and transportation expenses to move our natural gas from the wellhead to a purchaser-specified delivery point. We generally sell the natural gas that we produce in the Wattenberg Field under contracts with indexed, NYMEX or CIG monthly pricing provisions, with the remaining production sold under contracts with daily pricing provisions. Virtually all of our contracts include provisions whereby prices change with the market, with certain adjustments that may be made based on whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line and the quality of the natural gas. We have entered into firm gathering and processing agreements for all of our gas production to ensure there is infrastructure available to process the gas and get it to market. In the Wattenberg Field, the majority of our leasehold is dedicated to our primary midstream provider, DCP Midstream, LP, which gathers and processes wet natural gas produced in the basin and sells our residue gas to various markets. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with AKA Energy Group ("AKA") whereby we have committed production from a specified number of new horizontal wells to be drilled and completed by the end of 2016. Pursuant to the agreement, AKA is required to install and operate, or contract for use of, facilities necessary to receive and purchase the production volumes committed under the agreement. In the Utica Shale, wet natural gas produced in our northern acreage is gathered and processed pursuant to a firm gathering and processing agreement with MarkWest Utica EMG ("MarkWest") while wet natural gas produced in our southern acreage is gathered and processed by Blue Racer Midstream LLC ("Blue Racer"). The natural gas sales from the Blue Racer Plant are based on TETCO M-2 pricing. The gas sold at the tailgate of the MarkWest plant is sold at a price relative to the Chicago/Midwest market. Our sale of a significant portion of our Utica Shale gas to the Midwest market has helped to reduce the impact of the significant differentials that exist between the TETCO M-2 realizations and the NYMEX gas price. We anticipate that the significant Appalachian pipeline differentials that impact our Utica Shale natural gas, which make economics challenging, will continue well into 2016. 

&#8226; 

NGLs . In the Wattenberg Field, all of our NGLs are sold at the tailgate of the third-party midstream service provider processing plants based on a combination of prices from the Conway hub in Kansas and Mt. Belvieu in Texas where this production is marketed. In the Utica Shale, our NGLs are fractionated and marketed by MarkWest and Blue Racer and sold based on month-to-month pricing in various markets. Our NGL production is sold under both short- and long-term contracts. Due to an oversupply and growing inventories of nearly all domestic NGLs products, our realized sales price for NGLs declined significantly during 2015 and, while these prices have stabilized, we expect pricing to remain at depressed levels well into 2016 and perhaps beyond. 

&#160; 

&#32;6 

Gas Marketing 

Our Gas Marketing segment is comprised solely of the operating activities of our wholly-owned subsidiary RNG. RNG specializes in the purchase, aggregation and sale of natural gas production in the Appalachian Basin. Financial results from our gas marketing segment were not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the periods presented in this report and we do not expect them to be material in the future. RNG purchases for resale natural gas produced by third-party producers. The natural gas is marketed to third-party marketers, natural gas utilities and industrial and commercial customers through transportation services provided by regulated interstate/intrastate pipeline companies. RNG is party to long-term firm transportation, sales and processing agreements for pipeline capacity through August 2022. As of December 31, 2015, the dollar commitment related to this long-term firm transportation, sales and processing agreement was approximately $20.6 million. This long-term pipeline capacity commitment was made on behalf of our third-party producers, and also includes an unutilized portion; however, we remain obligated to fulfill this commitment regardless of whether or not our third-party producers meet their commitments. As natural gas prices continue to remain depressed, certain third-party producers under our Gas Marketing segment have begun and may continue to experience financial distress, which has led to certain contractual defaults and litigation. To date, we have had no material counterparty default losses; however, we expect continued deterioration in the financial position of some counterparties. In 2015, we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $0.5 million . We have initiated several legal actions for collection against some of the third-party producers, which have resulted in no collections and some of the third-party producers shutting-in wells. As a result, we expect RNG's expenses to exceed its revenues by approximately $1 million to $2 million per year through 2022, assuming a continuation of current economic conditions. Following the sale of our 50% ownership interest in PDCM in October 2014, RNG's marketing activities were scaled down and are focused on selling natural gas production to meet its volume commitments. After the long-term firm transportation agreements expire, we expect to discontinue this segment. 

For additional information regarding our business segments, see Note 17, Business Segments , to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Our proved reserves are sensitive to future crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales prices and the related effect on the economic productive life of producing properties. Increases in commodity prices may result in a longer economic productive life of a property or result in recognition of more economically viable proved undeveloped reserves. Decreases in commodity prices may result in negative impacts of this nature. 

All of our proved reserves are located onshore in the U.S. Our proved reserve estimates are prepared using the definitions for proved reserves set forth in SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10(a) and other applicable SEC rules. As of December 31, 2015 , all of our proved reserves, including our proportionate share of our affiliated partnerships' reserves, have been estimated by Ryder Scott. 

&#32;7 

We have a comprehensive process that governs the determination and reporting of our proved reserves. As part of our internal control process, our reserves are reviewed annually by an internal team composed of reservoir engineers, geologists and accounting personnel for adherence to SEC guidelines through a detailed review of land records, available geological and reservoir data, and production performance data. The process includes a review of applicable working and net revenue interests and cost and performance data. The internal team compiles the reviewed data and forwards the data to Ryder Scott. 

When preparing our reserve estimates, Ryder Scott did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, production volumes, well test data, historical costs of operations and development, product prices or any agreements relating to current and future operations of properties and sales of production. Ryder Scott prepares an estimate of our reserves in conjunction with an ongoing review by our engineers. A final comparison of data is performed to ensure that the reserve estimates are complete, determined pursuant to acceptable industry methods and with a level of detail we deem appropriate. The final estimated reserve report is reviewed by our engineering staff and management prior to issuance by Ryder Scott. 

&#160; 

The professional qualifications of the internal lead engineer primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates qualify the engineer as a Reserves Estimator, as defined in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information as promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. This person holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum and Chemical Refining Engineering with a minor in Petroleum Engineering, has over 39 years of experience in reservoir engineering, is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Colorado. 

The SEC's reserve rules allow the use of techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. We used a combination of performance methods including decline curve analysis and other computational methods, offset analogies, and seismic data and interpretation to calculate our 2015 &#32;reserve estimates. All of our proved undeveloped reserves conform to the SEC five-year rule requirement as all proved undeveloped locations are scheduled, according to an adopted development plan, to be drilled within five years of each location&#8217;s initial booking date. 

Reserve estimates involve judgments and cannot be measured exactly. The estimates must be reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information gained from reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data and economic changes. Neither the estimated future net cash flows nor the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows ("standardized measure") is intended to represent the current market value of our proved reserves. For additional information regarding both of these measures, as well as other information regarding our proved reserves, see the unaudited Supplemental Information - Crude Oil and Natural Gas Information &#32;provided with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

We have stress-tested our proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2015 &#32;to determine the impact of lower crude oil prices. Replacing the 2015 NYMEX commodity prices used in estimating our reported proved reserves (see Supplemental Information - Crude Oil and Natural Gas Information, &#32;provided with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report) with those shown on the table below, and leaving all other parameters unchanged, results in a decrease in our estimated proved reserves as shown below.

Substantially all of our undeveloped acreage in the Wattenberg Field is related to leaseholds that are held-by-production. Approximately 8% , 21% &#32;and 7% &#32;of our undeveloped leaseholds in the Utica Shale are scheduled to expire during 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. While the undeveloped leaseholds expiring in 2016 in the Utica Shale are not significant, we believe that our planned modest investment in the Utica Shale in 2016 will provide production, reservoir and completion analyses that will provide us with a better understanding of our Utica Shale acreage as we exit 2016 and may influence our re-leasing decisions as more undeveloped leaseholds expire in 2017. In the event these leaseholds are not renewed, we do not expect a significant charge as the carrying value of our Utica Shale acreage as of December 31, 2015 &#32;is not material as a result of impairments recorded in 2014 and 2015.

Title to Properties 

We believe that we hold good and defensible leasehold title to substantially all of our crude oil and natural gas properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry. A preliminary title examination is typically conducted at the time the undeveloped properties are acquired. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations, a title examination is conducted and remedial curative work is performed with respect to discovered defects which we deem to be significant. Title examinations have been performed with respect to substantially all of our producing properties. 

The properties we own are subject to royalty, overriding royalty and other outstanding interests. The properties may also be subject to additional burdens, liens or encumbrances customary in the industry, including items such as operating agreements, current taxes, development obligations under crude oil and natural gas leases, farm-out agreements and other restrictions. We do not believe that any of these burdens will materially interfere with our use of the properties. 

Substantially all of our crude oil and natural gas properties, excluding our share of properties held by the limited partnerships that we sponsor, have been mortgaged or pledged as security for our revolving credit facility. See Note 8, Long-Term Debt , to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Facilities 

We lease 56,000 square feet of office space in Denver, Colorado, which serves as our corporate office, through February 2021. We own a 32,000 square foot administrative office building located in Bridgeport, West Virginia and a newly acquired 60,000 square foot field operating facility in Greeley, Colorado. 

We own or lease field operating facilities in Evans, Colorado and Marietta, Ohio. 

Governmental Regulation 

While the prices of crude oil and natural gas are market driven, other aspects of our business and the industry in general are heavily regulated. The availability of a ready market for crude oil and natural gas production depends on several factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, regulation of production, federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control, the amount of crude oil and natural gas available for sale, the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels. In general, state and federal regulations are intended to protect consumers from unfair treatment and undue control, reduce environmental and health risks from the development and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, prevent misuse of crude oil and natural gas and protect rights among owners in a common reservoir. Pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal, state and local agencies. We believe that we are in compliance with such statutes, rules, regulations and governmental orders in all material respects, although there can be no assurance that this is or will remain the case. The following summary discussion of the regulation of the U.S. oil and gas industry is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes, rules, regulations and environmental directives to which our operations may be subject. 

Regulation of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Exploration and Production . Our exploration and production business is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the taxation of crude oil and natural gas, the development, production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas and environmental and safety matters. State and local laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing and density of wells, rates of production, water discharge, prevention of waste and other matters. Prior to commencing drilling activities for a well, we must procure permits and/or approvals for the various stages of the drilling process from the applicable state and local agencies where the well being drilled is located. Additionally, other regulated matters include: 

&#8226; 

bond requirements in order to drill or operate wells; 

&#8226; 

well locations; 

&#8226; 

drilling and casing methods; 

&#32;11 

&#8226; 

surface use and restoration of well properties; 

&#8226; 

well plugging and abandoning; 

&#8226; 

fluid disposal; and 

&#8226; 

air emissions. 

In 2014, Colorado Governor Hickenlooper created a task force charged with crafting recommendations to help minimize land use conflicts relating to the location of oil and gas facilities. The task force was created pursuant to a compromise under which certain potential ballot initiatives that would have impacted the oil and natural gas industry in Colorado were withdrawn from the November 2014 ballot. The task force, which was called the Task Force on State and Local Regulation of Oil and Gas Operations, was comprised of 21 members representing various interests. Recommendations of the task force regarding new or amended legislation, appropriations or other action were submitted to the Governor in February 2015. In 2015 and into 2016, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (the &#8220;COGCC&#8221;) conducted a rulemaking to implement two of these task force recommendations related to the permitting of large-scale facilities in urban mitigation areas and municipality notice provisions. Both rulemakings were finalized in January 2016 and new rules will become effective in spring 2016. In addition, depending on the outcome of the task force process and any related legislative or administrative activity, ballot initiatives, like those proposed in December 2015 and again in January 2016, affecting our operations may be proposed and adopted by the voters in future elections. 

In addition, our drilling activities involve hydraulic fracturing, which may be subject to additional federal and state disclosure and regulatory requirements discussed in "Environmental Matters" below and in Item 1A, Risk Factors . 

Our operations also are subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the density of wells which may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of lands and leases. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be more difficult to form units, and therefore, more difficult to drill and develop our leases where we own less than 100% of the leases located within the proposed unit. State laws may establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells, prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production. Leases covering state or federal lands often include additional regulations and conditions. The effect of these conservation laws and regulations may limit the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Such laws and regulations may increase the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning our crude oil and natural gas wells and other facilities. These laws and regulations, and any others that are passed by the jurisdictions where we have production, can limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable production from successful wells, which can limit our reserves. As a result, we are unable to predict the future cost or effect of complying with such regulations. 

Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas . We move natural gas through pipelines owned by other companies and sell natural gas to other companies that also utilize common carrier pipeline facilities. Natural gas pipeline interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 ("NGA") and under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, accounting, and the extension, enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities, among other things, are subject to regulation. Each natural gas pipeline company holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines, facilities and properties for which certificates are required under the NGA. Each natural gas pipeline company is also subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, which imposes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities. FERC regulations govern how interstate pipelines communicate and do business with their affiliates. Interstate pipelines may not operate their pipeline systems to preferentially benefit their marketing affiliates. 

Each interstate natural gas pipeline company establishes its rates primarily through FERC's rate-making process. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are: 

&#8226; 

costs of providing service, including depreciation expense; 

&#8226; 

allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes; and 

&#8226; 

volume throughput assumptions. 

The availability, terms and cost of transportation affect our natural gas sales. Competition among suppliers has greatly increased. Furthermore, gathering is exempt from regulation under the Natural Gas Act, thus allowing gatherers to charge unregulated rates. Historically, producers were able to flow supplies into interstate pipelines on an interruptible basis; however, recently we have seen the increased need to acquire firm transportation on pipelines in order to avoid curtailments or shut-in gas, which could adversely affect cash flows from the affected area. 

Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the industry occur frequently in Congress, FERC, state commissions, state legislatures and the courts. The industry historically has been very heavily regulated and there is no assurance that the current regulatory approach recently taken by FERC and Congress will continue. We cannot determine to what extent our future operations and earnings will be affected by new legislation, new regulations, or changes in existing regulation, at federal, state or local levels. 

&#32;12 

Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Public demand for the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend towards more expansive environmental legislation and regulations is expected to continue. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken which restrict drilling or impose environmental protection requirements resulting in increased costs, our business and prospects may be adversely affected. 

We generate wastes that may be subject to the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and various state agencies have adopted requirements that limit the approved disposal methods for certain hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Furthermore, certain wastes generated by our operations that are currently exempt from treatment as "hazardous wastes" may in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes," and therefore may subject us to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements. 

Hydraulic fracturing is commonly used to stimulate production of crude oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely apply fracturing in our crude oil and natural gas production programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation. The water and pressure create fractures in the rock formations, which are held open by the grains of sand, enabling the crude oil or natural gas to more easily flow to the wellbore. The process is generally subject to regulation by state oil and gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain fracturing activities involving diesel fuel under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") and issued draft guidance related to this asserted regulatory authority in February 2014. The guidance explains the EPA&#8217;s interpretation of the term &#8220;diesel fuel&#8221; for permitting purposes, describes existing Underground Injection Control Class II program requirements for permitting underground injection of diesel fuels in hydraulic fracturing and also provides recommendations for EPA permit writers in implementing these requirements. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would provide for broader federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. 

The White House Council on Environmental Quality continues to coordinate an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing. The EPA continues its study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater and issued a draft assessment in June 2015, with a final, peer-reviewed report expected in 2016. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy has investigated practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic fracturing completion methods. These ongoing studies, depending on their degree of development and nature of results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. The U.S. Department of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management (the &#8220;BLM&#8221;), also finalized a rule in 2015 requiring the disclosure of chemicals used, mandating well integrity measures, and imposing other requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. The rule is currently stayed and not effective pending ongoing litigation. 

The states in which we operate, Colorado and Ohio, have adopted regulations regarding permitting, transparency and well construction requirements with respect to hydraulic fracturing operations and may in the future adopt additional regulations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Colorado requires that all chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing of a well be reported in a publicly searchable registry website developed and maintained by the Ground Water Protection Council and Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission ("Frac Focus"). The Colorado rules also require operators seeking new location approvals to provide certain information to surface owners and adjacent property owners within 500 feet of a new well. Similarly, Colorado has implemented a baseline groundwater sampling rule, a rule governing setback distances of oil and gas wells located near population centers, and recently adopted new rules governing the development of large-scale facilities in urban mitigation areas and additional municipality notice requirements. In December 2013, the COGCC issued new, more restrictive rules regarding spill reporting and remediation. See further discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors . 

In addition, during 2014, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Act was amended to increase the potential sanctions for violating the Act or its implementing regulations, orders, or permits. These amendments increase the maximum penalty per violation per day from $1,000 to $15,000; eliminate a $10,000 maximum penalty for violations that do not result in significant waste of oil and gas resources, damage to correlative rights, or adverse impact to public health, safety, or welfare; require the COGCC to assess a penalty for each day there is evidence of a violation; and authorize the COGCC to prohibit the issuance of new permits and suspend certificates of clearance for egregious violations resulting from gross negligence or knowing and willful misconduct. In December 2014, the COGCC convened a hearing and adopted proposed amendments to its regulations to implement this new legislation and address certain other issues. Among other things, the amendments create a new process for calculating penalties, new standards for determining days of violation and penalty amounts, new restrictions on the use of informal enforcement procedures and penalty reductions for voluntary disclosures. Following the adoption of this new penalty scheme, Colorado operators have experienced increased penalties for violations within COGCC&#8217;s jurisdiction. 

In 2015, the COGCC convened hearings on regulations for large facilities located in urban mitigation areas. These new rules, which are anticipated to be effective in March 2016, require best available technology and include required mitigations for emissions, flaring, fire, fluid leak detection, repair, reporting, automated well shut-in, storage tank pressure control and proppant dust control. During these hearings, COGCC staff reported there would also be site-specific mitigation requirements for noise, ground and surface water protection, visual impacts and remote stimulation. After debate, the rule did not include duration limits despite an opinion from the State Attorney General Office that the COGCC possessed authority to impose duration limits under current and existing statutes. 

In November 2013, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources ("ODNR") proposed draft regulations pertaining to well pad construction requirements and increased bonding for construction, and these regulations were finalized in 2014. 

&#32;13 

In October 2015, the ODNR proposed draft regulations pertaining to incident notification. These rules are not yet final and we do not have an anticipated effective date. Additionally, in November 2015, the ODNR Assistant Chief announced draft rules in progress include waste management, waste classification, secondary containment, emergency reporting, site remediation standards, well spacing and simultaneous operations. We continue to be an active participant in the rule making process in Ohio. 

In Colorado, local governing bodies have begun to issue drilling moratoriums, develop jurisdictional siting, permitting and operating requirements and conduct air quality studies to identify potential public health impacts. For instance, in 2013, the City of Fort Collins, Colorado, adopted a ban on drilling and fracturing of new wells within city limits. In the November 2013 election, voters in the cities of Boulder, Lafayette, Fort Collins and Brighton passed hydraulic fracturing bans. See Item 1A, Risk Factors , for a more detailed discussion of these bans. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or well locations continue to be adopted at local levels or are adopted at the state level, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from dense subsurface rock formations and, in the event of local prohibitions against commercial production of hydrocarbons, may preclude our ability to drill wells. If hydraulic fracturing becomes more heavily regulated as a result of federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other federal agencies, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and permitting delays, as well as potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. We continue to be active in stakeholder and interest groups and to engage with regulatory agencies in an open, proactive dialogue regarding these matters. 

We currently own or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. Although we believe that we have generally utilized good operating and waste disposal practices, and when necessary, appropriate remediation techniques, prior owners and operators of these properties may not have utilized similar practices and techniques and hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties that we own or lease or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), RCRA and analogous state laws, as well as state laws governing the management of crude oil and natural gas wastes. Under such laws, we may be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or remediate property contamination (including surface and groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination. 

CERCLA and similar state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for release of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to full liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Under state laws, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. As an owner and operator of crude oil and natural gas wells, we may be liable pursuant to CERCLA and similar state laws. 

Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act ("CAA") and comparable state and local requirements. The CAA contains provisions that may result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations. The EPA and states continue the development of regulations to implement these requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission-related issues. Greenhouse gas record keeping and reporting requirements of the CAA became effective in 2011 and will continue into the future with increased costs for administration and implementation of controls. Federal New Source Performance Standards regarding oil and gas operations ("NSPS OOOO") became effective in 2012, with more amendments effective in 2013 and 2014, all of which have added administrative and operational costs. In addition, as part of its comprehensive strategy to further reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, EPA proposed amendments to NSPS OOOO in 2015 that would impose additional control and other requirements to reduce such emissions. A final rule is expected in the summer of 2016. Colorado adopted new regulations to meet the requirements of NSPS OOOO and promulgated significant new rules in February 2014 relating specifically to crude oil and natural gas operations that are more stringent than NSPS OOOO and directly regulate methane emissions from affected facilities. In April 2014, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Division of Air Pollution Control adopted new General Permit requirements for High Volume Horizontal Hydraulic Fracturing, Oil and Gas Well Site Production Operations. In October 2015, the EPA strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ground level ozone to 70 parts per billion (&#8220;ppb&#8221;) from 75 ppb. In addition, the EPA extended the ozone monitoring season for 32 states, including Colorado and Ohio. By October 2016, states are expected to have revised state implementation plans and proposed regulations to meet the new standard. 

The federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and analogous state laws impose strict controls against the discharge of pollutants and fill material, including spills and leaks of crude oil and other substances. The CWA also requires approval and/or permits prior to construction, where construction will disturb wetlands or other waters of the U.S. The CWA also regulates storm water run-off from crude oil and natural gas facilities and requires storm water discharge permits for certain activities. Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure ("SPCC") requirements of the CWA require appropriate secondary containment loadout controls, piping controls, berms and other measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon spill, rupture or leak. The EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a Connectivity Report in September 2013 which determined that the vast majority of tributary streams, wetlands, open water in floodplains and riparian areas are connected. This report supported the final rule issued in June 2015 defining the scope of jurisdictional Waters of the U.S. This final rule has been stayed pending the resolution of ongoing litigation. 

&#32;14 

The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our operations may be located in areas that are or may be designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in May 2014 proposed a rule to alter how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. It is unclear when this rule will be finalized. 

Crude oil production is subject to many of the same operating hazards and environmental concerns as natural gas production, but is also subject to the risk of crude oil spills. Federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle crude oil, including us, to procure and implement additional SPCC measures relating to the possible discharge of crude oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from crude oil spills. Noncompliance with OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced any significant crude oil discharge or crude oil spill problems. Our shift in production since mid-2010 to a greater percentage of crude oil increases our risks related to soil and water contamination from any future oil spills. 

&#160; 

Our costs relating to protecting the environment have risen over the past few years and are expected to continue to rise in 2016 and beyond. Environmental regulations have increased our costs and planning time, but have had no materially adverse effect on our ability to operate to date. However, no assurance can be given that environmental regulations or interpretations of such regulations will not, in the future, result in a curtailment of production or otherwise have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies , to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Operating Hazards and Insurance 

Our exploration and production operations include a variety of operating risks, including, but not limited to, the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, cratering, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as gas leaks, ruptures and discharges of crude oil and natural gas. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. Our pipeline, gathering and distribution operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the industry. These hazards include damage to wells, pipelines and other related equipment, damage to property caused by hurricanes, floods, fires and other acts of God, inadvertent damage from construction equipment, leakage of natural gas and other hydrocarbons, fires and explosions and other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. In 2013, we experienced widespread flooding in our Wattenberg Field operations in Weld County, Colorado, which resulted in a shut-in of approximately 200 vertical wells. We incurred significant costs to replace damaged well equipment and to bring vertical wells back on-line. In 2014 and 2015, we experienced three mechanical failures during drilling that resulted in the discharge of oil and related material. The mechanical failures did not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Among the regulatory developments involving operating hazards that could impact us going forward are recent investigations by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and other governmental authorities regarding potential worker exposure to hydrocarbon vapors from certain petroleum transfer and related tasks. Several recent worker fatalities at oil and gas facilities nationwide are being reviewed by OSHA and other governmental authorities for a potential link to hydrocarbon vapor exposure. Regulatory requirements generally relating to worker exposure to hydrocarbon vapors could be increased or receive heightened scrutiny going forward. 

Any significant problems related to our facilities could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure for liability. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured against could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether insurance will continue to be available at premium levels that justify our purchase or will be available at all. Furthermore, we are not insured against our economic losses resulting from damage or destruction to third-party property, such as transportation pipelines, crude oil refineries or natural gas processing facilities. Such an event could result in significantly lower regional prices or our inability to deliver our production. 

Competition and Technological Changes 

We believe that our production, exploration and drilling capabilities and the experience of our management and professional staff enable us to compete effectively in our industry. We encounter competition from numerous other crude oil and natural gas companies, drilling and income programs and partnerships in all areas of operations, including drilling and marketing crude oil and natural gas, obtaining desirable crude oil and natural gas leases on producing properties, obtaining drilling, pumping and other services, attracting and retaining qualified employees and obtaining capital. International developments may influence other companies to increase their domestic crude oil and natural gas exploration. Competition among companies for favorable prospects can be expected to continue and it is anticipated that the cost of acquiring properties will increase in the future. Many of our competitors possess larger staffs and greater financial resources than we do, which may enable them to identify and acquire desirable producing properties and drilling prospects more economically. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to explore for crude oil and natural gas prospects in the future depends upon our ability to conduct our operations, evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. We also face intense competition in other aspects of our business, including the marketing of natural gas from competitors including other producers and marketing companies. 

The oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introduction of new products and services using new technologies. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future become obsolete or if we are unable to use the 

&#32;15 

most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 362 full-time employees. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
