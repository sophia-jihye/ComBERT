 ITEM 1. &#32;&#32; BUSINESS 

Overview 

MasterCard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments and businesses worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. As the operator of what we believe is the world&#8217;s fastest payments network, we facilitate the processing of payment transactions, 

including authorization, clearing and settlement, and deliver related products and services. We make payments easier and more efficient by creating a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known brands, including MasterCard&#174;, Maestro&#174; and Cirrus&#174;. We also provide value-added offerings such as loyalty and reward programs, information services and consulting. Our network is designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system. 

A typical transaction on our network involves four participants in addition to us: cardholder (an individual who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), merchant, issuer (the cardholder&#8217;s financial institution) and acquirer (the merchant&#8217;s financial institution). We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants&#8217; acceptance of our branded cards. In most cases, cardholder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our financial institution customers. 

We generate revenue by charging fees to issuers and acquirers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services, as well as by assessing these customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity, or gross dollar volume (&#8220;GDV&#8221;), on the cards and other devices that carry our brands. 

Our Strategy 

Our ability to grow our business is influenced by personal consumption expenditure growth, driving cash and check transactions toward electronic forms of payment, increasing our share in electronic payments and providing value-added products and services. We achieve our strategy by growing, diversifying and building our business. 

Grow . &#32;&#32;We focus on growing our core businesses globally, including growing our credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions and increasing the number of payment transactions we process. 

Diversify . &#32;&#32;We look to diversify our business by focusing on: 

&#8226; 

diversifying our customer base in new and existing markets by working with partners such as governments, merchants, large digital companies and other technology companies, mobile providers and other businesses; 

&#8226; 

encouraging use of our products and solutions in areas that provide new opportunities for electronic payments, such as transit and person-to-person transfers; 

&#8226; 

driving acceptance at small business merchants, including those who have not historically accepted electronic payments; and 

&#8226; 

broadening financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked. 

Build . &#32;&#32;We build our business by: 

&#8226; 

taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the evolving ways consumers interact and transact as physical and digital payments converge; and 

&#8226; 

using our safety and security products and solutions, data analytics and loyalty solutions to add value. 

We grow, diversify and build our business through a combination of organic growth and strategic investments, including acquisitions. 

Strategic Partners . &#32;&#32;We work with a variety of stakeholders. We provide financial institutions with solutions to help them increase revenue and increase preference for their MasterCard-branded products. We help merchants by delivering data-driven insights and other services to help them grow and create better and secure purchase experiences for consumers across physical and digital channels. We partner with large digital companies and other technology companies, mobile providers and telecommunication companies to support their digital payment solutions with our technology, expertise and security protocols. We help national and local governments drive increased financial inclusion and efficiency, reduce costs, increase transparency to reduce crime and corruption and advance social programs. For consumers, we provide better, safer and more convenient ways to pay. 

Recent Business and Legal/Regulatory Developments 

Product Innovation . &#32;&#32;We have launched and extended products and platforms that take advantage of the growing digital economy (including the Internet of Things), where consumers are increasingly using technology to interact with merchants. Among our recent developments: 

&#8226; 

In 2015, we expanded the availability of MasterPass&#8482;, our global digital payments ecosystem. It provides an easy and secure way to shop by storing payment information in one convenient and secure place and enabling consumers to access that information to make a payment with a simple click or touch. 

&#8226; 

We are using our digital technologies and security protocols to develop solutions to make shopping and selling experiences on mobile devices (such as smartphones) simpler, faster and safer for both consumers and merchants. In 2015, we continued to enhance the suite of digital token services we offer through our MasterCard Digital Enablement Service (MDES). We also launched the MDES Express program, a commercial framework that provides financial institutions and digital participants (including large digital companies, merchants and other companies) the ability to quickly scale digital payment offerings to consumers, allowing connected devices to be used as a safe and secure way to pay for everyday shopping. 

&#8226; 

In 2015, we launched MasterCard Send&#8482;, a service that facilitates the delivery of funds via financial institutions from business to consumer and from consumers to consumers quickly and securely. 

Safety and Security. &#32;&#32; Our focus on security is embedded in our products, our systems and our network, as well as our analytics to prevent fraud: 

&#8226; 

We continue to lead the migration to EMV&#174;, the global standard for chip technology, to bring its fraud prevention benefits to our U.S. customers, consumers and merchants. In October 2015, we implemented a new liability hierarchy, making the issuer or merchant with the lowest level of security responsible for the financial impact of any fraudulent transactions they are involved with processing. 

&#8226; 

In 2015, we worked with customers to extend to consumers globally the benefit of &#8220;zero liability&#8221;, or no responsibility for counterfeit or lost card losses, in the event of fraud. 

&#8226; 

In 2015, we launched MasterCard Identity Check&#8482;, a suite of technology solutions that leverage biometrics to help authenticate a consumer&#8217;s identity. 

Financial Inclusion . &#32;&#32;We are focused on addressing financial inclusion, reaching people without access to an electronic account that allows them to store and use money. In 2015, we worked with governments across several geographies to develop and roll out electronic payments solutions and social payment distribution mechanisms. 

Acquisitions and Investments . &#32;&#32;In 2015, we acquired two new businesses focused on expanding our footprint and enhancing critical capabilities, including in the area of data analytics with the acquisition of Applied Predictive Technologies. 

Legal and Regulatory . &#32;&#32;We operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment, with heightened regulatory and legislative scrutiny and other legal challenges, particularly with respect to interchange fees (as discussed below under &#8220;Our Operations and Network&#8221;). Recent developments include: 

&#8226; 

European Union &#32;- In 2015, the European Commission issued a statement of objections related to our interchange fees and central acquiring rules within the European Economic Area. The statement of objections preliminarily concludes that these practices have anticompetitive effects, and the European Commission has indicated it intends to seek fines if it confirms these conclusions. We would not expect the EC to impose fines if we agree to business practice changes that address the EC&#8217;s concerns. Also in 2015, the European Union adopted legislation regulating electronic payments issued and acquired within the European Economic Area, including: 

&#216; 

a cap on consumer credit and debit interchange fees of 30 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively (a significant reduction in fees to financial institutions), with the ability of EU member states to impose more restrictive domestic debit interchange levels; 

&#216; 

restrictions on our &#8220;honor all cards&#8221; rule with respect to products with different levels of interchange; 

&#216; 

a prohibition of surcharging by merchants for products that are subject to regulated interchange rates; 

&#216; 

the prohibition of rules that prevent a consumer from requesting a &#8220;co-badged&#8221; card (that is, a credit or debit card on which an issuer has put a competing brand); and 

&#216; 

the separation of brand and processing in terms of accounting, organization and decision making. 

&#8226; 

Russia &#32;- Effective in 2015, the Russian government amended its National Payments Systems laws to require all payment systems to process domestic transactions through a government-owned payment switch. As a result, all MasterCard domestic transactions in Russia are now processed by that system instead of MasterCard. 

&#8226; 

China &#32;- In 2015, People&#8217;s Bank of China shared preliminary regulations related to international networks&#8217; ability to process domestic payments in China. The regulations, which could require a capital commitment and on-soil provisions for switching, data processing and acceptance, are expected to be finalized in 2016. While we await the final regulations, we continue to execute against our plans to have the infrastructure and technology ready in China to switch domestic Chinese transactions by the end of 2016. In the meantime, we are working to expand issuance and acceptance in the market. 

&#8226; 

Data Privacy &#32;- In 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor treaty that had permitted the transfer of personal data between the European Union and the United States. We have adopted an alternative method of data transfer compliance as a result of this ruling. The situation has not yet been fully resolved and we continue to monitor any other potential requirements that may result, up to and including the need to establish a data processing center in Europe. 

Capital Structure. &#32;&#32;In 2015, we completed several key capital structure efforts as part of our capital planning, including entering into a $3.75 billion credit facility (replacing our previous facility), launching a commercial paper program and completing a euro-denominated bond issuance of 1.65 billion euros. 

See Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of our legal and regulatory developments and risks. 

Our Business 

Our Operations and Network 

We operate the MasterCard Network, our unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the processing of transactions, permitting MasterCard cardholders to use their cards and other payment devices at millions of merchants worldwide. Our network facilitates an efficient and secure means for merchants to receive payments, as well as convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers and businesses that is accepted worldwide. We process transactions through our network for our issuer customers in more than 150 currencies in more than 210 countries and territories. 

Typical Transaction . &#32;&#32;With a typical transaction involving four participants in addition to us, our network supports what is often referred to as a &#8220;four-party&#8221; payments network. The following diagram depicts a typical transaction on our network, and our role in that transaction: 

In a typical transaction, a cardholder purchases goods or services from a merchant using a card or other payment device. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below), and then posts the transaction to the cardholder&#8217;s account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the &#8220;merchant discount&#8221; rate, as further described below), to the merchant. 

Interchange Fees. &#160; Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs consumers and merchants pay. We do not earn revenues from interchange fees. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred by them in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants. We or financial institutions establish &#8220;default interchange fees&#8221; that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process. 

Additional Four-Party System Fees. &#160; The &#8220;merchant discount rate&#8221; is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate, and issuers may also charge cardholders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit. 

Our Network Architecture and Information Security . &#32;&#32;The MasterCard Network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It features an intelligent architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction by blending two distinct processing structures: 

&#8226; 

a distributed (peer-to-peer) processing structure for transactions that require fast, reliable processing to ensure they are processed close to where the transaction occurred; and 

&#8226; 

a centralized (hub-and-spoke) processing structure for transactions that require value-added processing, such as real-time access to transaction data for fraud scoring or rewards at the point-of-sale, to ensure advanced processing products and services are applied to the transaction. 

Our network&#8217;s architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring. It has 24-hour a day availability and world-class response time. The network incorporates multiple layers of protection, both for continuity 

purposes and to address information security challenges. We engage in multiple efforts to mitigate such challenges, including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. 

Participation Standards . &#32;&#32;We establish, apply and enforce standards surrounding participation in the MasterCard payments system. We grant licenses that provide issuers, acquirers and other customers that meet specified criteria with certain rights, including access to the network and usage of cards and payment devices carrying our brands. As a condition of our licenses, issuers, acquirers and other customers agree to comply with our standards surrounding participation and brand usage and acceptance. We monitor areas of risk exposure and enforce our standards to combat fraudulent, illegal and brand-damaging activity. Issuers, acquirers and other customers are also required to report instances of fraud to us in a timely manner so that we can monitor trends and initiate action when appropriate. 

Customer Risk Management. &#32; &#32;We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions between our issuers and acquirers to ensure the integrity of our network. We refer to this as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirer, or the availability of unspent prepaid cardholder account balances. As a guarantor of certain obligations of principal customers, we are exposed to customer credit risk arising from the potential financial failure of any principal customers of MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, and affiliate debit licensees. Principal customers participate directly in MasterCard programs and are responsible for the settlement and other activities of their sponsored affiliate customers. To minimize the contingent risk to MasterCard of a failure of a customer to meet its settlement obligations, we monitor the financial health of, economic and political operating environments of, and compliance with our standards by our customers. We employ various strategies to mitigate these risks. 

Transaction Processing 

Switching 

&#8226; 

Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. &#32;&#32; Through the MasterCard Network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a successfully conducted transaction, and help to settle the transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via settlement banks chosen by us and our customers. 

&#8226; 

Cross-Border and Domestic. &#32;&#32; The MasterCard Network switches transactions throughout the world when the merchant country and issuer country are different (cross-border transactions), providing cardholders with the ability to use, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards and other payment devices across country borders. We also provide domestic (or intra-country) transaction switching services to customers in every region of the world, which allow issuers to facilitate payment transactions between cardholders and merchants within a particular country. We switch approximately half of all transactions using MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards, including most cross-border transactions. We switch the majority of MasterCard and Maestro-branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and a select number of other countries. Outside of these countries, most domestic transactions on our products are switched without our involvement. 

Other Processing. &#32;&#32;We extend our processing capabilities in the payments value chain in various regions and across the globe with an expanded suite of offerings, including: 

&#8226; 

Issuer and acquirer solutions designed to provide medium to large customers with a complete processing solution to help them create differentiated products and services and allow quick deployment of payments portfolios across banking channels. 

&#8226; 

Payment gateways that offer a single interface to provide e-commerce merchants with the ability to process secure payments and offer value-added solutions, including outsourced electronic payments, fraud prevention and alternative payment options. 

&#8226; 

Mobile gateways that facilitate transaction routing and prepaid processing for mobile-initiated transactions for our customers. 

Programs and Solutions 

We provide a wide variety of products and solutions that support payment products that customers can offer to their cardholders. These services facilitate transactions on the MasterCard Network among cardholders, merchants, financial institutions and governments in markets globally.

Consumer Credit and Charge. We offer a number of programs that enable issuers to provide consumers with cards that allow them to defer payment. These programs are designed to meet the needs of our customers around the world and address standard, premium and affluent consumer segments. 

Debit. &#32; &#32;We support a range of payment products and solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit and other accounts. Our debit and deposit access programs can be used to make purchases and to obtain cash in bank branches, at ATMs and, in some cases, at the point of sale. Our branded debit programs consist of MasterCard (including standard, premium and affluent offerings), Maestro (the only PIN-based solution that operates globally) and Cirrus (our primary global cash access solution). 

Prepaid. &#32;&#32;Prepaid programs involve a balance that is funded prior to use and can be accessed via a card or other payment device. We offer prepaid payment programs using any of our brands, which we support with processing products and services. Segments on which we focus include government programs such as Social Security payments, unemployment benefits and others; commercial programs such as payroll, health savings accounts, employee benefits and others; and consumer reloadable programs for individuals without formal banking relationships and non-traditional users of electronic payments. 

We also provide prepaid program management services, primarily outside of the United States, that manage and enable switching and issuer processing for consumer and commercial prepaid travel cards for business partners such as financial institutions, retailers, telecommunications companies, travel agents, foreign exchange bureaus, colleges and universities, airlines and governments. 

Commercial. &#32;&#32;We offer commercial payment products and solutions that help large corporations, mid-sized companies, small businesses and government entities streamline their procurement and payment processes, manage information and expenses (such as travel and entertainment) and reduce administrative costs. Our offerings and platforms include premium, travel, purchasing and fleet cards and programs; our SmartData tool that provides information reporting and expense management capabilities; and credit and debit programs targeted for small businesses. 

Payment Innovations . &#32;&#32;The continued adoption of mobile devices has resulted in the ongoing convergence of the physical and digital worlds, where consumers are increasingly seeking to use their payment accounts to pay when, where and how they want. Leveraging our global innovations capability, we are developing platforms, products and solutions that take advantage of this convergence and give us the opportunity to lead the transition to digital payments. We do this in a number of ways, including: 

&#8226; 

Creating Better Shopping and Selling Experiences. &#32;&#32;We are focused on offering digital solutions, such as our MasterPass digital payments ecosystem and MasterCard Digital Enablement Service (MDES) suite, and other products to make shopping and selling experiences simpler, faster and safer for both consumers and merchants. We also offer products that make it easier for merchants to accept payments and expand their customer base and are developing products and practices to facilitate acceptance via mobile devices. 

&#8226; 

Engaging with New Partners. &#32;&#32;We enable consumers to securely use their smartphones to make digital payments through numerous active partnerships with mobile leaders and large digital companies around the world. Through our Open API Services, developers can innovate and create applications using financial and data services offered through the MasterCard Developer Zone. 

&#8226; 

Facilitating Money Transfers and Personal Payments. &#32;&#32;We provide money transfer and global remittance solutions to enable our customers to facilitate consumers sending and receiving money quickly and securely domestically and around the world. We continue to enhance our personal payments platforms, providing financial institutions connected to our network with additional opportunities for their customers to send funds domestically and globally. 

We also focus on developing the future of payments and delivering additional consumer shopping safety and convenience through MasterCard Labs, our global innovation and development arm. Our efforts include incubating various ideas and hosting thought-leadership events to spur the next generation of innovative payment products. 

Safety and Security 

We offer products and services to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and to ensure the safety of transactions made on MasterCard products. We work with issuers, merchants and governments to help develop standards for safe and secure transactions for the global payments system. We have worked with our financial institution customers to provide products to consumers globally with increased confidence through the benefit of &#8220;zero liability&#8221;, or no responsibility for counterfeit or lost card losses in the event of fraud. 

Our products and solutions include: 

&#8226; 

internet authentication/verification solutions that leverage biometrics; 

&#8226; 

services assisting customers, merchants and third-party service providers in protecting against attacks and subsequent account data compromises; and 

&#8226; 

fraud detection and management products and services. 

We have been leading the development of industry standards, working with many payments industry associations to ensure that payment security standards are put in place as part of our multi-layered approach to protect the global payments system. These efforts include evolving a roadmap for the migration to EMV and developing an industry-open standard for tokenization, which helps protect sensitive cardholder information for digital transactions by generating unique credentials to an identified and verified individual that may be used for a specific transaction. As of December 31, 2015, nearly 50% of all U.S.-issued MasterCard consumer credit and debit cards featured EMV technology and many merchants are turning on the chip capabilities in their terminals. 

Value-Added Solutions 

MasterCard Advisors . &#32;&#32;MasterCard Advisors is our global professional services group that provides proprietary analysis, data-driven consulting and marketing services solutions to help clients optimize, streamline and grow their businesses, as well as deliver value to consumers. With analyses based on billions of transactions processed globally, we leverage anonymized and aggregated information and a consultative approach to help financial institutions, merchants, media companies, governments and other organizations grow their businesses or otherwise achieve efficiencies. 

Our information services group provides a suite of data analytics and products (including reports, benchmarks, models and insights) that enable our customers to make better business decisions. Our consulting services group combines professional problem-solving skills with payments expertise to provide solutions that address the challenges and opportunities of clients with respect to payments. The managed services group provides solutions to enable data-driven acquisition of accounts, activation of portfolios, conversion of cards, marketing promotions activities and other customer management services. 

Loyalty and Rewards Solutions . &#32;&#32;We provide a scalable rewards platform that enables issuers to provide consumers with a variety of benefits and services, such as personalized offers and rewards, access to a global airline lounge network, global and local concierge services, individual insurance coverages, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advance services and a 24-hour cardholder service center. For merchants, we provide targeted offers and rewards campaigns and management services for publishing offers, as well as opportunities for holders of co-brand or loyalty cards and rewards program members to obtain reward points faster. We support these services with program management capabilities. 

Marketing 

We manage and promote our brands through advertising, promotions and sponsorships, as well as digital, mobile and social media initiatives, in order to increase consumer preference for our brands and usage of our products. We sponsor a variety of sporting, entertainment and charity-related marketing properties to align with consumer segments important to us and our 

customers. Our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among cardholders globally. Our &#8220;Priceless&#174;&#8221; advertising campaign, which has run in 53 languages in 112 countries worldwide, promotes MasterCard usage benefits and acceptance, markets MasterCard payment products and solutions and provides MasterCard with a consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand around the globe. We have extended Priceless to create experiences through three platforms to drive brand preference - Priceless Cities&#174; provides cardholders across all of our regions with access to special experiences and offers in various cities, Priceless Causes&#174; provides cardholders with opportunities to support philanthropic causes, and Priceless Surprises&#174; provides cardholders with unexpected and unique surprises. 

Our Revenue Sources 

We generate revenues by assessing our customers primarily based on GDV on the cards and other devices that carry our brands and from the fees we charge to our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related products and services. Our net revenues are classified into five categories: domestic assessment fees, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing fees, other revenues and rebates and incentives (contra-revenue). 

See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenues&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 for more detail about our revenue, GDV and processed transactions. 

Intellectual Property 

We own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates. We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by MasterCard to support our payment programs. Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks in connection with our customers&#8217; issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payments solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, electronic commerce, security systems and other matters, many of which are important to our business operations. Patents are of varying duration depending on the jurisdiction and filing date. 

Competition 

We compete in the global payments industry against all forms of payment including: 

&#8226; 

cash and checks; 

&#8226; 

card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM and prepaid products, as well as limited-use products such as private label; 

&#8226; 

contactless, mobile and e-commerce payments, as well as cryptocurrency; and 

&#8226; 

other electronic payments, including wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers, bill payments and automated clearing house payments (ACH). 

We face a number of competitors both within and outside the global payments industry: 

&#8226; 

Cash and Check . &#32;&#32;Cash and check continue to represent the most widely used forms of payment, constituting approximately 85% of the world&#8217;s retail payment transactions. 

&#8226; 

General Purpose Payment Networks . &#32;We compete worldwide with payment networks such as Visa, American Express and Discover, among others. Among global networks, Visa has significantly greater volume than we do. Outside of the United States, networks such as JCB in Japan and UnionPay in China have leading positions in their domestic markets. In the case of UnionPay, it operates the sole domestic payment switch in China. In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local networks for domestic processing. See our risk factors related to payments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively for a more detailed discussion. 

&#8226; 

Debit. &#32;&#32;We compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks in various countries, such as Interlink&#174;, Plus&#174; and Visa Electron&#174; (owned by Visa Inc.), Star&#174; (owned by First Data Corporation), NYCE&#174; (owned by FIS) and Pulse&#174; (owned by Discover) in the United States; Interac in Canada; EFTPOS in Australia; and Bankserv in South Africa. In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions, which typically represent a small portion of overall transaction volume. Jurisdictions have also created domestic card schemes that are focused mostly on debit and driven by nationalism (including RuPay in India and MIR in Russia). 

&#8226; 

Three-Party Payments Networks. &#32;&#32;Our competitors include operators of proprietary three-party payments networks, such as American Express and Discover, which have direct acquiring relationships with merchants and direct issuing relationships with account holders. These competitors have certain competitive advantages over four-party payments systems such as ours. Among other things, these networks do not require formal interchange fees to balance payment system costs between the issuing and acquiring sides of their business, even though they have the ability to internally transfer costs in a manner similar to interchange fees. As a result, to date, operators of three-party payments networks have avoided some of the regulatory and litigation challenges we face. 

&#8226; 

Competition for Customer Business . &#32;&#32;We compete intensely with other payments networks for customer business. Globally, financial institutions typically issue both MasterCard and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or programs. In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system. &#32;&#32; We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products. We also compete for non-financial institution partners, such as merchants, governments and telecommunication companies. 

&#8226; 

Third-Party Processors . &#32;&#32;We face competition and potential displacement from transaction processors throughout the world, such as First Data Corporation and Total System Services, Inc., which are seeking to enhance their networks that link issuers directly with point-of-sale devices for payment transaction authorization and processing services. 

&#8226; 

Alternative Payments Systems and New Entrants . &#32;&#32;As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we may face increasing competition from emerging payment providers. Many of these providers have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels; however, they either have or may expand to other channels. These competitors include digital wallet providers (such as PayPal, Alipay and Amazon), mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services (such as mPesa), handset manufacturers and cryptocurrencies. We compete with these providers in some circumstances, but in some cases they may also be our customers or partner with us. 

&#8226; 

Value-Added Solutions. &#32;&#32;We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value-added solutions, including information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, as well as companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty and program management solutions. 

Our competitive advantages include: 

&#8226; 

our globally recognized brands; 

&#8226; 

our highly adaptable network that we believe is the world&#8217;s fastest; 

&#8226; 

our adoption of innovative products and digital solutions; 

&#8226; 

our MasterPass global digital payments ecosystem; 

&#8226; 

the safety and security solutions embedded in our network; 

&#8226; 

our MasterCard Advisors group dedicated solely to the payments industry; and 

&#8226; 

our ability to serve a broad array of participants in global payments due to our expanded on-soil presence in individual markets and a heightened focus on working with governments. 

Government Regulation 

General. &#32;&#32; Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our cards and payment devices are used. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A for more detail and examples. 

Interchange Fees. &#32;&#32;Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and litigation. For more detail, see our risk factors in &#8220;Risk Factors-Payments System Legal and Regulatory Challenges&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A. Also see Note 18 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. 

Payments System Regulation . &#32;&#32;Regulators in several countries around the world either have, or are seeking to establish, authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in their countries. Such authority could result in regulation of various aspects of our business. Additionally, we are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers. For example, certain of our operations are periodically reviewed by the U.S. Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council under its authority to examine financial institutions&#8217; technology service providers. 

Preferential or Protective Government Actions. &#32;&#32;Some governments have taken actions to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as create their own national providers. 

No-Surcharge Rules. &#32;&#32;We have historically implemented policies in certain regions that prohibit merchants from charging higher prices to consumers who pay using MasterCard products instead of other means. Authorities in several jurisdictions have acted to end or limit the application of these no-surcharge rules (or indicated interest in doing so), including in Australia and Canada. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of settlement of the U.S. merchant class litigation, we have modified our no-surcharge rules to permit U.S. merchants to surcharge credit cards, subject to certain limitations. 

Data Protection and Information Security. &#32; Aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection laws in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere. For example, in the United States, we and our customers are respectively subject to Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program. Due to constant changes to the nature of data, regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux. This includes the recent ruling by the European Court of Justice that invalidated the EU-U.S. Safe Harbor treaty and the newly announced EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. 

Anti-Money Laundering. &#160; MasterCard is subject to anti-money laundering (&#8220;AML&#8221;) laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act. We have implemented a comprehensive AML program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity. Our AML compliance program is comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks. 

Economic Sanctions . &#160; We are subject to regulations imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) restricting financial transactions and other dealings with Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Sudan and with persons and entities included in OFAC&#8217;s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the &#8220;SDN List&#8221;). Iran, Syria and Sudan have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states. We have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries or in the Crimea region and do not license financial institutions domiciled there. We have established a risk-based compliance program that includes policies, procedures and controls that are designed to prevent us from having business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities. This includes obligating issuers and acquirers to screen cardholders and merchants, respectively, against the SDN list. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau . &#32;&#32;The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the United States, including consumer credit, deposit, payment and similar products. 

Central Bank Oversight . &#32;&#32;Several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world that have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry are in some cases considering designating them as &#8220;systemically important payment systems&#8221; or &#8220;critical infrastructure.&#8221; This includes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;) in the United States. Such systems will be subject to new regulation, supervision and examination requirements. To date, MasterCard has not been designated &#8220;systemically important.&#8221; 

Issuer Practice Regulation. &#32;&#32; Our customers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks and other financial institutions in their capacity as issuers and otherwise, impacting MasterCard as a consequence. Such regulations and investigations have been related to campus cards, bank overdraft practices, fees issuers charge to cardholders and transparency of terms and conditions. 

Regulation of Internet and Digital Transactions . &#32;&#32;Various jurisdictions have enacted or have proposed regulation related to internet transactions. For example, under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in the United States, payment transactions must be coded and blocked for certain types of Internet gambling transactions. The legislation applies to payments system participants, including MasterCard and our U.S. customers, and is implemented through a federal regulation. We may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding gambling, including fantasy sports. Jurisdictions are also considering regulatory initiatives in digital-related areas that could impact us, such as cyber-security, copyright and trademark infringement and privacy. 

Additional Regulatory Developments. &#32;&#32;Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us, including evolving laws surrounding marijuana, prepaid payroll cards, virtual currencies, payment card add-on products, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact our customers directly.
