Wholesale Accessories Segment 

Our Wholesale Accessories segment designs, sources and markets name brands (including our Steve Madden&#174;, Steven by Steve Madden&#174;, Madden Girl&#174;, Betsey Johnson&#174;, Betseyville&#174;, Big Buddha&#174;, B Brian Atwood&#174; and Luv Betsey&#174; brands) and private label fashion handbags and accessories to department stores, mass merchants, value priced retailers, online retailers and specialty stores throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. In addition, we market and sell cold weather accessories, 

fashion scarves, wraps and other trend accessories primarily under our Cejon&#174; and Steve Madden&#174; brand names and private labels to department stores and specialty stores. 

Retail Segment 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned and operated &#32; 169 &#32;retail stores including 123 &#32;Steve Madden full price stores, 40 &#32;Steve Madden outlet stores, one &#32;Steven store, one &#32;Superga store, one SHOO by Steve Madden store offering a variety of the Company's brands and four &#32;e-commerce websites (Steve Madden, Superga, Betsey Johnson and Dolce Vita). In 2015 , we opened seven &#32;new full price stores, eight &#32;new outlet stores and closed six &#32;stores, including five full price stores in the United States and one full price store in Mexico. Steve Madden stores are located in major shopping malls and in urban street locations across the United States, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. Comparative store sales (sales of those stores, including the e-commerce websites, that were open for all of 2015 &#32;and 2014 ) increased 11.2% &#32;in fiscal year 2015 &#32;from the prior year. The Company excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first year of operations. Stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base. 

We anticipate that the Retail segment can enhance the Company's overall sales and profitability while increasing recognition for our brands. Additionally, our retail stores enable us to evaluate the appeal of new products and designs to our customers and respond accordingly, which, in turn, strengthens the product development efforts of our two Wholesale segments. We expect to open 17 &#32;to 20 &#32;new retail stores in 2016 . 

First Cost Segment 

The First Cost segment earns commissions for serving as a buying agent for footwear products under private labels for many of the large mass-market merchandisers, shoe chains and other mid-tier retailers. As a buying agent, we utilize our expertise and our relationships with shoe manufacturers to facilitate the production of private label shoes to customer specifications. We believe that by operating in the private label, mass merchandising market provides us additional non-branded sales opportunities and leverages our overall sourcing and design capabilities. Currently, our First Cost segment earns commissions serving as a buying agent for the procurement of women's, men's and children's footwear for large retailers, including, Kohl's, K-Mart and Payless. In addition, by leveraging the strength of our Steve Madden brands and product designs, we have been able to partially recover our design, product and development costs from our suppliers. 

Licensing Segment 

We license our Steve Madden&#174;, Steven by Steve Madden&#174; and Madden Girl&#174; trademarks for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of outerwear, hosiery, activewear, sleepwear, jewelry, watches, hair accessories, umbrellas, bedding, luggage, and men&#8217;s leather accessories. In addition, the Company licenses the Betsey Johnson&#174;, Betseyville&#174; and Dolce Vita&#174; trademarks for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of women's and children&#8217;s apparel, hosiery, swimwear, outerwear, sleepwear, activewear, jewelry, watches, bedding, luggage, stationary, umbrellas, and household goods. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to pay us a royalty based on actual net sales, a minimum royalty in the event that specified net sales targets are not achieved and a percentage of sales for advertising the brand. 

See Note P to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information relating to our five operating segments. 

Product Design and Development 

We have established a reputation for our creative designs, marketing and trendy products at affordable price points. Our future success will substantially depend on our ability to continue to anticipate and react swiftly to changing consumer demands. To meet this objective, we have developed what we believe is an unparalleled design process that allows us to recognize and respond quickly to changing consumer demands. Our design team strives to create designs that fit our image, reflect current or anticipated trends and can be manufactured in a timely and cost-effective manner. Most new Steve Madden products are tested in select Steve Madden retail stores. Based on these tests, among other things, management selects the Steve Madden products that are then offered for wholesale and retail distribution nationwide. We believe that our design and testing processes and flexible sourcing models provide the Steve Madden brands with a significant competitive advantage allowing us to mitigate the risk of incurring costs associated with the production and distribution of less desirable designs. 

Product Sourcing and Distribution 

We source each of our product lines separately based on the individual design, style and quality specifications of the products in such product lines. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities; rather, we use agents and our own sourcing office to source our products from independently-owned manufacturers in China, Mexico, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam and Italy. We have established relationships with a number of manufacturers and agents in each of these countries. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply contracts. We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist for the manufacture of our products. 

We continually monitor the availability of the principal raw materials used in our footwear, which are currently available from a number of sources in various parts of the world. We track inventory flow on a regular basis, monitor sell-through data and incorporate input on product demand from wholesale customers. We use retailers' feedback to adjust the production of products on a timely basis, which helps reduce the close out of slow-moving products. 

The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, safety and other standard requirements. We are committed to the safety and well-being of the workers throughout our supply chain. 

Our products are manufactured overseas and a majority of our products filling domestic orders are shipped via ocean freight carriers to ports in California, New Jersey and Texas with the greatest reliance on the California ports. To a lesser extent we rely on air and ground freight carriers for the shipping of products. Once our products arrive in the U.S., we distribute them mainly from four third-party distribution centers, two located in California, one located in Texas and one located in New Jersey and through two Company-operated distribution centers located in New Jersey and Canada. By utilizing distribution facilities specializing in distribution fulfillment to effect distribution to certain wholesale accounts, Steve Madden retail stores and Internet customers, we believe that our customers are served more promptly and efficiently. For our international markets, products for our businesses in Canada and Mexico are shipped to ports in the respective countries, and products for our overseas distributors are shipped to freight forwarders in China where the distributor arranges for subsequent shipment. 

Customers 

Our wholesale customers consist principally of better department stores, major department stores, mid-tier department stores, national chains, mass merchants, value priced retailers, specialty stores, online retailers and catalog retailers. These customers include, Target, Macy's, Nordstrom, Ross, DSW, Payless, TJ Maxx, Walmart, Kohl's and Burlington Coat Factory. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , Target, Inc. represented 12.2% &#32;of net sales and 16.7% &#32;of total accounts receivable. The Company did not have any other customers who accounted for more than 10% &#32;of total net sales or 10% &#32;of total accounts receivable. 

&#160; 

Distribution Channels 

United States, Canada, Mexico and South Africa 

We sell our products principally through department stores, specialty stores, online retailers, luxury retailers, national chains and mass merchants and in our Company-owned retail stores in the United States, Canada, Mexico and South Africa and our e-commerce websites. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our Retail segment and our two Wholesale segments generated net sales of approximately $240,312 &#32;and $1,164,927 , or 17% &#32;and 83% &#32;of our total net sales, respectively. Each of these distribution channels is described below. 

Steve Madden, Steve Madden Outlet, Steven and Superga Retail Stores. &#32;&#32;As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 123 &#32;Steve Madden full price stores, 40 &#32;Steve Madden outlet stores, one &#32;Steven store, one &#32;Superga store and four &#32;e-commerce websites (Steve Madden, Superga, Betsey Johnson and Dolce Vita). We believe that our retail stores will continue to enhance overall sales, profitability, and our ability to react swiftly to changing consumer trends. Our stores also serve as a marketing tool that allows us to strengthen brand recognition and to showcase selected items from our full line of branded and licensed products. Furthermore, our retail stores provide us with venues through which to test and introduce new products, designs and merchandising strategies. Specifically, we often test new designs at our Steve Madden retail stores before scheduling them for mass production and wholesale distribution. In addition to these test marketing benefits, we have been able to leverage sales information gathered at Steve Madden retail stores to assist our wholesale customers in order placement and inventory management. 

A typical Steve Madden store is approximately 1,500 to 2,000 square feet and is located in a mall or street location that we expect will attract the highest concentration of our core demographic, style-conscious customer base. The Steven and Superga 

stores, which are generally the same size as our Steve Madden stores, have a more sophisticated design and format styled to appeal to a more mature target audience. The typical outlet store is approximately 2,000 to 2,500 square feet and is located within outlet malls throughout the United States. In addition to carefully analyzing mall demographics and locations, we set profitability guidelines for each potential store site. Specifically, we target well trafficked sites at which the demographics fit our consumer profile and seek new locations where the projected fixed annual rent expense stays within our guidelines. By setting these guidelines, we seek to identify stores that will contribute to our overall profitability both in the near and longer terms. 

Department Stores. We currently sell to over 2,500 doors of 17 department stores throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our major accounts include Macy's, Nordstrom, Dillard's, Belk and Lord &#38; Taylor. 

We provide merchandising support to our department store customers including, in-store fixtures and signage, supervision of displays and merchandising of our various product lines. Our wholesale merchandising effort includes the creation of in-store concept shops in which to showcase a broader collection of our branded products. These in-store concept shops create an environment that is consistent with our image and are designed to enable the retailer to display and sell a greater volume of our products per square foot of retail space. In addition, these in-store concept shops encourage longer term commitment by the retailer to our products and enhance consumer brand awareness. 

In addition to merchandising support, our key account executives maintain weekly communications with their respective accounts to guide them in placing orders and to assist them in managing inventory, assortment and retail sales. We leverage our sell-through data gathered at our retail stores to assist department stores in allocating their open-to-buy dollars to the most popular styles in the product line and phasing out styles with weaker sell-throughs, which, in turn, reduces markdown exposure at season's end. 

National chains and mass merchants. We currently sell to national chains and mass merchants throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our major accounts include Target, Walmart, Kohl's, J.C. Penney and Sears. 

Specialty Stores/Catalog Sales. We currently sell to specialty store locations throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. Our major specialty store accounts include DSW, Famous Footwear and Journeys. &#32; &#32;We offer our specialty store accounts the same merchandising, sell-through and inventory tracking support offered to our department store accounts. Sales of our products are also made through various catalogs, such &#32; as Bloomingdale's and Victoria's Secret. 

Internet Sales. &#32;&#32;We operate four Internet e-commerce website stores (Steve Madden, Superga, Betsey Johnson and Dolce Vita) where customers can purchase numerous styles of our Steve Madden Women's, Steven, Madden Men's, FREEBIRD by Steven, Superga, Betsey Johnson and Dolce Vita, as well as selected styles of Madden Girl, footwear and accessory products. We also sell to online retailers throughout the United States and Canada. Our major accounts include Zappos and Amazon. 

International 

Our products are available in many countries and territories worldwide via retail selling and distribution agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, the distributors and retailers purchase product from the Company and are generally required to open a minimum number of stores each year and to pay a fee for each pair of footwear purchased and an additional sales royalty as a percentage of sales or a predetermined amount per unit of sale. Most of the distributors are required to purchase a minimum number of products within specified periods. The agreements currently in place expire on various dates through &#32; February 14, 2031 and include automatic renewals at the distributors' option provided certain conditions are met. These agreements are exclusive in their specific territories, which include &#32; Asia, Australia, Europe, India, the Middle East, South and Central America and New Zealand. 

Competition 

The fashion industry is highly competitive. We compete with specialty shoe and accessory companies as well as companies with diversified footwear product lines, such as &#32; Nine West, Jessica Simpson, Guess, Ugg and Aldo. Our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do. We believe effective advertising and marketing, favorable brand image, fashionable styling, high quality, value and fast manufacturing turnaround are the most important competitive factors and intend to continue to employ these elements in our business. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Marketing and Sales 

We have focused on creating an integrated brand building program to establish Steve Madden as a leading designer of fashion footwear for style-conscious young women and men. Principal marketing activities include product placements in life style and fashion magazines, personal appearances by our founder and Creative and Design Chief, Steve Madden, and in-store promotions. We continue to promote our e-commerce websites where customers can purchase Steve Madden Women's, Steven, Madden Men's, FREEBIRD by Steven, Superga, Betsey Johnson and Dolce Vita, as well as selected styles of Madden Girl, footwear and accessory products, as well as view exclusive content, participate in contests and &#8220;live chat&#8221; with customer service representatives. We also connect with our customers through social media forums including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. 

&#160; 

Management Information Systems (MIS) Operations 

Sophisticated information systems are essential to our ability to maintain our competitive position and to support continued growth. Our wholesale information system is an Enterprise Resource Planning (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) system. This integrated system supports our wholesale business in the areas of finance and accounting, manufacturing-sourcing, purchase order management, customer order management and inventory control. We completed the implementation of this new ERP system for our wholesale business in 2014. During 2015, we completed the implementation of such ERP system in three of our acquired businesses and are currently in the process of implementing the ERP system for one of our U.S.-based wholesale businesses and its Asia first-cost and sourcing operation as well as our Mexico business. In 2014 we completed the implementation of a new warehouse management system that is utilized by our third-party logistics providers. During 2015 we implemented this warehouse management system in a company-owned warehouse. This warehouse management system interfaces with our ERP system. We have a new business-to-consumer e-commerce software platform that we are currently in the process of implementing as to businesses acquired. We are also currently implementing a point of sale system for our retail stores that is integrated with a retail inventory management/store replenishment system. Complimenting all of these systems are ancillary systems and third-party information processing services including, among others, supply chain, business intelligence/data warehouse, Electronic Data Interchange, credit card processing and payroll. We undertake updates of all of these information management systems on a periodic basis in order to ensure that our functionality is continuously improved. 

Intellectual Property 

Trademarks 

We consider our trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and have registered many of our marks in the United States and 94 other countries and in numerous International Classes. From time to time we adopt new trademarks and new logos and/or stylized versions of our trademarks in connection with the marketing of new product lines. We believe that these trademarks have significant value and are important for purposes of identifying the Company, the marketing of our products and the products of our licensees, distinguishing them from the products of others. What follows is a list of the trademarks we believe are most significant to our business:

We act aggressively to register trademarks and we monitor their use in order to protect them against infringement. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to effectively obtain rights to our marks throughout all of the world. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, our marks and other proprietary rights or that we will be able to resolve any such conflicts successfully. Our failure to adequately protect our trademarks from unlawful and improper appropriation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 

Trademark Licensing 

Our strategy for the continued growth of the Company's business includes expanding the Company's presence beyond footwear and accessories through the selective licensing of our brands. As of December 31, 2015 , we license our Steve Madden&#174;, Steven by Steve Madden&#174;, and Madden Girl&#174; trademarks for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of outerwear, hosiery, activewear, sleepwear, jewelry, watches, hair accessories, umbrellas, bedding, luggage, and men&#8217;s leather accessories. In addition, the Company licenses the Betsey Johnson&#174;, Betseyville&#174;, and Dolce Vita&#174; trademarks for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of women's and children&#8217;s apparel, hosiery, swimwear, outerwear, sleepwear, activewear, jewelry, watches, bedding, luggage, stationary, umbrellas, and household goods. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to pay us a royalty based on actual net sales, a minimum royalty in the event that specified net sales targets are not achieved and a percentage of sales for advertising the brand. 

In addition to the licensing of our trademarks, we also license the trademarks of third parties for use in connection with certain of our product lines. Through a license agreement with Basic Properties America Inc. and BasicNet S.p.A we have the right to use the Superga&#174; trademark in connection with the marketing and sale of footwear through December 31, 2022. This licensing agreement requires us to make royalty and advertising payments to the licensor equal to a percentage of our net sales or a minimum royalty and advertising payment in the event that specified net sales targets are not achieved. See Notes A and O to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure regarding these licensing arrangements. 

Employees 

On February 1, 2016 , we employed approximately 3,578 employees, of whom approximately 2,260 work on a full-time basis and approximately 1,318 work on a part-time basis. Most of our part-time employees work in the Retail segment. Approximately 2,437 of our employees are located in the United States, approximately 696 employees are located in Hong Kong and China, approximately 331 employees are located in Canada and approximately 114 employees are located in Mexico. None of our employees are represented by a union. Our management considers relations with our employees to be good. The Company has never experienced a material interruption of its operations due to a labor dispute. 

Seasonality 

Historically, some of our businesses, including our Retail segment, have experienced holiday retail seasonality. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of larger shipments of footwear, market acceptance of our products, product mix, pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold, the hiring and training of additional personnel, inventory write downs for obsolescence, the cost of materials, the product mix among our wholesale, retail and licensing businesses, the incurrence of other operating costs and factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions and actions of competitors. 

Backlog 

We had unfilled wholesale customer orders of approximately $295,000 and $312,000, as of February 1, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. &#32;&#32; Our backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, timing of market weeks and wholesale customer purchases of our core products through our open stock program. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period may not be indicative of eventual shipments.
