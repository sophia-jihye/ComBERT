 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Background 

&#160; 

We develop, manufacture, market and sell natural non-alcoholic carbonated soft drinks, Kombucha, candies and ice creams. We currently manufacture, license, market and sell several unique product lines: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Virgil&#8217;s Root Beer, Cream Sodas, Dr. Better and Real Cola, including ZERO diet sodas, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Culture Club Kombucha, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; China Colas, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Ginger candy and ice creams, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Sonoma Sparkler and other juice based products. &#160; &#160; &#160; We also have a private label business. 

&#160; 

We sell our products throughout the US and in select international markets. We started in specialty gourmet and natural food stores and have moved more into mainstream over time. We estimate that our products are in approximately 40,000 accounts in the US with approximately 12,000 of those being mainstream supermarkets. We sell our products through a network of natural, gourmet and beer distributors and direct to certain large national retailers. 

&#160; 

We produce and co-pack our beverage products in part at our facility in Los Angeles, California, known as the Brewery and at contracted co-packing facilities in Pennsylvania and Indiana. These co-pack facilities typically service the eastern half of the United States and nationally for certain products that we do not produce at The Brewery. 

&#160; 

Key elements of our business strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; increase our relationship with and sales to the approximately 15,000 supermarkets that carry our products in natural and mainstream and capture more of the 35,000 supermarkets nationwide, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; expand our distribution network by adding regional direct store delivery (DSD&#8217;s) and additional direct accounts, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; stimulate consumer demand and awareness for our existing brands and products through promotions and advertising, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; develop additional product flavors under our brands (brand extensions) and other new products, including specialty packaging and alternative uses for our products, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; develop and produce private-label products for select customers, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; lower our cost of sales for our products by gaining economies of scale in our purchasing, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; optimize the size and focus of our sales force to manage our relationships with distributors and retail outlets. &#160; 

We create consumer demand for our products by: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; supporting in-store sampling programs of our products, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; generating free press through public relations, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; advertising in store publications, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; maintaining a company website ( www.reedsinc.com ), and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; active social media campaigns on facebook.com, twitter.com and youtube.com, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; participating in large public events as sponsors, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; in the recent past deployed a national television commercial on cable television networks. &#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located at 13000 South Spring Street, Los Angeles, California 90061. Our telephone number is (310) 217-9400. Our Internet address is (www.reedsinc.com).

&#160; 

Historical Development 

&#160; 

Reed&#8217;s Original Ginger Brew was created in 1987 by Christopher J. Reed, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, and was introduced to the market in Southern California stores in 1989. By 1990, we began marketing our products through United Natural Foods Inc. (UNFI) and other natural food distributors and moved our production to a larger facility in Boulder, Colorado. 

&#160; 

In 1991, we incorporated our business operations in the state of Florida under the name of Original Beverage Corporation and moved all of our production to a co-pack facility in Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1990&#8217;s, we continued to develop and launch new Ginger Brew varieties. Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews reached broad placement in natural and gourmet foods stores nationwide through UNFI and other major specialty, natural/gourmet and mainstream food and beverage distributors. 

&#160; 

In 1997, we began licensing the products of China Cola and eventually acquired the rights to that product in 2000. In 1999, we purchased the Virgil&#8217;s Root Beer brand from the Crowley Beverage Company. In 2000, we moved into an 18,000 square foot warehouse property, the Brewery, in Los Angeles, California, to house our west coast production and warehouse facility. The Brewery also serves as our principal executive offices. In 2001, pursuant to a reincorporation merger, we changed our state of incorporation to Delaware and also changed our name to &#8220;Reed&#8217;s, Inc.&#8221; 

&#160; 

On December 12, 2006, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $4.00 per share in our initial public offering. The public offering resulted in gross proceeds of $8,000,000. Following the public offering, we expanded sales and operations dramatically, initially using a direct store delivery strategy in Southern California, along with other regional independent direct store distributors (DSD). The relationships with DSD&#8217;s were supported by our sales staff. In 2007 we raised a net of $7,600,000 in a private placement. We re-focused our sales strategy to eliminate company direct store delivery sales and to expand sales to DSD&#8217;s and natural food distributors on a national level. We also started selling directly to supermarket grocery stores, which has become a significant portion of our business today. 

&#160; 

We continually introduce new products and line extensions, such as our California Juice Company products in 2009, Virgil&#8217;s diet line of ZERO beverages introduced in 2010 and Dr. Better and Light 55 Calories Extra Ginger Brew in 2011. We commenced offering private label products in 2010 and in 2012 we launched our Culture Club Kombucha line that has been expanded as sales have grown. In 2015 we launched Stronger Ginger Brew that contains 50% more fresh ginger than our best selling Reed&#8217;s Extra Ginger Brew. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

We offer natural premium carbonated soft drinks (CSD), which are a growing segment of the estimated $10 billion CSD market nationwide. Within natural food store markets, we are among the top-selling natural soft drinks. This market is steady and growing. We also sell in major grocery chains nationally. The trend in grocery stores is to expand offerings of natural products and we have the scale and capability to develop these direct customer relationships. 

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

We primarily manufacture and sell beverages and candies or other ginger related products. We make all of our products using premium all-natural ingredients and our beverage line is GMO free. Our primary brands are our Reed&#8217;s ginger brew line, our Virgil&#8217;s line of root beer and our Culture Club Kombucha. Our candy products that include Reed&#8217;s Crystallized Ginger Candy and Reed&#8217;s Chews represent a lesser portion of revenues. We have sold ginger ice cream in prior years. 

&#160; 

Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews 

&#160; 

Ginger ale is the oldest known soft drink. Before modern soft drink technology existed, non-alcoholic beverages were brewed at home directly from herbs, roots, spices, and fruits. These handcrafted brews were highly prized for their taste and their tonic, health-giving properties. Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews are a revival of this lost art of home brewing sodas. We make them with care and attention to wholesomeness and quality, using the finest fresh herbs, roots, spices, and fruits. 

&#160; 

We believe that Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews are unique in their kettle-brewed origin among all mass-marketed soft drinks. Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews contain between 8 and 39 grams of fresh ginger in every 12-ounce bottle. We use pure cane sugar as the sweetener. Our products differ from commercial soft drinks in three particular characteristics: sweetening, carbonation and coloring for greater adult appeal. Instead of using injected-based carbonation, we produce our carbonation naturally, through slower, beer-oriented techniques. This process produces smaller, longer lasting bubbles that do not dissipate rapidly when the bottle is opened. We do not add coloring. The color of our products comes naturally from herbs, fruits, spices, roots and juices and our beverages are GMO free. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In addition, since Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews are pasteurized, they do not require or contain any preservatives. In contrast, modern commercial soft drinks generally are produced using natural and artificial flavor concentrates prepared by flavor laboratories, tap water, and highly refined sweeteners. Typically, manufacturers make a centrally processed concentrate that will lend itself to a wide variety of situations, waters and filling systems. The final product is generally cold-filled and requires preservatives for stability. Colors are added that are either natural, although highly processed, or artificial. 

&#160; 

Our Reed&#8217;s line contains the following products: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Original Ginger Brew was our first creation and is a Jamaican recipe for homemade ginger ale using 17 grams of fresh ginger root, lemon, lime, honey, raw cane sugar, pineapple, herbs and spices. Reed&#8217;s Original Ginger Brew is 20% fruit juice. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Premium Ginger Brew is sweetened only with honey and pineapple juice. Reed&#8217;s Premium Ginger Brew is 20% fruit juice and contains 17 grams of fresh ginger root. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Raspberry Ginger Brew is brewed from 17 grams of fresh ginger root, raspberry juice and lime. Reed&#8217;s Raspberry Ginger Brew is 20% raspberry juice. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Spiced Apple Brew uses 8 grams of fresh ginger root, the finest tart German apple juice and such apple pie spices as cinnamon, cloves and allspice. Reed&#8217;s Spiced Apple Brew is 50% apple juice. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Cherry Ginger Brew is naturally brewed from 17 grams of fresh ginger root, cherry juice from concentrate and spices. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Light 55 Calories Extra Ginger Brew is a reduced calorie version of our top selling Reed&#8217;s Extra Ginger Brew that was made possible by using Stevia. We use the same recipe of 26 grams of fresh ginger root, honey, pineapple, lemon and lime juices and exotic spices. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; &#160; Reeds Extra Ginger Brew is the same recipe as Original Ginger Brew, but has 26 grams of fresh ginger root for a stronger bite. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reeds Stronger Ginger Brew has 50% more ginger than the Extra Ginger Brew and has the highest ginger content of any of our beverage products. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Natural Energy Elixir is an energy drink infused with all natural ingredients designed to provide consumers with a healthy and natural boost to energy levels &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Reed&#8217;s Nausea Relief is based on our Ginger Brews with added B vitamins. Both ginger and B vitamins have been studied for their effectiveness in combating nausea. &#160; 

Virgil&#8217;s Root Beer 

&#160; 

Virgil&#8217;s is a premium craft root beer. We use all-natural ingredients, including filtered water, unbleached cane sugar, anise from Spain, licorice from France, bourbon vanilla from Madagascar, cinnamon from Sri Lanka, clove from Indonesia, wintergreen from China, sweet birch and molasses from the southern United States, nutmeg from Indonesia, pimento berry oil from Jamaica, balsam oil from Peru and cassia oil from China. We collect these ingredients worldwide and gather them together at the brewing and bottling facilities. We combine these ingredients under strict specifications and finally heat-pasteurize Virgil&#8217;s Root Beer, to ensure quality. We sell Virgil&#8217;s Root Beer in three packaging styles: 12-ounce bottles in a four-pack, a special swing-lid style pint bottle and a 5-liter self-tapping party keg. The Virgil&#8217;s soda line is GMO free. 

&#160; 

In addition to our Virgil&#8217;s Root Beer, we also offer the following products under our Virgil&#8217;s brand: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Virgil&#8217;s Cream Soda, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Virgil&#8217;s Orange Cream Soda, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Virgil&#8217;s Black Cherry Cream Soda, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Virgil&#8217;s Real Cola, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Virgil&#8217;s Dr. Better, &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Virgil&#8217;s ZERO line, including Root Beer, Cream Soda, Real Cola, Dr. Better and Black Cherry Cream Soda. (Our ZERO line is naturally sweetened with Stevia), and &#160; 

Reed&#8217;s Culture Club Kombucha 

&#160; 

We introduced our Culture Club Kombucha in 2012. Kombucha is a fermented tea that dates its origin back thousands of years. Among consumers, Kombucha is believed to have healing and cleansing characteristics. Sweetened tea is introduced to a &#8220;starter&#8221; culture and lightly fermented to produce an acetic drink. We make the finest Kombucha possible, using a combination of Oolong and Yerba Mate teas, spring water and a combination of ginger, organic juices and flavors Initially, we produced four flavors, Goji Ginger, Hibiscus Ginger Grapefruit, Lemon Ginger Raspberry and Cranberry Ginger. We introduced four additional flavors in 2013, Pomegranate Ginger, Coconut Water Lime, Cabernet Grape, and Passion Mango Ginger. In 2014, we added the first Coffee Kombucha. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Other Beverage Brands 

&#160; 

We have other popular brands that currently have limited distribution, including China Cola, California Juice, Sonoma Sparkler and Flying Cauldron Butterscotch Beer. We are continually developing new brands and products. 

&#160; 

Private Label Products 

&#160; 

We design and manufacture drinks for private label customers in multiple facilities. We are experts in flavor development and in matching existing products in the market. We develop the recipe and may design the label and/or the bottle style. We do not private label any of our own branded product recipes. 

&#160; 

Our private label products have been primarily sparkling juices, waters and teas. We develop the sources for glass and ingredients. We have a variety of packaging options, including swing-lid bottles, foil capsules and various label types. Our Los Angeles facility is certified as SQF level 2 compliant. 

&#160; 

New Product Development 

&#160; 

We are always working on ideas and products to continue expanding our Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews, Virgil&#8217;s product line, Reed&#8217;s Ginger Candy product lines and packaging styles. Among the advantages of our self-operated Brewery are the flexibility to try innovative packaging and the capability to experiment with new product flavors at less cost to our operations or capital. 

&#160; 

Our private label products require continual product development. We are able to be nimble and innovative, producing new products in a short amount of time. 

&#160; 

Manufacture of Our Products 

&#160; 

We produce our carbonated beverages in multiple facilities: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; a facility in Los Angeles, California, known as The Brewery, at which we currently produce Kombucha, certain soda products and our private label products, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; two packing, or co-pack facilities in Pennsylvania and an additional co-packer in Indiana which supplies us with product we do not produce at The Brewery. The co-packer assembles our products and charges us a fee, generally by the case, for the products they produce. &#160; 

We follow a &#8220;fill as needed&#8221; manufacturing model to the best of our ability and we have no significant backlog of orders. Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our contract packers in accordance with our specifications. Reed&#8217;s Crystallized Ginger is made to our specifications in Fiji. Reed&#8217;s Ginger Candy Chews are made and packed to our specifications in Indonesia. 

&#160; 

Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and each ingredient has several reliable suppliers. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. As a general policy, we pick ingredients in the development of our products that have multiple suppliers and are common ingredients. This provides a level of protection against a major supply constriction or calamity. 

&#160; 

We believe that as we continue to grow, we will be able to keep up with increased production demands. The LA Brewery is currently undergoing a major renovation that we believe will allow the Brewery to handle increased West Coast business. To the extent that any significant increase in business requires us to supplement or substitute our current co-packers, we are developing a pre-qualification for all prospective co-packers, so that there would not be a significant delay or interruption in fulfilling orders and delivery of our products. In addition, we do not believe that growth will result in any significant difficulty or delay in obtaining raw materials, ingredients or finished product that is repackaged at the Brewery. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Primary Markets 

&#160; 

We target a niche in the estimated $100 billion carbonated and non-carbonated soft drink markets in the US, Canada and International markets. Our brands are generally regarded as premium and natural, with upscale packaging and are loosely defined as the artisanal (craft), premium bottled carbonated soft drink category. 

&#160; 

The soft drink industry is highly fragmented and the craft soft drink category consists of such competitors as, Henry Weinhards, Thomas Kemper, Hansen&#8217;s, Izze, Boylan and Jones Soda, to name a few. These brands have the advantage of being seen widely in the national market and being commonly known for years through well-funded ad campaigns. Despite our products having a relatively high price for an artisanal premium beverage product, minimal mass media advertising and a relatively small but growing presence in the mainstream market compared to many of our competitors, we believe that results to date demonstrate that Reed&#8217;s Ginger Brews and Virgil&#8217;s sodas are making strong inroads and market share gains against some of the larger brands in the market. 

&#160; 

Kombucha is the largest growth segment of the functional beverage category of drinks and foods, including coconut water, yogurt and fresh juices. Among this broader category, the refrigerated juices and functional beverages segment grew by approximately $200 million in 2012 to an estimated market of approximately $600 million (50% growth), according to SPINS data. Kombucha comprises the overwhelming majority share of this explosive growth and comprises most of the segment. It is generally believed that the segment will continue to expand at a strong rate over the next few years. Other functional drinks in this category are also expanding sales at healthy rates, primarily coconut water and fresh pressed juices. Consumer awareness and demand for functional drinks is increasing and we feel that Kombucha and other cultured drinks will be in the forefront of this expanding market category. 

&#160; 

We sell the majority of our products in the natural food store, mainstream supermarket chains and foodservice locations, primarily in the United States and, to a lesser degree, in Canada and Europe. 

&#160; 

Natural Food Stores 

&#160; 

Our primary and historical marketing and distribution source of our products has been natural food and gourmet stores throughout the US. These stores include Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe&#8217;s, Sprouts, The Fresh Market, Earth Fare, and New Seasons, just to name a few. Our brands are also sold in gourmet restaurants and deli&#8217;s nationwide. With the advent of large natural food store chains and specialty merchants, the natural foods segment continues to grow each year, helping fuel the continued growth of our brands. 

&#160; 

Mainstream Supermarkets and Retailers 

&#160; 

We also sell our products to direct store delivery distributors (DSD) who specialize in distributing and selling our products directly to mainstream retail channels, natural foods, and specialty retail stores. Our brands are further sold directly to some retailers who require that we sell directly to their distribution centers since they have developed their own logistics capabilities. Examples of chains that fall into the &#8220;direct&#8221; category are retailers such as, Costco, Trader Joe&#8217;s, some Whole Foods Market Regions and Kroger. 

&#160; 

Supermarkets, particularly supermarket chains and prominent local/regional chains, often impose slotting fees in order to gain shelf presence within their stores. These fees can be structured to be paid one-time only or in installments. We utilize selective slotting in supermarket chains throughout the US and to a lesser degree, in Canada. However, our local and national sales team has been able to place our products without having to pay significant slotting fees. Slotting fees for new item placements on average have cost anywhere between $10 to $150 per store, per new item. 

&#160; 

Food Service Placement 

&#160; 

We also market our beverages to industrial cafeterias (corporate feeders), and to on premise bars and restaurants. As our business continues to mature, we intend to place our beverages in stadiums, sport arenas, concert halls, theatres, and other cultural centers as long-term marketing and pouring relationships are developed within this business segment. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

International Sales 

&#160; 

We have developed a limited market for our products in Canada, Europe and Asia. Sales outside of North America currently represent less than 1% of our total sales. Sales in Canada represent about 1.3% of our total sales. We believe that there are good opportunities for expansion of sales in Canada and we are increasing our marketing focus on that market. Other international sales become cost prohibitive, except in specialty sales circumstances, since our premium sodas are packed in glass, which involves substantial freight to move overseas. We are open to opportunities to export and to co-pack internationally and expand our brands into foreign markets, and we are holding preliminary discussions with trading companies and import/export companies for the distribution of our products throughout Asia, Europe and South America. We believe that these areas are a natural fit for Reed&#8217;s ginger products, because of the importance of ginger in international markets, especially the Asian market where ginger is a significant part of diet and nutrition. 

&#160; 

Distribution, Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We currently have a national network of mainstream, natural and specialty food distributors in the United States and Canada. We sell directly to our distributors, who in turn sell to retail stores. We also use our own internal sales force and independent sales representatives to promote our products for our distributors and direct sales to our retail customers. One of the main goals of our sales and marketing efforts is to increase sales and grow our brands. Our sales force consists of senior sales representatives in five geographic regions across the country who are supported in their region by local Reeds sales staff. Generally, our sales managers are responsible for all activities related to the sales, distribution and marketing of our brands to our entire distributor and retail partner network in North America. We distribute our products primarily through several national natural foods distributors and an increasing number of regional mainstream DSD distributors. We have entered into agreements with some of our distributors that commit us to &#8220;termination fees&#8221; if we terminate our agreements early or without cause. These agreements call for our customer to have the right to distribute our products to a defined type of retailer within a defined geographic region. As is customary in the beverage industry, if we should terminate the agreement or not automatically renew the agreement, we would be obligated to make certain payments to our customers. We are in constant review of our distribution agreement with our partners across North America. We also offer our products and promotional merchandise directly to consumers via the Internet through our website, www.reedsgingerbrew.com. 

&#160; 

Marketing to Distributors 

&#160; 

We market to distributors using a number of marketing strategies, including direct solicitation, telemarketing, trade advertising and trade show exhibition. These distributors include natural food, gourmet food and mainstream distributors. Our distributors sell our products directly to natural food, gourmet food and mainstream supermarkets for sale to the public. We maintain direct contact with our distributor partners through our in-house sales managers. From time to time and in very limited markets, when use of our own sales force is not cost effective, we will utilize independent sales brokers and outside representatives. 

&#160; 

Marketing to Retail Stores 

&#160; 

The primary focus of our sales efforts is supermarket sales. We have a small highly trained sales force that is directly contacting supermarket chains and setting up promotional calendars. In addition, we market to retail stores by utilizing trade shows, trade advertising, telemarketing, direct mail pieces and direct contact with the store. Our sales managers and representatives visit these retail stores to sell directly in many regions. Sales to retail stores are coordinated through our distribution network and our regional warehouses. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other branding campaigns. In addition, the company&#8217;s manufacturing these products generally have greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. We also compete for distributors who will concentrate on marketing our products over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the soft drink category could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion. We believe that our all natural innovative beverage recipes, packaging, use of premium ingredients and a trade secret brewing process provide us with a competitive advantage and that our commitments to the highest quality standards and brand innovation are keys to our success. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Kombucha market is dominated by a few producers who sell their products nationally. The remainder of the producers is comprised of mostly fragmented regional or local companies. There are companies that gain market share in certain regions; however, most do not have the scale and capability to effectively sell and distribute on a national basis. We believe that Reed&#8217;s Kombucha market share was achieved in a relatively short period of time, by leveraging our existing distribution channels and customer relationships to expand our sales volume quickly. We also have in-house production capabilities that can be scaled up as needed to make this a primary brand for Reed&#8217;s. We believe that our existing infrastructure creates a competitive advantage, including product design, manufacturing &#38; production and a network of sales &#38; distribution. 

&#160; 

Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

We own trademarks that we consider material to our business. Three of our material trademarks are registered trademarks in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office: Reed&#8217;s Original Ginger Brew All-Natural Jamaican Style Ginger Ale &#174;, Virgil&#8217;s &#174;, and China Cola &#174;. Registrations for trademarks in the United States will last indefinitely as long as we continue to use and police the trademarks and renew filings with the applicable governmental offices. We have not been challenged in our right to use any of our material trademarks in the United States. We intend to obtain international registration of certain trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

In addition, we consider our finished product and concentrate formulae, which are not the subject of any patents, to be trade secrets. Our brewing process is a trade secret. This process can be used to brew flavors of beverages other than ginger ale and ginger beer, such as root beer, cream soda, cola and other spice and fruit beverages. We have not sought any patents on our brewing processes because we would be required to disclose our brewing process in patent applications. 

&#160; 

We generally use non-disclosure agreements with employees and distributors to protect our proprietary rights. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our Company&#8217;s products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

A California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. This is because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally or that are contributed to such products solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. No Company beverages produced for sale in California are currently required to display warnings under this law. We are unable to predict whether a component found in a Company product might be added to the California list in the future, although the state has initiated a regulatory process in which caffeine will be evaluated for listing. Furthermore, we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology that may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended, might result in the detection of an infinitesimal quantity of a listed substance in a beverage of ours produced for sale in California.

Bottlers of our beverage products presently offer and use non-refillable, recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around the world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring that deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit, recycling, tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.

All of our facilities and other operations in the United States are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Our primary cost environmental compliance activity is in recycling fees and redemption values. We are required to collect redemption values from our customers and remit those redemption values to the state, based upon the number of bottles of certain products sold in that state.

Employees 

&#160; 

We have 36 full-time employees on our corporate staff, as follows: 4 in general management, 4 in manufacturing, research and development, 17 in sales and marketing support, and 11 in accounting, administration and operations. We also have approximately 40 production employees that work both full and part time and work flexible hours based on volume demands. We employ additional people on a part-time basis as needed. We have never participated in a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that the relationship with our employees is good.
