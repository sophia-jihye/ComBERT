 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

Intellinetics, Inc., formerly known as GlobalWise Investments, Inc. (&#8220;Intellinetics&#8221;), is a Nevada holding company incorporated in 1997, with a single operating subsidiary, Intellinetics, Inc., an Ohio corporation (&#8220;Intellinetics Ohio,&#8221; together with Intellinetics, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;). Intellinetics Ohio was incorporated in 1996, and on February 10, 2012, Intellinetics Ohio became the sole operating subsidiary of Intellinetics as a result of a reverse merger and recapitalization.

&#160;

The Company is an enterprise content management (&#8220;ECM&#8221;) software development, sales and marketing company serving both the public and private sectors. In the public sector, the Company&#8217;s products, services and process models serve, principally, the critical needs of law enforcement and compliance agencies within the state and local government establishment. The Company provides its software solutions principally through (i) the direct licensing of its software installed on customer computer platforms and (ii) providing the applications as a service, accessible through the internet. The Company&#8217;s comprehensive solutions include services that range from pre-installation assessment, project scoping, implementation, consulting and ongoing software maintenance and customer support. In time, the Company anticipates that the provision of &#8220;cloud&#8221; application services, or software as a service, will become a more significant part of its software sales business.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s software products allow customers to manage &#8220;enterprise content&#8221; (unstructured data such as hard-copy scanned documents, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, JPEG files, images, pictures, faxes, audio/video files, emails, and PowerPoint presentations) through its entire life cycle. The Company&#8217;s platform, Intellivue&#8482;, specializes in improving and enhancing business operations for clients by making document and content management simple, accessible and affordable. The Company offers industry-specific vertical &#8220;composite content applications&#8221; (&#8220;CCA&#8221;) to clients in a pre-configured, on-demand basis through the &#8220;On-demand Solution Store&#8482;.&#8221; This approach to deploying templates for specific business processes empowers clients to affordably manage their complete document life cycle inherently within the turnkey Intellivue TM platform.

Software and Services 

&#160; 

Our flagship platform, Intellivue TM , makes the economic and operational benefits of ECM readily available to underserved small to medium sized businesses, who in the past could not afford the turnkey platforms available only from providers such as International Business Machines Corporation (&#8220;IBM&#8221;) or EMC Corporation. Intellinetics is the only ECM provider in the market that offers the six core components of ECM inherently within a single price as part of its core go-to-market strategy. The single-price strategy makes cost of ownership simple to understand as support for a buying decision and distinguishes our marketing strategy from that of most ECM providers.

&#160;

The six components of Intellivue TM are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; Image-processing Application: The Intellivue TM platform includes image processing modules used for capturing, transforming and managing images of paper documents. Intellivue TM supports distributed and high volume capture, optical and intelligent character recognition, and form-processing technology. Intellivue TM open architecture enables plug-and-play compatibility with industry-leading advanced capture tools from providers such as Ancora; &#160;

&#183; Records Management: The Intellivue TM records management module is designed to address needs relating to long-term retention of content through automation and policies, ensuring legal, regulatory and industry compliance for our clients; &#160;

&#183; Workflow/BPM: Intellivue TM is designed to support business processes, routing content electronically, assigning work tasks and states (e.g., reviews or approvals), and creating related audit trails; &#160;

&#183; Social Content: Intellivue TM addresses document sharing, collaboration and knowledge management, and project teams. Specifically, video files are the fastest-growing category of new content in this defined area. Previously referred to as &#8220;document collaboration,&#8221; social content reflects a broader audience and a range of content types; &#160;

&#183; Web Content Management: The Intellivue TM platform specifically addresses native functions such as templating, workflow, change management, and content deployment functions that deliver prepackaged or on-demand content (via Intellivue TM WebVue&#8482;). A key strength in this area is the ability of Intellivue TM to use our full-functioned web services based on our Software Development Kit (SDK) and Application Protocol Interface (API); and &#160;

&#183; Extended Components: Intellivue TM includes document composition and e-forms (via third party OEM integration partnership), search, content and web analytics (via third party Advanced OCR engine partnership), email and information archiving and packaged application integration (via Intellinetics&#8217; DirectVue&#8482;). &#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Historically, our marketing efforts focused on generating sales leads primarily through the use of a direct sales force, limited channel partnerships, and trade shows. To a lesser extent, we use our website featuring solution overviews, case studies, white papers, and customer testimonials. Around the beginning of 2014, we decided to dynamically change our traditional direct sales approach.

&#160;

At that time, we reviewed what we had learned from our limited channel relationships with such companies as Lexmark International, Inc., Tiburon, and ACS Wagers and began a focused sales transformation. We reduced our direct sales force and changed our sales strategy to focus our sales efforts toward a much greater percentage of sales through intermediaries, such as software resellers and multi-function device resellers, rather than through direct sales. We developed marketing programs with resellers that facilitate their selling and support of our software solutions. We refer to these resellers as our &#8220;channel partners.&#8221; For purposes of this section, a &#8220;channel partner&#8221; is a company that we partner with to market and sell our products and technologies.

&#160;

These refinements in our marketing strategy have led to a substantial increase in new customers. As a result, we are now committed to offering a best-in-class channel partner program serving mid-market customers in both the public and private sectors. In 2015, we placed increased effort on building the support infrastructure required to compete more efficiently using a channel partner strategy. Through these efforts we now have expanded to fourteen reselling partners across the entire United States, which partners we believe are positioned to yield financial growth in 2016.

&#160;

The historic sales cycle for ECM products has been long (i.e., 18-24 months) when compared to that of most ECM vendors. We believe the combination of our open-source platform and &#8216;on-demand&#8217; solution templates delivered as a packaged Cloud platform sold through a select distribution channel with simple inclusive pricing models will help us realize a much shorter sales cycle, ranging from 30 to 120 days. We believe this sales cycle contraction will set a new benchmark within the ECM industry for time-to-value from an end-user perspective while supporting an efficient increase in net new subscribers.

&#160;

Competition and Market Position 

&#160; 

The market for our products is highly competitive, and we expect that competition will continue to intensify as the ECM markets consolidate. We believe our primary competitors in our market, the small-to-medium business sector, are DocuWare, Square 9, and Laserfiche. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for our software products and services include: (i) vendor and product reputation; (ii) product quality, performance and price; (iii) the availability of software products on multiple platforms; (iv) product scalability; (v) product integration with other enterprise applications; (vi) software functionality and features; (vii) software ease of use; (viii) the quality of professional services, customer support services and training, and (ix) the ability to address specific customer business problems. We believe that the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.

&#160;

For the small-to-medium market, computer industry leaders such as Microsoft, IBM, EMC Corporation, Open Text, and Oracle all face the same problem: they either cannot scale bi-directionally (i.e. cannot scale down, and have no lower price point for offerings), or are proprietary in nature and do not integrate well with others. Therefore, these leaders are caught in a price-point dilemma and are facing major decreases in market share. Due to their operating overhead, these vendors&#8217; easiest path into the small-to-medium business sector or enterprise augmentation (&#8216;departmental play&#8217;) is through acquiring a smaller ECM vendor such as Intellinetics. Alternatively, these vendors may simply avoid such opportunities, leaving an evergreen field of opportunities for Intellinetics.

&#160;

We believe that Intellinetics has advantages over our competitors in the small-to-medium market. In our view, Intellinetics will remain competitive by remaining a focused niche provider with product offerings aligned with buyer-specific requirements. We anticipate that Intellinetics will benefit from four specific advantages already in place:

&#160;

&#183; Turnkey cloud or premise document workflow solutions targeting SMB buyers with benchmark value-to-price ratio; &#160;

&#183; Intel-enabled solution packaging and customer activation model; &#160;

&#183; Industry-first integrated on-demand solutions library as standard platform feature; and &#160;

&#183; Proprietary AuditShield compliance management module as a standard platform feature providing SMB buyers, for the first time, with a simple way to know if documents required by law or policy are missing. &#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe, with these competitive strengths, that Intellinetics is well positioned as a niche ECM provider for the small-to-medium business sector offering a complete world of ECM on one single turnkey platform &#8211; Intellivue&#8482;, requiring no modular pricing, enabling our clients to assemble, protect, find, collaborate on and ultimately use their content more effectively. Intellivue TM can provide a complete set of industry-unique CCA solutions (also known as &#8220;on-demand&#8221; solution templates), accelerated by cloud delivery, that have been previously unavailable to the markets we serve.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

Revenues from the Company&#8217;s services to a limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial percentage of the Company&#8217;s total revenues. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s two largest customers, Tiburon, Inc. (&#8220;Tiburon&#8221;) a reseller and Washington State Patrol (&#8220;WSP&#8221;) a direct end user, accounted for approximately 10% and 5%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s revenues for that period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the Company&#8217;s two largest customers, Tiburon, Inc. (&#8220;Tiburon&#8221;) a reseller and CareWorks (&#8220;CareWorks&#8221;) a direct end user, accounted for approximately 12% and 5%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s revenues for that period.

&#160;

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, government contracts represented approximately 42% and 50% of the Company&#8217;s net revenues, respectively. A significant portion of the Company&#8217;s sales to resellers&#8217; represent ultimate sales to government agencies. Due to their dependence on state, local and federal budgets, government contracts carry short terms, typically less than 18 months. Since our inception, our contracts with government customers have generally renewed on the original terms and conditions upon expiration. A significant portion of our sales to resellers represent ultimate sales to government agencies.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our software and most of the underlying technologies are built on a Microsoft.Net framework. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary intellectual property rights.

&#160;

Customers license the right to use our software products on a non-exclusive basis. We grant to third parties rights in our intellectual property that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product or to a particular geographic area.

&#160;

While we believe that our intellectual property as a whole is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our business. Other than government procurement rules affecting sales to governmental customers, we do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations or approval requirements affecting our products or services. Complying with the regulations and requirements applicable to our business does not entail a significant cost or burden. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We design, develop, test, market, license, and support new software products and enhancements of current products. Recent examples of significant trends in the software industry include cloud computing, mobility, social media, and software as a service. We continuously monitor our software products and enhancements to remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. We expense as incurred, our software development costs. For the twelve months ending December 31, 2015 and 2014, our research and development costs were $497,976 and $407,716, respectively.

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 25, 2016, we employed a total of 20 individuals; all but one are full-time employees. We believe that relations with our employees are good. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we do not have collective bargaining arrangements with any of our employees.
