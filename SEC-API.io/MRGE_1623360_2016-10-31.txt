Business Development 

&#160;

Bridgewater Platforms Inc. (&#8220;Bridgewater Platforms&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 6, 2014. Bridgewater Platforms Inc., incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in the Province of Ontario, Canada on May 20, 2014, called Bridgewater Construction Ltd. The company&#8217;s address is 78 Shorncliffe Road, Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada M8Z 5K5. Our telephone number is 416-659-8907.

&#160;

Bridgewater Platforms' wholly owned subsidiary, Bridgewater Construction Ltd. operates as a landscape design and construction services business. The Company currently offers landscaping and minor construction services and intends to expand its business and to develop a new outdoor pool covering product and service that will help northern cold-climate homeowners solve the dilemma of what to do with their pools over the fall, winter, and spring months when pool use is not possible.

&#160;

During the year ended July 31, 2016, we generated $28,560 in revenue from landscaping construction projects. In addition to nominal revenues, we have relied upon the sale of our securities to investors and corporate officers and directors for funding. 

&#160;

Principal Products, Services and Their Markets 

&#160;

Bridgewater Platforms Inc., through its wholly-owned Canada-based subsidiary Bridgewater Construction Inc., plans to develop a product and service that will help northern cold-climate homeowners solve the dilemma of what to do with their pools over the fall, winter, and spring months when pool use is not possible. Currently, homeowners use makeshift covers of various materials or resort to installing more elaborate systems that involve drilling anchors or other hardware into the cement or stone pool deck. These solutions can provide some degree of protection from debris entering the pool; however, they are not a secure solution to preventing animals, children, or other unwanted objects from the dangers of unsecured water. Additionally, these systems fail to address another core concern for homeowners in Northern climates: extensive garden space taken up by the pool itself is often rendered useless for 6-8 months of the year from fall to spring when swimming is not possible. Bridgewater Platforms presents an innovative solution that will solve concerns that relate to issues of maintenance, safety, and functional utilization of backyard space.

&#160; &#160; 3 

&#160;

When the Company conducted its market research it found demand for other backyard services such as landscape design and construction. Given that the pool covering system is still under development, the company has expanded its services to include landscape design and construction. Hence, commencing in October 2014, the Company began generating revenue from these services.

&#160;

Distribution Methods 

&#160;

Potential customers will find our landscape design and construction and pool bridging systems via a marketing campaign that will leverage the internet and select industry publications. The initial test market will be in the cold weather market of Toronto, Canada.

&#160;

Status of Publicly Announced New Products or Services 

&#160;

Bridgewater Platforms has no new publicly announced products or services.

&#160;

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Bridgewater Platforms' Position in the Industry 

&#160;

There are a number of different landscape design and construction and pool covering businesses in the marketplace, however, they primarily offer a soft cover solution that sees anchors drilled into pool decks to support an elasticized cover that is stretched over the pool in winter. These covers can be walked on in emergencies, but it is generally not recommended as a standard practice. There are also cases where the structural integrity of these soft cover systems commonly fails even with simple dead loads of rain and snow. In addition, while these covers do provide a measure of coverage, the space is still rendered unusable for the period that the cover is installed.

&#160;

Bridgewater Platforms plans to enter the marketplace with a solution that provides a higher degree of safety and at the same time enables the previously unusable space to be walked-on for social gatherings as required on a day-to-day basis and at little to no effort on the part of the customer. The covers will be engineered to meet safety requirements for live and dead loads. And all the customer will have to do is call to request the installation and removal dates. The Company also plans to be able to provide this service outside of the traditional spring removal and fall installation periods, for customers that may wish to hold a special back yard event. The Company will arrive the day before the event to install the platform, and remove it the day after. These special requests would be outside of the normal seasonal service and would be subject to extra charges.

&#160;

Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers 

&#160;

Bridgewater Platforms is leveraging the experience of its President, Emanuel Oliveira. Mr. Oliveira owns an existing and established Toronto soft and hard landscaping company, working on projects the size of which range from weeks to years in Canada's largest market. Mr. Oliveira has recognized the need for a more substantial pool covering system in cold-weather cities. Mr. Oliveira has agreed to dedicate part of his workshop and storage space to the Company for this start-up phase.

&#160;

As we continue to grow we will seek the services of new qualified staff members or outside contractors.

Plan of Operation 

&#160;

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Except for the historical information contained herein, the discussion in this report contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Form 10-K should be read as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Form 10-K. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.

&#160;

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay for our expenses. This is because we have generated limited revenues and have limited operating history. There is no assurance we will ever reach this point. Accordingly, we must raise sufficient capital from sources. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others. We must raise cash to stay in business. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings. 

&#160; &#160; 5 

&#160;

Bridgewater Platforms has limited operations, limited revenue, limited financial backing and limited assets. Our plan is to continue operate and expand our landscape design and minor construction services business and intends to expand its business and develop a new outdoor pool covering product and service that will help northern cold-climate homeowners solve the dilemma of what to do with their pools over the fall, winter, and spring months when pool use is not possible.

&#160;

We are a public entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements. 

At present, we do not have enough cash on hand to cover our anticipated regulatory reporting costs for the next 12 months. In order to proceed with our business plan, we will have to find alternative sources of funds, like a second public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from our officers or third parties (such as banks or other institutional lenders). Equity financing could result in additional dilution to then existing shareholders. If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either money that we raise from our equity, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue to maintain, develop or expand our operations.
