 Item 1. 

BUSINESS 

Raymond James Financial, Inc. (&#8220;RJF&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a financial holding company whose broker-dealer subsidiaries are engaged in various financial services businesses, including the underwriting, distribution, trading and brokerage of equity and debt securities and the sale of mutual funds and other investment products. In addition, other subsidiaries of RJF provide investment management services for retail and institutional clients, corporate and retail banking, and trust services. 

Established in 1962 and public since 1983, RJF has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;) since 1986 under the symbol &#8220;RJF.&#8221; As a financial holding company, RJF is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Fed&#8221;). 

RJF&#8217;s principal subsidiaries are Raymond James &#38; Associates, Inc. (&#8220;RJ&#38;A&#8221;), Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (&#8220;RJFS&#8221;), Raymond James Financial Services Advisors, Inc. (&#8220;RJFSA&#8221;), Raymond James Ltd. (&#8220;RJ Ltd.&#8221;), Eagle Asset Management, Inc. (&#8220;Eagle&#8221;), and Raymond James Bank, N.A. (&#8220;RJ Bank&#8221;). All of these subsidiaries are wholly owned by RJF. RJF and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; or &#8220;us.&#8221; Our operations are predominately conducted in the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and Canada. 

Among the keys to our historical and continued success, our emphasis on putting the client first is at the core of our corporate values. We also believe in maintaining a conservative, long-term focus in our decision making. We believe that this disciplined decision-making approach translates to a strong, stable financial services firm for clients, advisors, associates and shareholders. 

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 

We currently operate through four operating segments and our &#8220;Other&#8221; segment. The four operating segments are &#8220;Private Client Group&#8221; (&#8220;PCG&#8221;), &#8220;Capital Markets,&#8221; &#8220;Asset Management,&#8221; and RJ Bank. The Other segment captures principal capital and private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF. 

The graph below depicts the relative net revenue contribution of each of our operating segments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016: 

*Chart above does not include intersegment eliminations or the Other segment. 

PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP 

We provide financial planning and securities transaction services to more than 2.9 million client accounts through the branch office systems of RJ&#38;A, RJFS, RJFSA, RJ Ltd. and in the United Kingdom through Raymond James Investment Services Limited (&#8220;RJIS&#8221;). Financial advisors have multiple affiliation options, which we refer to as AdvisorChoice. Our two primary affiliation options for financial advisors are the employee option and the independent contractor option. 

We recruit experienced financial advisors from a wide variety of competitors. As a part of their agreement to join us, we may make loans to financial advisors and to certain key revenue producers, primarily for transitional cost assistance and retention purposes. 

Total assets under administration in the PCG segment as of September 30, 2016 &#32;amount to $574.1 billion . We have 7,146 &#32;financial advisors affiliated with us as of September 30, 2016 . 

Employee Financial Advisors 

Employee financial advisors work in a traditional branch setting supported by local management and administrative staff. They provide services predominately to individual clients. These financial advisors are our employees, and their compensation primarily includes commission payments and participation in the firm&#8217;s benefit plans. 

Independent Contractor Financial Advisors 

Our financial advisors who are independent contractors are responsible for all of their direct costs and, accordingly, are paid a larger percentage of commissions and fees than employee financial advisors. Our independent contractor financial advisor option is designed to help our advisors build their businesses with as much or as little of our support as they determine they need. With specific approval, they are permitted to conduct, on a limited basis, certain other approved business activities, such as offering insurance products, independent registered investment advisory services, and accounting and tax services. 

Irrespective of the affiliation choice, our financial advisors offer a broad range of investments and services, including both third party and proprietary products, and a variety of financial planning services. Revenues from this segment are typically driven by total client assets under administration, and are generally either recurring fee-based or transactional in nature. The proportion of our securities commissions and fee revenues originating from the employee versus the independent contractor affiliation models is relatively balanced. 

Securities commissions and fee revenues by affiliation, as well as the portion of total segment revenues that is recurring versus transactional in nature, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 , are presented below: 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

We provide the following types of services through this segment: 

&#8226; 

We provide investment services for which we charge sales commissions or asset-based fees based on established schedules. 

&#8226; 

We offer investment advisory services. Fee revenues for such services are computed as either a percentage of the assets in the client account or a flat periodic fee charged to the client for investment advice. 

&#8226; 

Our U.S. financial advisors provide insurance and annuity products through our general insurance agency, Raymond James Insurance Group, Inc. 

&#8226; 

Our U.S. financial advisors offer a number of professionally managed load and no-load mutual funds. 

&#8226; 

We provide margin loans to clients that are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client. Interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed based on current interest rates. 

&#8226; 

We provide custodial, trading, research and other back office support and services (including access to clients&#8217; account information and the services of the Asset Management segment) to the independent contractor registered investment advisors with whom we are affiliated. 

&#8226; 

We conduct securities lending activities through RJ&#38;A, in which we borrow and lend securities from and to broker-dealers, financial institutions, and other counterparties. Generally, we conduct these activities as an intermediary (referred to as &#8220;matched book&#8221;). However, RJ&#38;A will also loan client marginable securities in a margin account containing a debit (referred to as lending from the &#8220;box&#8221;) to counterparties. The borrower of the securities puts up a cash deposit on which interest is earned. The lender in turn receives cash and pays interest. The net revenues of this business consist of the interest spreads generated on these activities. 

&#8226; 

Through our Alternative Investments Group, we provide diversification strategies and products to qualified clients of our affiliated financial advisors. The Alternative Investments Group provides strategies and products for portfolio investment allocation opportunities where a selective addition of alternative investments that have historically demonstrated lower correlation to traditional market indices may reduce overall portfolio volatility and increase long-term performance. 

&#8226; 

Through the formation of the Alex. Brown division of RJ&#38;A, we enhanced our capabilities to service the needs of ultra-high-net-worth clients and select institutions. 

. 

CAPITAL MARKETS 

Our capital markets segment conducts institutional sales, securities trading, equity research, investment banking, syndicate, and the syndication of investments that qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (referred to as our &#8220;tax credit funds&#8221;). Within our management structure, we distinguish between activities that support equity and fixed income products and services. We primarily conduct these activities in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. 

The graph below depicts the portions of this segment&#8217;s revenues that are derived from equity securities and products, fixed income securities and products, and our tax credit funds activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016: 

We provide the following services through this segment: 

Equity Capital Markets Activities 

&#8226; 

We earn institutional sales commissions on the sale of equity products. Sales volume is influenced by a combination of general market activity and the Capital Markets group&#8217;s ability to identify and promote attractive investment opportunities for our institutional clients. Commission amounts on equity transactions are based on trade size and the amount of business conducted annually with each institution. 

&#8226; 

We provide various investment banking services including public and private equity financing for corporate clients and merger and acquisition advisory services. Our investment banking activities include a comprehensive range of strategic and financial advisory services tailored to our clients&#8217; business life cycles and backed by our strategic industry focus. 

&#8226; 

In our syndicate operations, we coordinate the marketing, distribution, pricing and stabilization of lead and co-managed equity underwritings. In addition to lead and co-managed offerings, this department coordinates our participation in transactions managed by other investment banking firms. 

&#8226; 

Our domestic research department supports our institutional and retail sales efforts and publishes research on a wide variety of companies. This research primarily focuses on U.S. and Canadian companies in specific industries, including agricultural, consumer, energy, clean energy, energy services, financial services, healthcare, industrial, mining and natural resources, forest products, real estate, technology, and communication and transportation. Proprietary industry studies and company-specific research reports are made available to both institutional and individual clients. 

Fixed Income Activities 

&#8226; 

We earn institutional sales commissions from institutional clients who purchase both taxable and tax-exempt fixed income products, primarily municipal, corporate, government agency and mortgage-backed bonds. The commissions that we charge on fixed income products are based on trade size and the characteristics of the specific security involved. 

&#8226; 

We carry inventories of taxable and tax-exempt securities to facilitate institutional sales activities. Our taxable and tax-exempt fixed income traders purchase and sell corporate, municipal, government, government agency, and mortgage-backed bonds, asset-backed securities, preferred stock, and certificates of deposit from and to our clients or other dealers. 

&#8226; 

Our fixed income investment banking services include public finance and debt underwriting activities where we serve as a financial advisor, placement agent or underwriter to various issuers, including state and local government agencies (and their political subdivisions), housing agencies, and non-profit entities including health care and higher education institutions. We may also act as a consultant, underwriter, or selling group member for offerings of corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), whole loans, agency bonds, preferred stock and unit investment trusts. When underwriting new issue securities, we may agree to purchase the issue through a negotiated sale or submission of a competitive bid. 

&#8226; 

In order to facilitate client transactions, hedge a portion of our fixed income securities inventories, or to a limited extent for our own account, we enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts. In addition, we conduct a &#8220;matched book&#8221; derivatives business where we may enter into derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, options, and combinations of those instruments, primarily with government entities and not-for-profit counterparties. In this matched book business, for every derivative transaction we enter into with a client, we enter into an offsetting derivative transaction with a credit support provider that is a third party financial institution. 

&#8226; 

Through our fixed income public finance operations, we enter into forward commitments to purchase Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221;) or Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;FNMA&#8221;) MBS. Such MBS securities are issued on behalf of various state and local housing finance agencies (&#8220;HFA&#8221;) clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs. 

Tax Credit Fund Activities 

&#8226; 

In our syndication of tax credit investments, one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner or managing member in partnerships and limited liability companies that invest in real estate project entities which qualify for tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. We earn fees for the origination and sale of these investment products as well as for the oversight and management of the investments over the statutory tax credit compliance period. 

ASSET MANAGEMENT 

Our Asset Management segment provides investment advisory and asset management services to individual and institutional investment portfolios, and sponsors mutual funds under the name &#8220;Eagle&#8221; (&#8220;Eagle Funds&#8221;). We also provide services to our PCG clients (&#8220;AMS&#8221;) and through Raymond James Trust, N.A. (&#8220;RJ Trust&#8221;). 

&#32;We earn advisory fees on both managed and non-discretionary asset-based accounts. In managed programs, we make decisions about how to invest the assets in accordance with such programs objectives. In non-discretionary asset-based programs, we provide administrative support to each plan, which may include trade execution, record-keeping and periodic investor reporting. We generally earn higher fees for managed programs than for non-discretionary asset-based programs, since we provide additional services to managed programs. As of September 30, 2016 , there were $77.0 billion &#32;in financial assets held in managed programs and $119.3 billion &#32;in financial assets held in non-discretionary asset-based programs. 

The graph below depicts financial assets under management in our managed programs by objective as of September 30, 2016: 

RJ BANK 

RJ Bank provides corporate loans, securities based loans (&#8220;SBL&#8221;) and residential loans. RJ Bank is active in corporate loan syndications and participations. RJ Bank also provides Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) insured deposit accounts to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public. RJ Bank generates net interest revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings. 

RJ Bank operates primarily from a branch location adjacent to RJF&#8217;s corporate office complex in St. Petersburg, Florida. Access to RJ Bank&#8217;s products and services is available nationwide through the offices of our affiliated broker-dealers as well as through electronic banking services. RJ Bank&#8217;s assets include commercial and industrial (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, tax-exempt loans, as well as loans fully collateralized by marketable securities. Corporate loans represent approximately 70% of RJ Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio, of which 95% are U.S. and Canadian syndicated loans. Residential mortgage loans are originated or purchased and held for investment or sold in the secondary market. RJ Bank&#8217;s liabilities primarily consist of deposits that are cash balances swept from the investment accounts of PCG clients. 

RJ Bank has total assets of $16.6 billion &#32;at September 30, 2016 , which are comprised of the following: 

OTHER 

Our &#8220;Other&#8221; segment includes our principal capital and private equity activities as well as certain corporate overhead costs of RJF, such as the interest cost on our senior notes payable, and the acquisition and integration costs associated with certain acquisitions (See Note 3 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on our acquisitions). 

Our principal capital and private equity activities include various direct and third party private equity investments; employee investment funds (the &#8220;Employee Funds&#8221;); and various private equity funds which we sponsor. 

EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS 

Our employees and independent contractors (collectively &#8220;associates&#8221;) are vital to our success in the financial services industry. As of September 30, 2016 , we had over 11,900 employees, and over 4,000 affiliated independent contractor financial advisors. 

OPERATIONS AND INFORMATION PROCESSING 

We have operations personnel at various locations throughout the U.S. who are responsible for processing securities transactions, custody of client securities, support of client accounts, the receipt, identification and delivery of funds and securities, and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements for most of our U.S. securities brokerage operations. RJ Ltd. operations personnel have similar responsibilities at our Canadian brokerage operations located in Vancouver, British Columbia. 

The information technology department develops and supports the integrated solutions that provide a differentiated platform for our business. This platform is designed to allow our financial advisors to spend more time with their clients and enhance and grow their business. 

In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients. We apply numerous safeguards to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of both client and Company information. 

Our business continuity program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance that we will continue to operate in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities. Our business departments have developed operational plans for such disruptions, and we have a staff which devotes its full time to monitoring and facilitating those plans. Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous operations in the event of weather-related or other interruptions at our corporate headquarters in Florida or one of our operations processing or data center sites in Florida, Colorado, Tennessee or Michigan. 

We have also developed a business continuity plan for each of our PCG retail branches in the event any of these branches is impacted by severe weather. 

COMPETITION 

The financial services industry is an intensely competitive business. We compete with many other financial services firms, including a number of larger securities firms, most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies, insurance companies, banking institutions and other organizations. We also compete with companies that offer web-based financial services and discount brokerage services, usually with lower levels of service, to individual clients. We compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates, services, product selection, location and reputation in local markets. 

Our ability to compete effectively in these businesses is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified associates, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel. 

REGULATION 

RJF is a bank holding company subject to the Bank Holding Company Act that has made an election to be a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, RJF is subject to regulation, oversight, and supervision, including periodic examination, by the Fed. RJ Bank is a national bank regulated, supervised and examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). Our trust company subsidiary also is regulated, supervised and examined by the OCC. The Fed and the FDIC also regulate and may examine RJ Bank and the trust company. Collectively, the rules and regulations of the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC and the CFPB cover all aspects of the banking business, including, for example, lending practices, the receipt of deposits, capital structure, transactions with affiliates, conduct and qualifications of personnel, and as discussed further below, capital requirements. This regulatory and supervisory framework is currently subject to significant changes that can affect the operating costs and permissible businesses of RJF, RJ Bank and the trust company. As a part of their supervisory function, the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB also have the power to bring enforcement actions for violations of law and, in the case of the Fed, the OCC and the FDIC, unsafe or unsound practices. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries, which also are registered investment advisors, are subject to regulation and oversight by various regulatory and self-regulatory authorities discussed under &#8220;Other regulations applicable to our operations&#8221; below. 

The following discussion summarizes briefly the principal elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to RJF. The framework is intended to protect our clients and customers, the integrity of the financial markets, and our depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and is not intended to protect our creditors or shareholders. These rules and regulations limit our ability to engage in certain activities, as well as our ability to upstream to RJF funds from our regulated subsidiaries, which include RJ Bank or our broker-dealer subsidiaries. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and 

regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our business. 

Rules and regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act 

In July 2010, the U.S. government enacted sweeping changes to the supervision and regulation of the financial industry through the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rulemakings, studies and reports. These regulatory agencies include: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;); the Fed; the OCC; the FDIC; the CFPB; and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately; however, the details of some provisions are subject to implementing regulations. Furthermore, some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are still subject to further rulemaking proceedings and studies and will take effect over the next several years. 

As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and other regulatory reforms, we are experiencing a period of unprecedented change in financial regulation and supervision. These changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct our business. Many regulatory or supervisory policies remain in a state of flux. As a result, we cannot specifically quantify the impact that such regulatory or supervisory requirements will have on our business and operations (see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations). Below, we highlight certain of the more significant changes brought about as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

FDIC Assessment Rates 

Since RJ Bank provides deposits covered by FDIC insurance, generally up to $250,000 per account ownership type, RJ Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. In February 2011, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC issued a final rule changing its assessment base. For banks with greater than $10 billion in assets, the FDIC&#8217;s new rule changed the assessment rate calculation, which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the FDIC&#8217;s exposure should the bank fail. This new rule became effective for RJ Bank beginning with the December 2013 assessment period. 

CFPB Oversight 

In July 2011, the CFPB began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and was provided broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has supervisory and enforcement powers under several consumer protection laws, including the: (i) Equal Credit Opportunity Act; (ii) Truth in Lending Act; (iii) Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; (iv) Fair Credit Reporting Act; (v) Fair Debt Collection Act; (vi) Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under section 1031 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Beginning with fiscal year 2014, the CFPB assumed supervisory authority over RJ Bank for its compliance with the various federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has authority to promulgate regulations, issue orders, draft policy statements, conduct examinations, and bring enforcement actions. The creation of the CFPB has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws. To the extent that, as a result of such heightened scrutiny and oversight, we become the subject of any enforcement activity, we may be required to pay fines, incur penalties, or engage in certain remediation efforts. 

Stress Tests 

In October 2012, the Fed, FDIC and OCC jointly issued final rules requiring certain bank holding companies, state member banks, and savings and loan companies with total assets between $10 billion and $50 billion to conduct annual company-prepared stress tests, report the results to their primary regulator and the Fed (who is RJF&#8217;s primary regulator), and publish a summary of the results. Stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios (baseline, adverse, and severely adverse) prescribed by the Fed. RJF was required to conduct its first stress test by March 2014. The Dodd-Frank Act also required that RJF begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress test results no later than June 30, 2015 for the stress test cycle beginning on October 1, 2014. The summary of certain stress test results is available on our website under &#8220;More... - Investors - Financial Reports - Other Reports and Information - 2016 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test Disclosure&#8221; (the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report). 

The Volcker Rule 

RJF is subject to the Volcker Rule, which generally prohibits, subject to exceptions, insured depository institutions, bank holding companies and their affiliates (together, &#8220;Banking Entities&#8221;) from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading&#8221; or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund (&#8220;covered funds&#8221;). Banking Entities engaged in proprietary trading and/or investments in covered funds must establish a Volcker Rule-specific compliance program. We have adopted a program, which is designed to be effective in ensuring compliance with the Volcker Rule, however, in connection with their examinations, regulators will assess the sufficiency and adequacy of our program. The Volcker Rule also limits investments in, and relationships with, covered funds. The conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in certain illiquid funds has been extended and Banking Entities may still apply for an additional five-year extension with respect to investments in certain illiquid funds. We maintain a number of private equity investments, some of which meet the definition of covered funds under the Volcker Rule. The extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to realize the value of these investments in due course and implement any additional actions necessary for conformance with the rule. To the extent that any of our covered funds satisfy the Fed&#8217;s criteria for further extension for certain illiquid funds, we may apply for such extensions, although there is no assurance that any such extension would be granted. 

Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules 

Both RJF, as a bank holding company, and RJ Bank are subject to capital requirements that have increased due to recent regulatory actions. In July 2013, the OCC, the Fed and the FDIC released final U.S. rules implementing the Basel III capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions and updated the prompt corrective action framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums (the &#8220;U.S. Basel III Rules&#8221;). The U.S. Basel III Rules: (i) increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital; (ii) establish a capital conservation buffer; and (iii) make changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. The U.S. Basel III Rules became effective for RJF on January 1, 2015, subject to applicable phase-in periods. The rules governing the capital conservation buffer became effective for both RJF and RJ Bank as of January 1, 2016. See Note 25 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information regarding RJF and RJ Bank regulatory capital levels and ratios, including information regarding the capital conservation buffer. The increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; within this report for more information. 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary, and in certain cases, mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of RJF and RJ Bank. Under capital adequacy guidelines, RJF and RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification for RJF and RJ Bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of U.S. regulators based on components of capital, risk-weightings of assets, off-balance sheet transactions, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by federal banking regulations to ensure capital adequacy require that RJF, as a financial holding company, and RJ Bank maintain minimum amounts and ratios of: (i) Common Equity Tier 1 (or &#8220;CET1&#8221;), Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets; (ii) Tier 1 capital to average assets; and (iii) capital conservation buffers. See Item 7, &#8220;Regulatory&#8221; in this report and Note 25 &#32;of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, for further information. 

Money Market Funds 

In July 2014, the SEC adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds. The amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdrawals over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds, while preserving the benefits of the funds. We do not sponsor any money market funds. We utilize such funds in limited circumstances for our own investment purposes as well as to offer our clients with money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternatives. 

Municipal Advisor Regulation 

In September 2013, the SEC issued final rules regarding the mandatory registration of &#8220;municipal advisors&#8221; as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These final rules for municipal advisors, which became effective in July 2014: (i) impose a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities; (ii) may result in the need for new written representations by issuers; and (iii) may limit the manner in which we, in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles, interact with municipal issuers. Our municipal finance business became subject to additional regulation and oversight by the SEC by virtue of our registration with the SEC as a municipal advisor in 2014. In August 2014, the SEC also announced that it will undertake a two-year review of municipal advisors as part of an exam initiative. 

Moreover, in December 2015, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the &#8220;MSRB&#8221;) received approval from the SEC on new MSRB Rule G-42 (regarding duties of non-solicitor municipal advisors) and related amendments to MSRB Rule G-8 (regarding books and records to be made by municipal advisors, among others), all of which became effective in June 2016. Additional rulemaking by the MSRB may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local governments are able to interact with outside finance professionals. These new rules may impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients, as well as potentially have a negative short-term impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry attempts to adapt to the new regulatory landscape. However, we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations, which are included in our Capital Markets segment. 

Fiduciary Duty Standard 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC was charged with considering whether broker-dealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors. The SEC has not yet proposed rules relating to a new standard of conduct applicable to broker-dealers. However in April 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (the &#8220;DOL&#8221;) issued its final regulation (the &#8220;DOL Rule&#8221;) expanding the definition of who is deemed an &#8220;investment advice fiduciary&#8221; under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), as a result of giving investment advice to a &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;plan participant&#8221; or &#8220;beneficiary,&#8221; as well as under the Internal Revenue Code for individual retirement arrangements (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;) and non-ERISA plans (collectively, &#8220;qualified plans&#8221;). As a result of adopting a new definition of &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; under ERISA, the final rule extends fiduciary status to many investment professionals that have not been considered fiduciaries under current law. A fiduciary is subject to strict duties to act solely in the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is personally liable to the ERISA plan for breaches in its discharge of its duties. 

The DOL Rule also contains exemptions, including the Best Interest Contract exemption (the &#8220;BIC Exemption&#8221;) and Principal Transactions in Certain Assets exemption (the &#8220;Principal Transactions Exemption&#8221;), designed to enable investment professionals that will become fiduciaries to continue to operate under existing business models that would otherwise be prohibited, subject to compliance with new conditions. In order to rely on these exemptions, we will be required to: (i) act under defined impartial conduct standards that are in the best interest of our client; (ii) adopt certain anti-conflict policies and procedures; (iii) provide disclosure of certain information relating to fees, compensation and defined &#8220;material conflicts of interest;&#8221; (iv) provide a written acknowledgment of fiduciary status; and (v) for IRAs and non-ERISA plans, enter into an enforceable contract with our client that contains extensive warranties and does not allow exculpatory provisions waiving the client&#8217;s rights and remedies, including the right to participate in a class action in court. The DOL Rule became effective as of June 7, 2016, with phase-in of the fiduciary definition not applicable until April 10, 2017, and further transition periods until January 1, 2018 applying to both the BIC Exemption and Principal Transactions Exemption. 

We are evaluating the impact of the DOL Rule on our business. However, because qualified accounts, particularly IRA accounts, comprise a significant portion of our business, we expect that compliance with the DOL Rule and reliance on the BIC Exemption and the Principal Transactions Exemption will require us to incur increased legal, compliance and information technology costs. In addition, as discussed above, we may face enhanced legal risks. 

Incentive-Based Compensation Arrangements 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, six federal agencies are charged with jointly prescribing regulations or guidelines related to the prohibition of incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at certain financial institutions. The agencies have released a proposed rule that would prohibit certain forms of incentive-based compensation arrangements for financial institutions with greater than $1 billion in total assets (the &#8220;Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal&#8221;). Much of the Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal would apply to financial institutions categorized as either &#8220;Level 1&#8221; institutions (assets of $250 billion or more) or &#8220;Level 2&#8221; institutions (assets of $50 billion to $250 billion), while &#8220;Level 3&#8221; institutions (assets of $1 billion to $50 billion) would be subject to less extensive obligations. All covered financial institutions would be required to, among other requirements: (i) annually document the structure of their incentive-based compensation arrangements; (ii) retain records of such annual documentation for at least seven years; and (iii) comply with general prohibitions on incentive-based compensation arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risk-taking. Should the Incentive-Based Compensation Proposal be adopted, we would be subject to the rule&#8217;s requirements as a &#8220;Level 3&#8221; financial institution, which would require us to incur additional legal and compliance costs, as well as subject us to increased legal risks. 

Other regulations applicable to our operations 

The SEC is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws in the United States. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to SEC regulations relating to their business operations, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, privacy requirements, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business. RJ&#38;A and RJFS are currently registered as broker-dealers in all 50 states. 

Broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others, and are required to keep their assets in relatively liquid form. These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates. The SEC has adopted amendments to its financial stability rules, many of which became effective as of October 2013 and are applicable to our broker-dealer subsidiaries, including changes to the; (i) net capital rule; (ii) customer protection rule; (iii) record-keeping rules; and (iv) notification rules. We continue to evaluate the impact of these amendments on our broker-dealer subsidiaries; however, based on our current analysis, we do not believe these amendments will have a material adverse effect on any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries. 

Financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments, securities exchanges, central banks and regulatory bodies, particularly in those countries where they have established offices. Outside of the United States, we have additional offices in Europe, Canada and Latin America that are subject to local regulatory bodies in these territories. 

Much of the regulation of broker-dealers in the United States and Canada, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (&#8220;SROs&#8221;), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (&#8220;IIROC&#8221;) and securities exchanges. These SROs adopt and amend rules for regulating the industry, subject to the approval of government agencies. These SROs also conduct periodic examinations of member broker-dealers. 

The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees. Such administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and may adversely impact the reputation of a broker-dealer. 

Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act (&#8220;SIPA&#8221;) and are required by federal law to be members of the Securities Investors Protection Corporation (&#8220;SIPC&#8221;). The SIPC was established under SIPA, and oversees the liquidation of broker-dealers during liquidation or financial distress. The SIPC fund provides protection for cash and securities held in client accounts up to $500,000 per client, with a limitation of $250,000 on claims for cash balances. 

RJ Ltd. is currently registered in all provinces and territories in Canada. The financial services industry in Canada is subject to comprehensive regulation under both federal and provincial laws. Securities commissions have been established in all provinces and territorial jurisdictions, which are charged with the administration of securities laws. Investment dealers in Canada are also subject to regulation by SROs, which are responsible for the enforcement of, and conformity with, securities legislation for their members and have been granted the powers to prescribe their own rules of conduct and financial requirements of members. RJ Ltd. is regulated by each of the securities commissions in the jurisdictions of registration, as well as by the SROs and IIROC. IIROC requires that RJ Ltd. be a member of the Canadian Investors Protection Fund (the &#8220;CIPF&#8221;), whose primary role is investor protection. The CIPF provides protection for securities and cash held in client accounts up to $1 million Canadian currency (&#8220;CDN&#8221;) per client, with separate coverage of CDN $1 million for certain types of accounts. See Note 25 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on SEC, FINRA and IIROC regulations pertaining to broker-dealer regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 

Our investment advisory operations, including the mutual funds that we sponsor, are also subject to extensive regulation in the United States. Our U.S. asset managers are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as amended (the &#8220;Investment Advisers Act&#8221;), and are also required to make notice filings in certain states. Virtually all aspects of our asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit the asset management clients. 

RJ Bank is also subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;). The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound bank operations. Under the CRA, the Fed, the FDIC and the OCC are required to periodically examine and assign to each bank one of the following public CRA ratings: &#8220;outstanding;&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory;&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve;&#8221; or &#8220;substantial noncompliance.&#8221; Members of the public may submit comments on a bank&#8217;s performance under the CRA; such comments will form part of the bank&#8217;s performance evaluation. The results of the evaluation, together with the bank&#8217;s CRA rating, are also taken into consideration 

when evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. RJ Bank could face additional requirements and limitations should it fail to adequately meet the criteria stipulated under the CRA. 

Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 

The Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (&#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) and requirements administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) require financial institutions, among other things, to implement a risk-based program reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and to combat the financing of terrorism, including through suspicious activity and currency transaction reporting, compliance, record-keeping and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act also contains financial transparency laws and enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the U.S. government, including: due diligence and record-keeping requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; and rules to produce certain records upon request of a regulator or law enforcement and to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering and other crimes. Failure to meet the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act, or OFAC can lead to supervisory actions including fines.
