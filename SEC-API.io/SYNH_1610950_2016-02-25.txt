 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a leading global contract research organization ("CRO") based on revenues and are exclusively focused on Phase I to Phase IV clinical development services for the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries. We provide our customers highly differentiated therapeutic alignment and expertise, with a particular strength in complex therapeutic areas, such as central nervous system ("CNS"), oncology and other complex diseases. We consistently and predictably deliver clinical development services in a complex environment and offer a proprietary, operational approach to clinical trials through our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;methodology. Our service offerings focus on optimizing the development of, and therefore, the commercial potential for, our customers' new biopharmaceutical compounds, enhancing returns on their research and development ("R&#38;D") investments, and reducing their overhead by offering an attractive variable cost alternative to fixed cost, in-house resources. 

Founded more than two decades ago as an academic central nervous system research organization, we have translated that expertise into a global organization with a number of therapeutic specialties, as well as full data services and regulatory capabilities. Over the past decade, we have built our scale and capabilities to become a leading global provider of Phase I to Phase IV clinical development services, with approximately 6,400 &#32;employees in over 50 &#32;countries across six &#32;continents as of December 31, 2015 . Our broad global reach has enabled us to provide clinical development services in over 110 &#32;countries. Our global footprint provides our customers with broad access to diverse markets and patient populations, local regulatory expertise and local market knowledge. 

We provide clinical development services through specialized therapeutic teams that have deep scientific expertise and are strategically aligned with the largest and fastest growing areas of our customers' R&#38;D investments. We believe our therapeutic focus and proprietary methodology have set us apart within our industry. We were named the "Best Contract Research Organization" at the 11th Annual Scrip Awards ceremony in December 2015. The annual Scrip awards competition is organized by Scrip Intelligence to celebrate the contributions of the pharmaceutical, biotech and other allied industries to improving human health worldwide. The Company was selected from among several leading global CROs after being judged based on full range of services provided and quality of relationships built with clients by a distinguished panel of life science industry executives. 

We have also developed industry-leading relationships with principal investigators and clinical research sites, as demonstrated by being named the "Top CRO to Work With" among large global CROs in the 2015 CenterWatch Global Investigative Site Relationship Survey (the "2015 CenterWatch Survey") conducted by CenterWatch, a third-party leading publisher in the clinical trials industry. The 2015 CenterWatch Survey covered responses from over 1,900 &#32;sites globally that evaluated 11 &#32;CROs, including the top five by revenue, across 38 &#32;specific relationship attributes. We ranked in the top 3 &#32;on 33 &#32;out of the 38 &#32;specific relationship attributes. We believe the Company&#8217;s ranking as &#8220;Top CRO to Work With&#8221; for a second straight time demonstrates the effectiveness of our business model and our ability to deliver high-quality clinical trial results on time and on budget for our customers. 

Our extensive range of services supports the entire drug development process from Phase I to Phase IV and allows us to offer our customers an integrated suite of investigative site support and clinical development services. We offer these services across a wide variety of therapeutic areas with deep clinical expertise, with a primary focus on Phase I to Phase IV clinical trials. We provide total biopharmaceutical program development while also providing discrete services for any part of a trial. Our combination of service area experts and depth of clinical capability allows for enhanced protocol design and actionable trial data. 

We have two &#32;reportable segments: Clinical Development Services and Phase I Services. Clinical Development Services offers a variety of clinical development services, including full-service global studies, as well as ancillary services such as clinical monitoring, investigator recruitment, patient recruitment, data management, study reports to assist customers with their drug development process, quality assurance audits and specialized consulting services. Phase I Services focuses on clinical development services for Phase I trials, which include scientific exploratory medicine, first-in-human studies through proof-of-concept stages and support for Phase I studies in established compounds. For further information about the Company's reportable segments, please see "Note 12 &#32;- Segment Information" in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For financial information about geographic areas of our revenue and long-lived assets, please see "Note 13 &#32;- Operations by Geographic Location" in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. International operations expose us to risks that differ from those applicable to operating in the United States, including foreign currency translation and transaction risks, risks of changes in tax laws and other risks described further in Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we had total net service revenue of $914.7 million , net income of $117.0 million , Adjusted Net Income of $120.2 million , and Adjusted EBITDA of $221.4 million . For important disclosures about our non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA to our GAAP net income (loss), see Part II, Item 6, "Selected Financial Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information about our consolidated revenues and earnings, see our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our diversified customer base includes a mix of many of the world's largest biopharmaceutical companies as well as high-growth, small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. We deliver high quality service through our internally developed, metrics-driven Trusted Process &#174; , which is our proprietary methodology designed to reduce operational risk and variability by standardizing clinical development services and implement quality controls throughout the clinical development process. We believe our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;leads our customers to faster, better-informed drug development decisions. 

We were originally founded in 1998 as INC Research, and our headquarters are located in Raleigh, North Carolina. As a result of a corporate reorganization in connection with a business combination transaction, INC Research Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware in August 2010 . 

Our Market 

The market for our services includes biopharmaceutical companies that outsource clinical development services. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the following market trends: 

Trends in late-stage clinical development outsourcing. Within the clinical development market, we primarily focus on Phase II to Phase IV clinical trials. Biopharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the outsourcing of Phase II to Phase IV clinical trials, particularly in complex, high-growth therapeutic areas such as CNS, oncology and other complex diseases. Additionally, small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited infrastructure and therefore have a particular proclivity to outsource their clinical development to CROs. We estimate, based on industry sources, including analyst reports, and management's knowledge, that the market for CRO services for Phase II to Phase IV clinical development services will grow at a rate of 7% &#32;to 8% &#32;annually through 2020, driven by a combination of increased development spend and further outsourcing penetration. In addition, we estimate that total biopharmaceutical spending on drug development in 2015 was approximately $75.4 billion , of which the clinical development market, which is the market for drug development following pre-clinical research, was approximately $65.1 billion . Of the $65.1 billion , we estimate our total addressable market to be $52.5 billion , after excluding $12.6 billion &#32;of indirect fees paid to principal investigators and clinical research sites, which are not a part of the CRO market. We estimate that total biopharmaceutical spending on clinical development will grow at a rate of 3% &#32;to 4% &#32;annually through 2020. In 2015 , we estimate biopharmaceutical companies outsourced approximately $26.0 billion &#32;of clinical development spend to CROs, representing an 8% &#32;increase compared to 2014 and a penetration rate of 49% &#32;of our total addressable market. We estimate that this penetration rate will increase to approximately 59% &#32;of our total addressable market by 2020. We believe that CROs with deep therapeutic expertise, global reach and capabilities, the ability to conduct increasingly complex clinical trials and maintain strong principal investigator and clinical research site relationships will be well-positioned to benefit from these industry trends. 

Optimization of biopharmaceutical R&#38;D efficiency. Market forces and healthcare reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the "Affordable Care Act") and other governmental initiatives, place significant pressure on biopharmaceutical companies to improve cost efficiency. Companies need to demonstrate the relative improvement in quality, safety, and effectiveness of new therapies as compared to existing approved therapies as early as possible in the development process. CROs can help biopharmaceutical companies deploy capital more efficiently, especially because many biopharmaceutical companies do not have adequate in-house development resources. In response to high clinical trial costs, particularly in therapeutic areas such as CNS and oncology, which we believe present the highest mean cost per patient across all clinical trials, biopharmaceutical companies are streamlining operations and shifting development to external providers in order to lower their fixed costs. Based on efficiencies gained through experience, we estimate that CROs have shortened clinical testing timelines by as much as 30%. Full service CROs can deliver operational efficiencies, provide high visibility into trial conduct, and allow biopharmaceutical companies to focus internal resources on their core competencies related to drug discovery and commercialization. 

Globalization of clinical trials. Clinical trials have become increasingly global as biopharmaceutical companies seek to accelerate patient recruitment, particularly within protocol-eligible, treatment-na&#239;ve patient populations without co-morbidities that could skew clinical outcomes. Additionally, biopharmaceutical companies increasingly seek to expand the commercial potential of their products by applying for regulatory approvals in multiple countries, including in areas of the world with fast-growing economies and middle classes that are spending more on healthcare. As part of the approval process for biopharmaceutical products in newer markets, especially in certain Asian and emerging markets, regulators often require trials to include specific percentages or numbers of people from local populations. Thus, clinical studies to support marketing approval applications frequently include a combination of multinational and domestic trials. These trends emphasize the importance of global experience and geographic coverage, local market knowledge and coordination throughout the development process. 

Management of increasingly complex trials. The biopharmaceutical industry operates in an increasingly sophisticated and highly regulated environment and has responded to the demands of novel therapeutics by adapting efficient drug development processes. Complex trial design expertise has emerged as a significant competitive advantage for select CROs that have a track record of successfully navigating country-specific regulatory, trial protocol and patient enrollment barriers, including sometimes subjective, evolving clinical endpoints. Measures of clinical trial complexity significantly increased over the last decade, as evidenced by total procedures per trial protocol increasing by 57% between 2000 and 2011. In addition, the therapeutic areas where we have a particular focus, including CNS, oncology and other complex diseases, often require more complicated testing protocols than other disease indications. For example, studies related to complex 

therapeutic areas often require treatment-na&#239;ve patients, and sometimes have subjective endpoints, which can be difficult to measure. In addition, many of these studies have longer periods of duration due to these factors and have been increasing in duration over the last 24 months. For example, our average study duration has increased from approximately 30 months as of December 31, 2013 to slightly over 40 months as of December 31, 2015 . As a result of these factors, these therapeutic areas demand greater clinical trial proficiency and therapeutic expertise, particularly in light of new methods of testing, such as the use of biomarkers and gene therapy. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on positive trends in the CRO industry and provide differentiated solutions to our customers based on our key competitive strengths set forth below: 

Deep and long-standing expertise in the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. &#32;Since our inception in 1998, we have focused on building world-class therapeutic expertise to better serve our customers. We provide a broad offering of therapeutic expertise, with our core focus in the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas, including our complex therapeutic areas, which collectively constitute approximately 66% &#32;of our backlog as of December 31, 2015 . Based on industry data, we estimate that these complex therapeutic areas together represent over 60% &#32;of total Phase III drugs under development. We believe we have been growing faster than the market, resulting in market share gains in our key therapeutic areas. In 2015 , our net service revenue grew by 13% &#32;and our net service revenue for our complex therapeutic areas grew by 18% . Our therapeutic expertise is managed by our senior leadership and delivered by our senior scientific and medical staff and our clinical research associates ("CRAs") within our various therapeutic areas. Industry analysts have reported that therapeutic expertise is the most influential factor for small to mid-cap as well as large sponsors of clinical trials in selecting a CRO. We believe that our expertise in managing complex clinical trials differentiates us from our competitors and has played a key role in our revenue growth, our ability to win new clinical trials and our successful relationship development with principal investigators and clinical research sites. 

Clinical development focus and innovative operating model. &#32;&#32;We derive approximately 98% &#32;of our net service revenue from clinical development services without distraction from lower growth, lower margin non-clinical business. Since 2006, we have conducted our clinical trials using our innovative Trusted Process &#174; &#32;operating model, which standardizes methodologies, increases the predictability of the delivery of our services and reduces operational risk. Since initiation of the Trusted Process &#174; , we have reduced median study start-up time (defined as the period from finalized protocol to first patient enrolled) on new projects. Based on industry sources for the median study start-up time for the biopharmaceutical industry, we believe we achieve this milestone for our customers at a faster pace than industry medians, due in part to our proprietary Trusted Process &#174; &#32;operating model. In addition to the absolute reduction of cycle times in critical path milestones, we provide greater operating efficiency, more predictable project schedules and a reduction in overall project timelines. We were named the "Best Contract Research Organization" at the 11th Annual Scrip Awards in December 2015, which we believe is directly attributable to our innovative business model. 

Unmatched, industry-leading principal investigator and clinical research site relationships. &#32;&#32;We have extensive relationships with principal investigators and clinical research sites. We believe these quality relationships are critical for delivering clinical trial results on time and on budget for our customers. Motivated and engaged investigative sites can facilitate faster patient recruitment, increase retention, maintain safety, ensure compliance with protocols as well as with local and international regulations, and streamline reporting. The ability to recruit and retain principal investigators and patients is an integral part of the clinical trial process. We have dedicated personnel focused on enhancing clinical research site relationships; we work with these sites in collaborative partnerships to improve cycle times and standardize start-up activities to drive efficiency. Our focus on principal investigator and clinical research site relationships is unmatched in the industry, as demonstrated by being named "Best Contract Research Organization" in December 2015 by an independent panel for Scrip Intelligence and our ranking as the "Top CRO to Work With" among large global CROs in the 2015 CenterWatch Survey. In the 2015 CenterWatch Survey, we ranked in the top 3 &#32;on 33 &#32;out of 38 &#32;attributes and received an average of 83% &#32;of "excellent" or "good" ratings across all attributes, up from approximately 80% &#32;in 2013. In addition, we are a top-three ranked CRO on four of the five attributes rated by sites as most important to study conduct success and the number one-ranked CRO for providing professional 

medical staff in clinical operations. We also participate at the highest level of membership within the Society for Clinical Research Sites ("SCRS") as a Global Impact Partner ("GIP"). 

Broad global reach with in-depth local market knowledge. &#32;&#32;We believe that we are one of a few CROs with the scale, expertise, systems and agility necessary to conduct global clinical trials. We offer our services through a highly skilled staff of approximately 6,400 &#32;employees in over 50 &#32;countries as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and have conducted work in over 110 &#32;countries. We continue to have a presence in high-growth international markets such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa. Our comprehensive regulatory expertise and extensive local knowledge facilitate timely patient recruitment for complex clinical trials and improved access to treatment-na&#239;ve patients and to emerging markets, thereby reducing the time and cost of these trials for our customers while also optimizing the commercialization potential for new therapies. 

Diversified, loyal and growing customer base. &#32;&#32;We have a well-diversified, loyal customer base of over 300 &#32;customers that includes many of the world's largest biopharmaceutical companies as well as high-growth, small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. We have several customers with whom we have achieved "preferred provider" or strategic alliance relationships. We define these customer relationships to include ones where we have executed master service agreements in addition to regularly scheduled strategy meetings to discuss the status of our relationship, and for which we serve as a preferred supplier of services. We believe these relationships provide us enhanced opportunities for more business, although they are not a guarantee of future business. In addition, many of our customers are diversified across multiple projects and compounds. Our top five customers represented approximately 71 &#32;compounds in 47 &#32;indications across 200 &#32;active projects and accounted for approximately 34% &#32;of our net service revenue in 2015 . Our customer base is geographically diverse with well-established relationships in the United States, Europe and Asia. We believe the breadth of our footprint reduces our exposure to potential U.S. and European biopharmaceutical industry consolidation. We believe that the tenure of our customer relationships as well as the depth of penetration of our services reflect our strong reputation and track record. While 86% &#32;of our new business awards in 2015 &#32;were from repeat customers and our top ten customers have worked with us for an average of more than 10 &#32;years, we were also awarded clinical trials from 72 &#32;new customers in 2015 , with particularly strong growth among small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. We have also increased our penetration in the large biopharmaceutical market, which we define as the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies measured by annual drug revenue, with 59% &#32;of our net service revenue in 2015 &#32;coming from large biopharmaceutical companies. We believe we have increased our market share in recent years and are well positioned to continue growing our customer base. 

Outstanding financial performance. &#32;&#32;We have achieved significant revenue and EBITDA growth over the past several years. For example, during 2015 , we increased our net service revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income by 13% , 52% , and 169% , respectively, as compared to 2014 , and ended the year with net income of $117.0 million , compared to that of a net loss of $23.5 million &#32;in 2014 . The momentum in our business is also reflected in the growth in our backlog and new business awards (which is the value of future net service revenue supported by contracts or pre-contract written communications from customers for projects that have received appropriate internal funding approval, are not contingent upon completion of another trial or event and are expected to commence within the next 12 months, minus the value of cancellations in the same period). Backlog and new business awards are not necessarily predictive of future financial performance because they will likely be impacted by a number of factors, including the size and duration of projects (which can be performed over several years), project change orders resulting in increases or decreases in project scope, and cancellations. For the period from December 31, 2014 &#32;to December 31, 2015 , our backlog increased by 14% &#32;and net new business awards grew by 24% . We believe our outstanding financial profile and strong momentum demonstrate the quality of the platform we have built to position ourselves for continued future growth. 

Highly experienced management team with a deep-rooted culture of quality and innovation. &#32;&#32;We are led by a dedicated and experienced senior management team with significant industry experience and knowledge focused on clinical development. Each of the members of our senior management has 20 years or more of relevant experience, including significant experience across the CRO and biopharmaceutical industries. Our management team has successfully grown our company into a leading CRO through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions and believes we are well positioned to further capitalize on industry growth trends. 

Business Strategy 

The key elements of our business strategy include: 

Focus on attractive, high-growth late-stage clinical development services market. We believe outsourcing late-stage clinical development services to CROs optimizes returns on invested R&#38;D for biopharmaceutical companies. As development spend and outsourcing penetration rates continue to increase, we estimate that the late-stage clinical development services market will grow at a rate of 7% &#32;to 8% &#32;annually through 2020 and is poised to realize incremental growth relative to the overall CRO market. We believe that our core focus on the late-stage clinical development services market ideally positions us to benefit from this growth trend. Additionally, we believe that our differentiated approach of investing in highly experienced people, making better use of enabling technology and improving the process of clinical development, will allow our customers to generate superior returns. 

Leverage our expertise in complex clinical trials. We intend to continue to develop and leverage our therapeutic expertise in complex clinical trials. We believe that our focus on and deep expertise in complex therapeutic areas such as CNS, oncology and other complex diseases better position us to win new clinical trials in these fast growing and large therapeutic areas. This is enhanced by the use of our proprietary Trusted Process &#174; &#32;methodology that reduces operational risk and variability by standardizing processes and minimizing delays, instills quality throughout the clinical development process and leads customers to more confident, better-informed drug development decisions. 

Capitalize on our geographic scale. We intend to leverage our global breadth and scale to drive continued growth. We have built our presence across key markets over time, developing strong relationships with principal investigators and clinical research sites around the world. We have expanded our patient recruitment capabilities, principal investigator relationships and local regulatory knowledge, which should continue to position us well for new customer wins in a wide array of markets. We have added geographic reach through both acquisitions and organic growth in areas such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East and North Africa, which we believe is critical to obtaining larger new business awards from large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. Our long-term growth opportunities are enhanced by our strong reputation in emerging markets and our track record of efficiently managing trials in accordance with regional regulatory requirements. 

Continue to enhance our Trusted Process &#174; &#32; methodology to deliver superior outcomes. We intend to continue the development and enhancement of our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;methodology, which has delivered measurable, beneficial results for our customers and improved drug development decisions. We believe our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;will continue to lead to high levels of customer satisfaction. Our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;is subject to continual refinement based on feedback from therapeutic leadership, staff and customers as well as the market factors of an evolving regulatory environment and technology innovation. Our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;uses best-in-class and industry-leading third-party technology solutions. We expect that through continuous enhancement of our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;methodology, we will achieve better alignment of best-in-class technology to enable increased visibility into critical processes, management and controls in the drug development process. We intend to continue to position ourselves to quickly adopt best-in-class technology through effective third-party collaborations without the need for high capital investments and maintenance costs, driving attractive returns on capital. 

Continue proven track record of identifying and successfully integrating selective acquisitions to augment our organic growth. Over the past decade, we have developed a systematic approach for integrating acquisitions. We have successfully acquired and integrated ten companies. These strategic acquisitions have increased our size, scale and reach, complementing our organic growth profile as we have become a leading provider of CRO services. Our acquisitions have enabled us to expand our global service offerings across all four phases of biopharmaceutical clinical development while also allowing us to achieve significant synergies and cost reductions. For example, in March 2014 we completed the acquisition of MEK Consulting, which expanded our presence in the high-growth Middle East and North Africa market. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire and integrate selective tuck-in acquisitions within the CRO sector in order to strengthen our competitive position and realize attractive returns on our investments. 

Drive our human capital asset base to grow existing relationships. As a clinical service provider, our employees are critical to our ability to deliver our innovative operational model by engaging with customers, 

delivering clinical development services in a complex environment, and supporting and executing our growth strategy. All employees undergo comprehensive initial orientation and ongoing training, including a focus on our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;methodology. Our recruiting and retention efforts are geared toward maintaining and growing a stable work force focused on delivering results for customers. We have a successful track record of integrating talent from prior acquisitions and believe we have a best-in-class pool of highly experienced project management professionals and CRAs.

Our regulatory affairs practice has a global presence with offices in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. In addition, subject matter experts are located worldwide to provide global regulatory coverage. Global regulatory services include worldwide regulatory submissions, regulatory strategy and agency meetings, early development consultancy, data safety monitoring board and data review committee management, chemistry manufacturing and controls, contemporary regulatory interpretation, investigational new drug ("IND"), applications and clinical trial authorizations. 

Post-Approval Services 

Our post-approval services are focused on efficient delivery of studies and support programs. These studies and programs include specialized support for patient registries, safety surveillance studies, prospective observational studies, health outcome research, patient reported outcomes, Phase IV effectiveness trials, health economics studies and retrospective chart reviews. Our proprietary post-approval study management system provides real-time support for sites and up-to-date status reports for sponsors. 

Our Trusted Process &#174; &#32; Methodology 

We perform each of these service offerings through our proprietary, operational approach to clinical trials. Our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;is a metrics-driven methodology that we employ to deliver superior results to our customers. We developed this process to improve reliability and predictability of clinical trial project management. Our Trusted Process &#174; &#32;methodology has allowed us to reduce operational risk and variability as well as provide faster cycle times. This has resulted in greater operating efficiency, highly predictable project timelines and enhanced customer satisfaction and retention rates. 

The Trusted Process &#174; &#32;methodology is divided into four sub-processes which correlate with the key phases of a clinical project: 

&#8226; 

PlanActivation &#174; &#160;&#8212; the design &#32;phase, where a project is analyzed and a strategy developed utilizing our therapeutic and clinical experience, forming the basis of a customized project proposal. The strategy continues to be refined based on discussions with the customer through new business award. 

&#8226; 

QuickStart &#174; &#160;&#8212; the initiating &#32;phase, which serves to align the customer's and our project teams to a single set of objectives, create shared expectations and develop a joint plan for project implementation. 

&#8226; 

ProgramAccelerate &#174; &#160;&#8212; the execution &#32;and control &#32;phase, which includes the processes of patient recruitment, clinical monitoring and data management. In this phase, we proactively process and review data to ensure quality and project timelines are actively managed, while maintaining strong relationships with investigative sites. 

&#8226; 

QualityFinish &#174; &#160;&#8212; the closing &#32;phase, which is triggered by the first enrolled patient completing the clinical trial. This phase focuses on assuring high quality, actionable data is used to develop the final 

deliverables which make up the basis of the documentation necessary for filing with regulatory agencies. 

Since 2006, we have conducted studies using the tools and discipline of the Trusted Process &#174; . We accomplish standardized delivery through support from a company-wide Project Management Office, which defines, maintains and improves procedures relating to the Trusted Process &#174; &#32;and ensures consistent application globally. Using this innovative operating model, we have reduced median study start-up time (defined as the period from finalized protocol to first patient enrolled) on new projects. Based on industry sources for the median study start-up time for the pharmaceutical industry, we believe we achieve this milestone for our customers at a faster pace than industry medians, as a result of our proprietary Trusted Process &#174; &#32;operating model. 

Customers 

We have a well-diversified, loyal customer base that includes many of the world's largest biopharmaceutical companies, which we define as the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies measured by annual drug revenue. In addition, we have strong relationships with small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical customers that seek our services for our therapeutic expertise and full-service offering. 

Since December 31, 2010, we have significantly increased our exposure to large biopharmaceutical customers through both acquisitions and organic growth, providing us the opportunity to compete for large, global late-stage clinical development trials, preferred provider lists and strategic multi-year relationships. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our net service revenue attributable to large biopharmaceutical companies represented approximately 59% &#32;of our total net service revenue and net service revenue attributable to small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies represented approximately 41% . Additionally, we serve customers in a variety of locations throughout the world, with approximately 48% &#32;of our workforce based in the United States and Canada, 34% &#32;in Europe, 11% &#32;in Asia-Pacific, 6% &#32;in Latin America and 1% &#32;in the Middle East and Africa as of December 31, 2015 . This diversification allows us to grow our business in multiple customer segments and geographies. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our top five customers accounted for approximately 34% &#32;of our net service revenue which was diversified across approximately 71 compounds in 47 &#32;indications across 200 &#32;active projects. No &#32;customer accounted for 10% &#32;or more of net service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Our top ten customers have worked with us for an average of more than 10 &#32;years as of December 31, 2015 . We also have a growing list of "preferred provider" and/or strategic alliance relationships. Further, among the majority of our customers, revenue is diversified by multiple projects for a variety of compounds. For example, 36 &#32;of our customers have active projects in more than one therapeutic area, making up 54% &#32;of our net service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 . We believe that the tenure of our customer relationships as well as the depth of penetration of our services reflects our strong reputation and track record. 

New Business Awards and Backlog 

We add new business awards to backlog when we enter into a contract or letter of intent or when we receive a written commitment from the customer selecting us as its service provider. Contracts generally have terms ranging from several months to several years. We recognize revenue on these awards as services are performed, provided we have entered into a contractual commitment with the customer. Our new business awards, net of cancellations of prior awards, for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were approximately $1.18 billion , $0.95 billion &#32;and $0.81 billion , respectively. 

Backlog consists of anticipated future net service revenue from contracts, letters of intent and other written forms of commitments that either have not started but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. The majority of our contracts can be terminated by our customers with 30 days' notice. Our backlog also reflects any related cancellation or adjustment activity. Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was approximately $1.81 billion , $1.59 billion &#32;and $1.49 billion , respectively. Included within backlog at December 31, 2015 &#32;is approximately $0.84 billion &#32;that we expect to 

translate into revenue in 2016 . Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future financial performance because it will likely be impacted by a number of factors, including the size and duration of projects (which can be performed over several years), project change orders resulting in increases or decreases in project scope and cancellations. 

No assurance can be given that we will be able to realize the net service revenue that is included in the backlog. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risk Relating to Our Business - Our backlog might not be indicative of our future revenues, and we might not realize all the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog," and Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - New Business Awards and Backlog" for more information. 

Sales and Marketing 

We employ a team of business development sales representatives and support staff that promote, market and sell our services to biopharmaceutical companies primarily in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. In addition to significant selling experience, many of these individuals have technical and/or scientific backgrounds. 

Our business development team works with our senior executives, therapeutic leaders and project team leaders to maintain key customer relationships and engage in business development activities. For many of our largest customer relationships, we have dedicated strategic account management teams to provide customers with a single point of contact to support delivery, cultural and process integration and to facilitate cross-selling opportunities. 

We use integrated and customer-focused business development teams to develop joint sales plans for key accounts. We also place our business development personnel with strong operational experience around the globe to help ensure project demands are fulfilled. Each business development employee is generally responsible for a specific group of customers and for strengthening and expanding an effective relationship with that customer. Each individual is responsible for developing his or her customer base on our behalf, responding to customer requests for information, developing and defending proposals, and making presentations to customers. 

As part of each customer proposal, our business development personnel consult with potential biopharmaceutical customers early in the project consideration stage in order to determine their requirements. We involve our therapeutic, operational, technical and/or scientific personnel early in each proposal and, accordingly, these individuals along with our business development representatives invest significant time to determine the optimal means to design and execute the potential customer's program requirements. As an example, recommendations we make to a potential customer with respect to a drug development study design and implementation are an integral part of our bid proposal process and an important aspect of the integrated services we offer. Our preliminary efforts relating to the evaluation of a proposed clinical protocol and implementation plan, along with the therapeutic expertise and advice we provide during this process, enhance the opportunity for accelerated initiation and overall success of the trial. 

Our marketing team supports our business development organization through various marketing activities to drive brand awareness and positioning, consisting primarily of market and competitive analysis, brand management, market information and collateral development, participation in industry conferences, advertising, e-marketing, publications, and website development and maintenance. 

Competition 

We compete primarily against other full-service CROs and services provided by in-house R&#38;D departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities and teaching hospitals. Although the CRO industry has experienced increased consolidation over the past three years, the landscape remains fragmented. Our major competitors include ICON plc, inVentiv Health, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (formerly Covance, Inc.), PAREXEL International Corporation, Pharmaceutical Product Development, LLC, PRA Health Sciences, Inc., Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc. and numerous specialty and regional players. We generally compete on the basis of the following factors: 

&#8226; 

experience within specific therapeutic areas; 

&#8226; 

the quality of staff and services; 

&#8226; 

the range of services provided; 

&#8226; 

the ability to recruit principal investigators and patients into studies expeditiously; 

&#8226; 

the ability to organize and manage large-scale, global clinical trials; 

&#8226; 

an international presence with strategically located facilities; 

&#8226; 

medical database management capabilities; 

&#8226; 

the ability to deploy and integrate IT systems to improve the efficiency of contract research; 

&#8226; 

experience with a particular customer; 

&#8226; 

the ability to form strategic partnerships; 

&#8226; 

speed to completion; 

&#8226; 

financial strength and stability; 

&#8226; 

price; and 

&#8226; 

overall value. 

Notwithstanding these competitive factors, we believe that our deep therapeutic expertise, global reach and operational strength differentiate us from our competitors. 

Government Regulation 

Regardless of the country or region in which approval is being sought, before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must undergo rigorous testing in clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the United States and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations require the drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval. 

In the United States, the FDA regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. In the European Union ("EU") and other jurisdictions where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization, similar laws and regulations apply. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA, and requirements vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, and other Asian countries, where we operate or where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization. Sponsors of clinical trials also follow ICH E6 guidelines. 

Our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the United States, we must perform our clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including GCP, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the clinical product candidate must file an IND with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of preclinical tests, manufacturer information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. In addition, under GCP, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional review board ("IRB") which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may 

suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

Clinical trials conducted outside the United States are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other study materials. Studies conducted outside the United States can also be subject to regulation by the FDA if the studies are conducted pursuant to an IND or an investigational device exemption for a product candidate that will seek FDA approval or clearance. It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled. 

In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things: 

&#8226; 

comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites; 

&#8226; 

obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators; 

&#8226; 

obtain review, approval and supervision of the clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee; 

&#8226; 

obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial; 

&#8226; 

verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial; 

&#8226; 

ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner; 

&#8226; 

monitor the validity and accuracy of data; 

&#8226; 

monitor drug or biologic accountability at clinical research sites; and 

&#8226; 

verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review. 

Similar guidelines exist in various states and in other countries. We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory standards and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed." 

We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the United States, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated guidelines. 

In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations in Canada and Spain. 

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has promulgated rules under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in connection with the application of security and privacy provisions under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (collectively, "HIPAA"). These regulations govern the use, handling and disclosure of personally identifiable medical information. Although we do not consider that our business activities generally cause us to be subject to HIPAA as a covered entity, we endeavor to embrace sound identity protection practices. These regulations also establish procedures for the exercise of an individual's rights and the methods permissible for de-identification of health information. We are also subject to privacy legislation in Canada under the federal Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act, the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector and the Personal Health Information Protection Act, and privacy legislation in the EU under the 95/46/EC Privacy Directive on the protection and free movement of personal data. 

Intellectual Property 

We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for trademarks and copyright protection in the United States and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Trusted Process &#174; , PlanActivation, QuickStart, ProgramAccelerate, QualityFinish, and INC Research and other corporate emblems. Although the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material licenses, franchises or concessions. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;we had approximately 6,400 &#32;full-time equivalent employees worldwide, with approximately 48% &#32;in the United States and Canada, 34% &#32;in Europe, 11% &#32;in Asia-Pacific, 6% &#32;in Latin America and 1% &#32;in the Middle East and Africa. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our overall relations with our employees are good. Employees in certain of our non-U.S. locations are represented by workers' councils as required by local laws. 

The level of competition among employers in the United States and overseas for skilled personnel is high. We believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are advantages in attracting qualified candidates. In addition, we believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers. 

Indemnification and Insurance 

In conjunction with our clinical development services, we employ or contract with research institutions and in some jurisdictions principal investigators and pharmacies on behalf of biopharmaceutical companies to serve as research centers and principal investigators in conducting clinical trials to test new drugs on human volunteers. Such testing creates the risk of liability for personal injury or death of volunteers, particularly to volunteers with life-threatening illnesses, resulting from adverse reactions to the drugs administered. It is possible that we could be held liable for claims and expenses arising from any professional malpractice of the principal investigators with whom we contract or employ, or in the event of personal injury to or death of persons participating in clinical trials. In addition, as a result of our operation of Phase I clinical trial facilities, we could be liable for the general risks associated with clinical trials including, but not limited to, adverse events resulting from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of medical care providers. We also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform through each of our service groups. For example, we could be held liable for errors or omissions, or breach of contract, if monitoring obligations have been transferred to us and one of our CRA's inaccurately reports from source documents or fails to adequately monitor a human clinical trial resulting in inaccurately recorded results. 

We have sought to reduce our risks by implementing the following where practicable: 

&#8226; 

securing contractual assurances such as indemnification provisions and provisions seeking to limit or exclude liability contained in our contracts with customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors and principal investigators; 

&#8226; 

securing contractual and other assurances that adequate insurance will be maintained to the extent applicable by customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors, principal investigators and by us; and 

&#8226; 

complying with various regulatory requirements, including monitoring that the oversight of independent review boards and ethics committees are intact where obligations are transferred to us and monitoring the oversight of the procurement by the principal investigator of each participant's informed consent to participate in the study. 

The contractual indemnifications we have generally do not fully protect us against certain of our own actions, such as negligence. Contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation with customers, and the terms and scope of any indemnification, limitation of liability or exclusion of liability varies from customer to customer and from trial to trial. Additionally, financial performance of these indemnities is not secured. Therefore, we bear the risk that any indemnifying party against which we have claims may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us. 

While we maintain professional liability insurance that covers the locations in which we currently do business and that covers drug safety issues as well as data processing and other errors and omissions, it is possible that we could become subject to claims not covered by insurance or that exceed our coverage limits. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside the scope of, or in excess of, a contractual indemnification provision, beyond the level of insurance coverage or not covered by insurance, or in the event that an indemnifying party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations.
