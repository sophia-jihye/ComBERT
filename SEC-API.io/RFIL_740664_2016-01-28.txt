Operating Divisions 

&#160;

Connector and Cable Assembly Division The Connector and Cable Assembly Division is engaged in the design, manufacture and distribution of coaxial connector solutions for companies that design, build, operate, maintain and use wireless voice, data, messaging, and location tracking systems. Coaxial connector products consist primarily of connectors which, when attached to a coaxial cable, facilitate the transmission of analog and digital signals in various frequencies. Although most of the connectors are designed to fit standard products, the Company also sells custom connectors specifically designed and manufactured to suit its customers&#8217; requirements such as the Wi-Fi and broadband wireless markets. The Company&#8217;s Connector and Cable Assembly Division typically carry over 1,500 different types of connectors, adapters, tools, and test and measurements kits. The Company&#8217;s RF connectors are used in thousands of different devices, products and types of equipment. While the models and types of devices, products and equipment may change from year to year, the demand for the types of connectors used in such products and offered by the Company does not fluctuate with the changes in the end product incorporating the connectors. In addition, since the Company&#8217;s standard connectors can be used in a number of different products and devices, the discontinuation of one product does not make the Company&#8217;s connectors obsolete. Accordingly, most connectors carried by the Company can be marketed for a number of years and are only gradually phased out. Furthermore, because the Company&#8217;s connector products are not dependent on any line of products or any market segment, the Company&#8217;s overall sales of connectors do not fluctuate materially when there are changes to any product line or market segment. Sales of the Company&#8217;s connector products are, however, dependent upon the overall economy, infrastructure build out by large telecommunications firms and on the Company&#8217;s ability to market its products.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Cable assembly products consist of various types of coaxial cables that are attached to connectors (usually the Company&#8217;s connectors) for use in a variety of communications applications. Cable assemblies manufactured for the Connector and Cable Assembly Division are manufactured at the Company&#8217;s California facilities using state-of-the-art automation equipment and are sold through distributors or directly to major OEM accounts. Cable assemblies consist of both standard cable assemblies and assemblies that are custom manufactured for the Company&#8217;s clients. The Company offers a line of cable assemblies with over 100,000 cable product combinations. The Company launched its cable assembly operations in 2000.

&#160;

The Connector and Cable Assembly Division also includes Oddcables.com, formerly a stand-alone division that sells coaxial, fiber optic and other connectors and cable assemblies on a retail basis.

The majority of the export sales during these periods were to Canada, Mexico and Israel.

&#160;

The Company does not own, or directly operate any manufacturing operations or sales offices in foreign countries.

&#160;

Distribution, Marketing and Customers 

&#160;

Sales methods vary greatly between the Company&#8217;s divisions. The Connector and Cable Assembly Division, the Cables Unlimited Division and the Rel-Tech Electronics Division currently sell their products primarily through warehousing distributors and OEM customers who utilize coaxial connectors and cable assemblies in the manufacture of their products.

&#160;

Comnet Telecom also sells certain of its products to large, national telecommunication equipment and solution providers who include Comnet Telecom&#8217;s products in their own product offerings.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

The Connector and Cable Assembly Division, contracts with outside third parties for the manufacture of a significant portion of its coaxial connectors. However, virtually all of the RF cable assemblies sold by the Connector and Cable Assembly Division during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015 were assembled by the Cable Assembly side, an approved ISO factory, of the Connector and Cable Assembly Division at the Company&#8217;s facilities in California. The Connector and Cable Assembly Division procures its raw cable from manufacturers with ISO approved factories in the United States, China and Taiwan. The Company is dependent on primarily 8 manufacturers for its coaxial connectors, tools and other passive components and several plants for raw cable. Although the Company does not have manufacturing agreements with these manufacturers for its connectors and cable products, the Company does have long-term purchasing relationships with these manufacturers. There are certain risks associated with the Company&#8217;s dependence on third party manufacturers for some of its products. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below. The Company has in-house design engineers who create the engineering drawings for fabrication and assembly of connectors and cable assemblies. Accordingly, the manufacturers are not primarily responsible for design work related to the manufacture of the connectors and cable assemblies.

&#160;

The Bioconnect Division has designed and manufactured its own products for over 25 years (including as an unaffiliated company before being acquired by the Company in 2000). Bioconnect products are manufactured by the Company at its own ISO approved California facilities. The manufacturing process for the Bioconnect medical cables includes all aspects of the product, from the design to mold design, mold fabrication, assembly and testing. The Bioconnect product line produces its medical interconnect products in both high volume manufacturing and for custom or low volume uses.

&#160;

Cables Unlimited manufactures its custom cable assemblies, adapters and electromechanical wiring harnesses and other products in its Yaphank, New York manufacturing facility. Cables Unlimited is an ISO approved factory, as well as a Corning Cable Systems CAH Connections SM Gold Program member, authorized to manufacture fiber optic products and assemblies that are backed by Corning Cable Systems' extended warranty. Cables Unlimited outsources the assembly of a portion of its new OptiFlex cable to a third party manufacturer.

&#160;

Raw Materials 

&#160;

Connector materials are typically made of commodity metals such as copper, brass and zinc and include small applications of precious materials, including silver and gold. The Connector and Cable Division purchases most of its connector products from contract manufacturers located in Asia and the United States. The Company believes that the raw materials used in its products are readily available and that the Company is not currently dependent on any supplier for its raw materials. The Company does not currently have any long-term purchase or supply agreements with its connector or suppliers. The Cable Assembly Group obtains coaxial connectors from RF Connector group. The Company believes there are numerous domestic and international suppliers of coaxial connectors.

&#160;

Bioconnect cable assembly materials are typically made of commodity materials such as plastics, rubber, resins and wire. The Company believes materials and components used in these products are readily available from a number of domestic suppliers and from other foreign suppliers.

&#160;

The Cables Unlimited Division, Comnet Telecom Division and the Rel-Tech Electronics Division purchase all of their products from manufacturers located in the United States. Fiber optic cables are available from various manufacturers located throughout the United States; however, both Cables Unlimited and Comnet Telecom purchase most of their fiber optic cables from Corning Cables Systems LLC. The Company believes that the raw materials used by Cables Unlimited and Comnet Telecom in their products are readily available and that neither division is not currently dependent on any supplier for its raw materials except where Corning Extended Warranty certification is required. Neither Cables Unlimited, nor Comnet Telecom nor Rel-Tech Electronics currently have any long-term purchase or supply agreements with their connector and cable suppliers.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of October 31, 2015, the Company employed 226 full-time employees, of whom 55 were in accounting, administration, sales and management, 160 were in manufacturing, distribution and assembly, and 5 were engineers engaged in design, engineering and research and development. The employees were based at the Company&#8217;s offices in San Diego, California (75 employees), Las Vegas, Nevada (5 employees), Yaphank, New York (42 employees), Milford, Connecticut (74 employees) and East Brunswick, New Jersey (30 employees). In December 2015, the Company sold the Aviel division and, as a result, no longer employs any employees in Nevada. The Company also occasionally hires part-time employees. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its employees. The Cables Unlimited Division employs six cable installers who are currently represented by a union. Other than the foregoing installers that belong to a union, none of the Comp any&#8217;s other employees are unionized. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company&#8217;s research and development expenses relate to its engineering activities, which consist of the design and development of new products for specific customers, as well as the design and engineering of new or redesigned products for the industry in general. During the years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized $923,000 and $948,000 in engineering expenses, respectively.

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

&#160;

The Company owns 13 U.S. patents related to CompPro Product Line that it acquired in May 2015. The CompPro Product Line utilizes a patented compression technology that offers revolutionary advantages for a water-tight connection, easier installation, and improved system reliability on braided cables. The CompPro Product Line is used by wireless network operators, installers and distributors in North America and other parts of the world. The Company also owns the &#8220;CompPro&#8221; registered trademark associated with the compression cable product line.

&#160;

The Company uses &#8220;OptiFlex&#8482;&#8221; as a trademark for its hybrid cable wireless tower cable solution.

&#160;

Because the Company carries thousands of separate types of connectors and other products, most of which are available in standard sizes and configuration and are also offered by the Company&#8217;s competitors, the Company does not believe that its business or competitive position is dependent on patent protection.

&#160;

Under its agreements with Corning Cables Systems LLC, Cables Unlimited and Comnet Telecom are permitted to advertise that they are Corning Cables System CAH Connections Gold Program members.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Warranties and Terms 

&#160;

The Company warrants its products to be free from defects in material and workmanship for varying warranty periods, depending upon the product. Products are generally warranted to the dealer for one year, with the dealer responsible for any additional warranty it may make. The RF Connector products are warranted for the useful life of the connectors.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company and industry analysts estimate worldwide sales of interconnect products of approximately $52 billion in 2015. The Company believes that the worldwide industry for interconnect products and systems is highly fragmented, with no one competitor having over a 20% share of the total market. Many of the competitors of the Connector and Cable Assembly Division have significantly greater financial resources and broader product lines. The Connector and Cable Assembly Division competed on the basis of product quality, product availability, price, service, delivery time and value-added support to its distributors and OEM customers. Since the Company&#8217;s strategy is to provide a broad selection of products in the areas in which it competes and to have a ready supply of those products available at all times, the Company normally carries a significant amount of inventory of its connector products.

&#160;

The Bioconnect division competes with numerous other companies in all areas of its operations, including the manufacture of OEM custom products and medical cable products. Most of the competitors of Bioconnect are larger and have significantly greater financial resources than Bioconnect.

&#160;

Cables Unlimited competes on the basis of product quality, custom design, service, delivery time and value-added support to its customers. Since Cables Unlimited is a Corning Cables System CAH Connections Gold Program member, it is one of 12 other companies permitted to manufacture fiber optic cable assemblies that are backed by Corning Cables Systems&#8217; extended warranty. Cables Unlimited believes that being one of only a dozen Corning Cables System CAH Connections Gold Program members provides it with a competitive advantage in certain fiber optic markets.

&#160;

Comnet Telecom and Rel-Tech Electronics compete with both smaller, local cable assembly houses as well as large, national manufacturers and distributors of telecommunications equipment and products.

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s products are designed to meet all known existing or proposed governmental regulations. Management believes that the Company currently meets existing standards for approvals by government regulatory agencies for its principal products.

&#160;

Bioconnect products are subject to the regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s products are Restriction on Hazardous Substances (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;) compliant.
