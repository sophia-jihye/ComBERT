 Item 1. Description of Business 

&#160;

Organization 

&#160;

HealthTalk Live, Inc. (The Company), is a Nevada Corporation formed on April 1, 2011 by its founders, Johnie M. Yawn and Vicki L. Yawn. The principal executive office is located at 1955 Baring Blvd, Sparks, NV 89434. Telephone: 775-358-1412.

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Our business provides traditional, plus natural health and wellness information services through our real-time interactive website, HealthTalkLive.com, and through our Live Radio Show on WTGF FM distributed through BRN and other affiliate radio stations. For the most part, the affiliate radio stations will be an additional source of revenue, web traffic and advertising. Users of our site have access to information on traditional and natural methods of health care and how to employ those methods, either alone or as a compliment modern medical treatment. HealthTalkLive.com is an Integrative health site.

&#160;

On November 2, 2014 HealthTalk Live Inc., entered into a long term continuing agreement with WTGF FM to distribute the live call-in radio show, Health Talk Live, on 90.1 FM Saturdays 1-2 PM Eastern, starting November 6, 2014. The show is also being streamed live worldwide and available for simultaneous affiliate radio station rebroadcast by either direct satellite connection or broadcast quality Computer Modem (CM). Affiliate stations may also download the show by file transfer protocol (FTP) for replay during a different time slot. As a result of this agreement and our now having a radio outlet for our content, HealthTalk Live, Inc. anticipates revenue to increase and, although it is still too early to accurately predict.

&#160;

On our site, information is disseminated through the live chat forum, reference center, news E-newsletters, Health Tools, Medical Videos.

&#160;

The type of information disseminated through the web site is highly customizable to the user's inputs. The information distributed comes from Health Guides and personal Health Calculators that are widely available in Health and Medical Journals. In some cases, the "forum" or open "blog" will answer individual questions. These questions are answered by various users of the site and are not validated or endorsed by the company. All statements are the opinion of Company and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. The information disseminated on the radio show is live in real time although the stream is delayed 8 seconds. Affiliate stations may rebroadcast our show in any time slot they wish, any show replayed in any time slot other than live is considered a delayed broadcast.

&#160;

The Company's advice for wellness includes integrative medicine. The National Institute of Health defines Integrative Medicine as the combination of conventional medicine with Complementary and Alternative Medicine for which there is evidence of safety and effectiveness. Integrative Medicine is designated to treat the person and not just the disease. This approach depends on a partnership between the patient and the doctor, where the goal is to treat the mind, body, and spirit all at the same time. The Company believes that through integration, more time and attention can be spent on a broader approach to healing, and is not based entirely on Western Medical thought. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), part of the National Institute of Health (nih.gov) changed its name to theNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) effective January 1, 2015.

&#160;

The business plan calls for revenues to be generated through individual monthly subscriptions, affiliate radio stations and advertising on the web-portal. As of the current date, the company has entered into agreements with outside vendors for additional services regarding advertising or revenue sharing. Individual monthly subscriptions will eventually be phased out as advertising and affiliate station revenue increases. HealthTalk Live is no longer actively pursuing Platinum Members; although Platinum members can and do continue to enroll. &#160;

&#160; 4

&#160; 

&#160; As of the date of this quarterly filing, we have generated minimal revenues. However, we have done all the necessary work to have our registration statement declared effective by the SEC on October 17, 2013 and have obtained and OTC Market trading symbol of HLTK.

&#160;

Consumer Services 

&#160;

Our goal is to provide an objective and trusted source of information for online services to support consumers in their efforts to employ educated natural, traditional or integrative techniques into their healthcare and lifestyle choices. We believe that our services and resources will appeal to both patients and doctors who want reliable, up-to-date content and advice on integrative medical techniques.

&#160;

At this time our services are primarily member-based. Silver member users can read and posts in the Live Chat Forum, News, receive E-newsletters, read many of the publications in the Reference Center and have access to Health Tools and Videos. However, in order to post in the Live Chat Forum, read all publications in the Reference Center and access all of the Health Tools and Videos, paid memberships are required.

&#160;

Community-based Discussion Groups 

&#160;

HealthTalkLive.com provides a discussion area called the Live Chat Forum. Currently, the Live Chat Forum allows HealthTalkLive.com members and medical professionals to communicate 24 hours a day and seven days a week, by posting questions, answers, comments and concerns about physical, mental and even spiritual wellbeing. The site provides users the opportunity for its members to ask questions and receive suggestions from naturopathic health specialists about their health concerns. Medical professionals currently providing answers and information include MDs, PhDs, NDs, dieticians and others in the field of natural health, all of whom donate their time as part of their personal or professional commitments to encouraging individuals to make healthier choices.

&#160;

We have a social networking component to our website in that the website also allows each member to create a profile, share information about themselves with other members, to communicate between one another privately and receiving notices when a member flags topics of particular interest when additional posts are created under flagged topics. HealthTalk Live also has an active FaceBook page and Twitter account.

&#160;

Our Reference Center is a continuously growing library of articles compiled from various sources ranging from Health Talk Live staff to articles published elsewhere and used with author permission. All articles relate to health topics related to integrative medicine, modern medical techniques and traditional and holistic health care.

&#160;

Articles in our Reference Center are made available according to membership status. Articles reserved for paid members include all articles created by HealthTalk staff and by medical professionals writing for our website. Articles written by Health Talk staff include references to support data but have not been peer reviewed.

&#160;

The Reference Center also includes articles from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) or other government agencies, which are available free to all users. Articles written by medical professionals published elsewhere and included in our reference center with author permission are free to all.

&#160;

The source and arrangements for which we receive our reference material in our library and whether we purchase or license these materials from other sources, or whether they are copyrighted or available via public domain is as follows: The two officers/founding members have over 12 years each of practical experience and knowledge in the integrative health products industry after having owned/operated a health food store and while guests, hosts, and guest-hosts, on various radio and television programs about integrative health, during that time. Johnie M. Yawn's Ph.D. is in Psychology; Vicki L. Yawn is currently working toward her ND after working in the health insurance industry for well over a decade.

&#160;

All material in the NEWS section is public domain regardless of whether it is authored by us or obtained from the National Institute of Health or Natural Standards, all material from Natural Standards is licensed to us on an annual basis. &#160;

&#160; 5

&#160; 

&#160; Some material in the Reference center is for platinum members however we do not stop its distribution.

&#160;

For over 15 years, Johnie and Vicki have amassed a large library of health references and engaged in conversations, both personally and through radio and television venues, of and with various published professionals, including, but not limited to, the Drs. Balch, Earl Mindell, R.P.H., Ph.D., Eugene Steiner, R.P.H., Ph.D., Sherry Rogers, MD, Helen Pensanti, MD, John Young, MD, Lorna Walker, Ph.D. Nutritionist, Patrick Quillin, PhD., RD, CNS, Ann McCombs, MD, Leigh Erin Connealy, MD, etc., many of whom post regularly in the Live Chat Forum or create and offer articles for the Reference Center at HealthTalkLive.com. Most remain in private practice. Some are retired or semi-retired and devote some of their time helping people through our website by making suggestions for changes people can make to enhance their health. All the MD's referenced are members of the AMA.

&#160;

With respect to our arrangements with doctors and other medical professionals that provide advice through our website and whether we compensate them, offer them services, or we verify their credentials and identities: Most of the medical professionals who post or provide articles through our website are friends and colleagues for well over a decade. They donate some of their time to help people get healthy. All the MD's are members of the AMA.

&#160;

They volunteer on numerous (past) radio and television programs as guests, and will continue to donate time to other radio and television programs, and continue to post suggestions from time to time in the Live Chat Forum, and submit articles for our visitors and members to read in the Reference Center.

&#160;

There is no "arrangement" with any of the professionals who post in the Live Chat Forum, or who submit articles for publication in our Reference Center. We have personally looked up all of the contributors on the internet including their own web pages and professional affiliations. Most have extensive backgrounds such as Dr Helen Pensanti who hosted the TV series Doctor to Doctor for over 20 years.

&#160;

Anyone who writes articles for submission to the site must do so through us; however, most of them are doctors and nutritionists whom we know and have been associated with professionally for years.

&#160;

of procedures performed by surgeons in hospitals that can help outline what a potential surgery is likely to entail, should they decide to have any surgical procedure.

&#160;

We have a licensing agreement with HealthTools that gives us access to their tools for our users. This agreement is renewed on a yearly basis and costs $950.00 per year.

&#160;

We currently have an oral agreement with the president of ORlive. This relationship and agreement developed from the volume of traffic our site generates for ORlive. As part of this oral agreement ORlive built a customized, branded player for our company. All ORlive content exists on their servers with a backup of all content on our servers. Content on ORlive is licensed to ORlive by various hospitals.

&#160;

Discounts on Products 

&#160;

We do not sell products. However, paid Platinum Members of HealthTalkLive.com are eligible for discounts from participating discount providers. The discount is applied when the member purchases suggested supplements directly from the participating providers. Each Participating Discount Provider receives a list of current Platinum Members in order to track Platinum Membership status. At the current time a financial agreement between HealthTalk Live, Inc and Advanced Nutrition exists for commissions based on total sales. We believe that each discount provider currently participates due to the volume of traffic they receive from advertisements they place on our website. We have made each provider aware that in the future they will need to pay for continued presence on our website. There is no guarantee that any of these discount providers will continue to provide discounts or even advertise on our site if they are made to pay fees to do so in the future.

&#160;

Set forth below is a list of our current participating discount providers. &#160;

Customers 

&#160;

We believe our customers are people interested in pursuing or maintaining health naturally, through diet, exercise and other natural or traditional health regimens. Our goal is to provide information and services related to preventative and other health measures to individuals and professionals who choose a more natural and proactive health regimen. At the current time our user demographic consists primarily of adults 35 + years of age.

&#160;

Technological Infrastructure 

&#160;

The Company's Internet-based services are currently delivered through HealthTalkLive.com and are designed to address the healthcare information needs of consumers with easy-to-use interfaces, search functions and navigation capabilities. Certain features of the current website were created only for HealthTalkLive.com by WebFX; however, there are also some programs and plug-ins purchased or downloaded to implement the initial existing website, including Magic Members, Word Press, Buddy Press, Natural Standard, ORLive, Genesis php and Mail Studio, which are all owned by most of these companies, who sell a license to HealthTalkLive.com to use their products, which are renewed yearly.

&#160;

Unfortunately, with our growth, pre-manufactured programs are now failing to meet the needs of the company. In the next 12 months we anticipate hiring additional programmers and developers who will code and create proprietary programs and features that will be owned, operated and featured only at HealthTalkLive.com. We will use customized content management and publishing technology to develop, edit, publish, manage and organize the content for HealthTalkLive.com. To the extent possible we will include industry standard ad-serving technology such as cookies to store, manage and serve online advertisements in a contextually relevant manner.

&#160;

We will soon allow users to create their own forums on a health topic of concern to them. Within these forums users will be able to discuss the health topics with each other's and with health professionals. We have invested, and intend to further invest in the future, in software and systems that allow us to meet the growing demands of our users and sponsors. We anticipate launching a new website within four to six months after hiring new developers and programmers. We anticipate costs for this stage of development to approach $750,000 to $1,000,000. This information is included as "Hiring Symposium" in the milestone chart above. If we do not raise sufficient funds from going public we will not be able to hire new programmers and developers and launch of the new site will be significantly delayed or impossible. &#160;

&#160; 7

&#160; 

&#160; Marketing 

&#160;

Currently, marketing is done through radio, E-newsletters and other media; however, this will be expanded heavily within the year after going public. We anticipate spending $125,000, if and to the extent available as described above, on Search engine optimization (SEO). SEO will allow us to increase the visibility of our site in a search engine's "natural" search results. To increase our marketing we will focus on SEO in order to determine what information people interested in integrative medical techniques or natural health care search for, including the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines by potential users of our site. Optimizing our website may involve editing our content, HTML and associated coding to increase the incidence of commonly searched terms and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We currently have no intellectual property.

&#160;

Regulations 

&#160;

Healthcare Regulation . The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. Most of our revenue is derived either directly from the healthcare industry or from other sources that are subject to healthcare laws and related regulations and could be affected by changes in those laws and regulations. This section of our Annual Report contains a description of healthcare laws and regulations applicable to us, either directly or through their effect on our healthcare industry customers, as well as healthcare industry standards that serve a self-regulatory function, and certain related matters. Changes in those laws, regulations and standards may create unexpected liabilities for us, may cause us to incur additional costs and may restrict our operations.

&#160;

Many healthcare laws are complex, and their application to specific products and services may not be clear. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the healthcare information services that we provide. However, these laws, regulations and industry standards may nonetheless be applied to our products and services. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately anticipate the application of these laws, regulations and industry standards to our operations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our operations, or other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business. Even in areas where we are not subject to healthcare regulation directly, we may become involved in governmental actions or investigations through our relationships with customers that are regulated, and participation in such actions or investigations, even if we are not a party and not the subject of an investigation, may cause us to incur significant expenses.

&#160;

Other Applicable Regulation . This section of our Annual Report also contains a description of other laws and regulations, including general consumer protection laws and Internet-related laws that may affect our operations. Laws and regulations have been adopted, and may be adopted in the future, that address Internet-related issues, including online content, privacy, online marketing, unsolicited commercial email, taxation, pricing, and quality of products and services. Some of these laws and regulations, particularly those that relate specifically to the Internet, were adopted relatively recently, and their scope and application may still be subject to uncertainties. Interpretations of these laws, as well as any new or revised laws or regulations, could decrease demand for our services, increase our cost of doing business, or otherwise cause our business to suffer. &#160;

&#160; 8

&#160; 

&#160; Regulation of Drug and Medical Device Advertising and Promotion 

&#160;

The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulate the form, content and dissemination of labeling, advertising and promotional materials prepared by, or for, pharmaceutical or medical device companies. The FTC regulates over-the-counter drug advertising and, in some cases, medical device advertising. Based on FDA requirements, regulated companies must limit advertising and promotional materials to discussions of FDA-approved uses and claims. In limited circumstances, regulated companies may disseminate certain non-promotional scientific information or disease-state information.

&#160;

Information on our Websites that promotes the use of pharmaceutical products or medical devices is subject to FDA and FTC requirements and enforcement actions, and information regarding other products and services is subject to FTC requirements. If either agency finds that information on our Websites violates regulations or guidance, it may take regulatory or judicial action against us or the advertiser or sponsor of that information. State attorneys general may also take similar action based on their state's consumer protection statutes. Areas of our Websites that could be the primary focus of regulators include pages and programs that discuss use of a regulated product or that the regulators believe may lack editorial independence from the influence of sponsoring pharmaceutical or device companies. Television broadcast advertisements that we may provide may also be subject to FTC and FDA regulation, depending on the content. The agencies place the principal burden of compliance with advertising and promotional regulations on advertisers and sponsors to make truthful, substantiated claims.

&#160;

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations require that prescription drugs be approved by the FDA prior to marketing. It is a violation to market, advertise or otherwise commercialize such products prior to approval. The FDA allows for preapproval exchange of scientific information, provided it is non-promotional in nature and does not draw conclusions regarding the ultimate safety or effectiveness of the unapproved drug. The FDA also refrains from regulating certain disease state materials so long as those materials do not make a representation or suggestion about a drug or device. Upon approval or clearance, the FDA's regulatory authority extends to the labeling and advertising of prescription drugs and medical devices. Such products may be promoted and advertised only for uses reviewed and approved by the FDA. Labeling and advertising can be neither false nor misleading and must present all material information, including risk information, in a clear, conspicuous and neutral manner. There are also requirements for certain information (the "prescribing information" or "package insert" for promotional labeling and the "brief summary" for advertising) to be part of labeling and advertising. Labeling and advertising that violate these legal standards are subject to enforcement.

&#160;

The FDA also regulates the safety, effectiveness, and labeling of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs either through specific product approvals or through regulations that define approved claims for specific categories of products. The FTC regulates the advertising of OTC drugs under the section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive trade practices. The FDA and FTC regulatory framework requires that OTC drugs be formulated and labeled in accordance with FDA approvals or regulations and promoted in a manner that is truthful, adequately substantiated, and consistent with the labeled uses. OTC drugs that do not meet these requirements are subject to FDA or FTC enforcement action depending on the nature of the violation. In addition, state attorneys general may bring enforcement actions for alleged unfair or deceptive advertising.

&#160;

There are several administrative, civil and criminal sanctions available to the FDA for violations of the FDC Act or FDA regulations as they relate to labeling and advertising. Administrative sanctions include a written request that violative advertising or promotion cease and/or that corrective action be taken, such as requiring a company to provide to healthcare providers and/or consumers information to correct misinformation previously conveyed. More serious civil sanctions include seizures, injunctions, fines and consent decrees. Any of these enforcement measures could prevent a company from introducing or maintaining its product in the marketplace. Criminal penalties for severe violations can result in a prison term and/or substantial fines. State attorneys general have similar investigative tools and sanctions available to them.

&#160;

In the last 15 years, the FDA has gradually relaxed its formerly restrictive policies on DTC advertising of prescription drugs, allowing companies to advertise prescription drugs to consumers in any medium, provided that they satisfy FDA requirements. In 2010, the FDA issued a proposed rule recommending standards for determining whether the major statement in DTC advertisements of prescription drugs relating to side effects and contraindications is presented in a clear, conspicuous, and neutral manner. These new regulations, if finalized, could make it more difficult for us to obtain advertising and sponsorship revenue.

&#160;

In 2009, the FDA solicited input on the issue of promoting FDA-regulated products using the Internet and social media. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) directs the FDA to issue guidance, no later than July 9, 2014, regarding the use of the Internet to promote FDA-regulated medical products. There is a possibility that the FDA may issue a policy restricting or materially changing promotion using the Internet, social media and other sponsored health content on the Internet. We cannot predict what effect any such changes would have on our business. Although the FDA issued a 2011 guidance addressing the use of social media by consumers, it was limited to guidance regarding drug and device firms' responses to public unsolicited requests for information made on Websites. &#160;

&#160; 9

&#160; 

&#160; Other Restrictions Regarding Confidentiality, Privacy and Security of Health Information 

&#160;

In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health and prescriber information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. In some cases, more protective state privacy and security laws are not preempted by the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our customers and strategic partners.

&#160;

These laws at a state or federal level, or new interpretations of these laws, could create liability for us, could impose additional operational requirements on our business and could affect the manner in which we use and transmit patient information and could increase our cost of doing business. Claims of violations of privacy rights or contractual breaches, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.

&#160;

Consumer Protection Regulation 

&#160;

General. Advertising and promotional activities presented to visitors on our Websites are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. We are also subject to various other federal and state consumer protection laws, including the specific ones described later in this section.

&#160;

The FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to require that the online collection, use and dissemination of data, and the presentation of Website content, comply with certain standards for notice, choice, security and access. Courts may also adopt these developing standards. In many cases, the specific limitations imposed by these standards are subject to interpretation by courts and other governmental authorities. We believe that we are in compliance with the consumer protection standards that apply to our Websites, but a determination by a state or federal agency or court that any of our practices do not meet these standards could result in liability and adversely affect our business. New interpretations of these standards could also require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. In addition, claims that we are violating any such standards could, even if we are not found liable, be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.

&#160;

In February 2009, the FTC published Self Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising to address consumer privacy issues that may arise from so-called "behavioral advertising" (i.e., the tracking of online activities) and to encourage industry self-regulation. These principles serve as guidelines to industry. In addition, there is a possibility, supported by certain public statements, that the FTC may revise or eliminate the principles in favor of a more restrictive approach for companies that utilize behavioral advertising. There is also a possibility of legislation, regulations and increased enforcement activities, relating to behavioral advertising. To the extent that our existing practices are inconsistent with any revised principles, new rules, new legislation and/or future enforcement activities, our business may become subject to restrictions that could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of doing business.

&#160;

In October 2009, the FTC adopted revised Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. These Guides, which were last updated in 1980, became effective December 1, 2009. In addition to revising certain provisions regarding disclosures relating to endorsements and testimonials, the FTC clarified the Guides' applicability to online and social media forums. The revised Guides may be an indication that the FTC may apply increased scrutiny to the use of endorsements and testimonials online and through traditional media. To the extent we rely on endorsements or testimonials, we will review any relevant relationships for compliance with the Guides. &#160;

&#160; 10

&#160; 

&#160; In December 2010, following a series of workshops, the FTC issued a preliminary staff report containing a proposed framework for businesses and policymakers for online consumer privacy issues and, in March 2012, the FTC issued a final report setting forth its current views on best practices, to protect the privacy of consumers, to be implemented by companies that collect and use consumer data. Also in March 2012, the White House released a Privacy White Paper that outlined the Obama Administration's proposal for a new American privacy framework based on a Consumer Bill of Privacy Rights and which called for the development of industry-specific voluntary, enforceable privacy codes of conduct through a collaborative multi-stakeholder process. Both the FTC and the White House called for Congress to develop baseline privacy legislation and the FTC also called on industry to accelerate the pace of self-regulation.

&#160;

Both the FTC's staff report and the White House's Privacy White Paper reflect a continuing governmental interest in, and assessment of, online privacy issues. How these issues are ultimately resolved, whether through self-regulatory programs, legislation and regulation or some combination and the specifics of any such regimes, may significantly impact our operations.

&#160;

Data Protection Regulation. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. Generally, these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. The FTC has also prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. These laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all consumer data and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of this data.

&#160;

CAN-SPAM Act. On January 1, 2004, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act, became effective. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates commercial emails, provides a right on the part of the recipient to request the sender to stop sending messages, and establishes penalties for the sending of email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Under the CAN-SPAM Act, senders of commercial emails (and other persons who initiate those emails) are required to make sure that those emails do not contain false or misleading transmission information. Commercial emails are required to include a valid return email address and other subject heading information so that the sender and the Internet location from which the message has been sent are accurately identified. Recipients must be furnished with an electronic method of informing the sender of the recipient's decision to not receive further commercial emails. In addition, the email must include a postal address of the sender and notice that the email is an advertisement. We are following the CAN-SPAM requirements in the e-newsletters that WE distribute to members and some of our other email communications, and believe that our email practices comply with the requirements of the CAN-SPAM Act, even though we believe that FTC regulations issued in May 2008 confirmed our existing understanding that these email newsletter communications are not generally commercial emails. Many states have also enacted anti-spam laws. The CAN-SPAM Act preempts many of these statutes. To the extent that these laws are not preempted, we believe that our email practices are designed to comply with these laws.

&#160;

COPPA. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, applies to operators of commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal information from children, and to operators of general audience sites with actual knowledge that they are collecting information from U.S. children under the age of 13. Our sites are not directed at children and our privacy policy, states that no one under the applicable age is entitled to use the site. Our privacy policy specifically states that HealthTalk Live is a general audience site that is not targeted to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18 years of age. We believe this efforts to comply with COPPA are sufficient given the fact that our user demographic consists primarily of adults 35-50 years of age. &#160;

&#160; 11

&#160; 

&#160; FACTA. In an effort to reduce the risk of identity theft from the improper disposal of consumer information, Congress passed the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (or FACTA), which requires businesses to take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to such information. FACTA's disposal standards are flexible and allow businesses discretion in determining what measures are reasonable based upon the sensitivity of the information, the costs and benefits of different disposal methods and relevant changes in technology. We believe that we are in compliance with FACTA.

&#160;

Regulation of Wellness Incentive Programs 

&#160;

Certain provisions of HIPAA (commonly referred to as the HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions) generally prohibit group health plans from charging similarly situated individuals different premiums or contributions or imposing different deductible, co-payment, or other cost-sharing requirements based on a "health factor." Such differentials are, however, acceptable under the HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions if the differentials are applied through "wellness programs." The Department of Labor, in coordination with the Departments of the Treasury and HHS, has issued regulations that define "wellness programs" for purposes of the HIPAA nondiscrimination provisions, establishing specific requirements for wellness programs that reward participants who satisfy a standard related to a health factor. These requirements include (1) limiting the amount of the wellness program's rewards, (2) the wellness program being designed to promote good health and prevent disease, (3) giving those eligible to participate in the wellness program the opportunity to qualify for the reward at least once a year, (4) providing a reward that is available to all similarly situated individuals, and (5) requiring disclosure of reasonable alternative standards that must be available under the wellness program.

&#160;

Although HIPAA and its regulations state that certain excepted benefits, including supplemental benefits, are not subject to the wellness program rules, it does not define the term "similar supplemental coverage." On December 7, 2007, the Department of Labor, in coordination with the Departments of the Treasury and HHS, released Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2007-04 (FAB 2007-04) in response to the development of questionable health and wellness programs that were marketed as "similar supplemental coverage." FAB 2007-04 clarifies the rules for supplemental programs and provides that supplemental benefits under a wellness program cannot discriminate on the basis of a health factor. With these new requirements in place, wellness programs that require individuals to meet certain health factors can no longer be considered supplemental and thus have to comply with HIPAA wellness program regulations described in the immediately preceding paragraph. According to FAB 2007-04, programs that do not meet these requirements may be subject to enforcement actions. HHS provided parallel guidance in Program Memorandum 08-01 (May 2008).

&#160;

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of an employee's disability or perceived disability. Among other things, it limits employers from inquiring about the disabilities of employees unless the questions are job-related and consistent with business necessity. The ADA also limits the circumstances in which an employer may require physical examinations or answers to medical inquiries. However, the ADA allows employers to conduct voluntary medical examinations and activities, including voluntary medical histories, as part of a voluntary wellness program. A wellness program is "voluntary" if the employer neither requires participation nor penalizes employees who do not participate. Records acquired as part of a wellness program must be kept confidential and may not be used for a discriminatory purpose. Many states and localities provide similar protections to employees.

&#160;

The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act restricts the collection or use of genetic information for underwriting purposes, and treats the offering of incentives or disincentives for completing an HRA or participating in a wellness program as underwriting. See "&#8212; Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)," above.

&#160;

We provide certain services related to wellness programs in connection with our site. We believe that we are in compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to these services, to the extent they apply to us.

&#160;

Medical Professional Regulation 

&#160;

The practice of most healthcare professions requires licensing under applicable state law. In addition, the laws in some states prohibit business entities from practicing medicine, which is referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. We do not believe that we engage in the practice of medicine, and we have attempted to structure our Website, strategic relationships and other operations to avoid violating these state licensing and professional practice laws. We do not believe that we provide professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. We employ and contract with physicians who provide only health information to consumers, and we have no intention to provide medical care or advice. A state, however, may determine that some portion of our business violates these laws and may seek to have us discontinue those portions or subject us to penalties or licensure requirements. Any determination that we are a healthcare provider and acted improperly as a healthcare provider may result in liability to us. Specifically, we post the following disclaimer on our site: All statements are the opinion of staff at HealthTalkLive.com and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.

&#160; 

&#160; Healthcare Reform 

&#160;

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (which we refer to as the Reform Legislation), was signed into law in March 2010. The Reform Legislation makes extensive changes to the system of healthcare insurance and benefits in the U.S. In general, the Reform Legislation seeks to reduce healthcare costs and decrease the number of uninsured legal U.S. residents by, among other things, requiring individuals to carry, and certain employers to offer, health insurance or be subject to penalties. The Reform Legislation also imposes new regulations on health insurers, including guaranteed coverage requirements, prohibitions on certain annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to plan members, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum medical loss ratio requirements, a requirement to cover certain preventive services on a first dollar basis, the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages, and greater limitations on how health insurers price certain of their products. The Reform Legislation also contains provisions that will affect the revenues and profits of pharmaceutical and medical device companies, including new taxes on certain sales of their products.

&#160;

Many of the provisions of the Reform Legislation that expand insurance coverage will not become effective until 2014, and many provisions require regulations and interpretive guidance to be issued before they will be fully implemented. Some provisions do not apply to health plans that were in place when the Reform Legislation was enacted and have not been substantially changed since. In addition, it is difficult to foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the choices available to them under the Reform Legislation. Furthermore, the Reform Legislation will result in future state legislative and regulatory changes, which we are unable to predict at this time, in order for states to comply with certain provisions of the Reform Legislation and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities. In addition, Congress is considering various proposals to repeal some or all of the Reform Legislation.

&#160;

While we do not currently anticipate any significant adverse effects on us as a direct result of application of the Reform Legislation to our business or on our company in its capacity as an employer, we are unable to predict what the indirect impacts of the Reform Legislation will be on our business through its effects on other healthcare industry participants, including pharmaceutical and medical device companies that are advertisers and sponsors of our public portals and employers and health plans that are clients of our private portals. Healthcare industry participants may respond to the Reform Legislation or to uncertainties created by the Reform Legislation by reducing their expenditures or postponing expenditure decisions, including expenditures for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

However, we believe that certain aspects of the Reform Legislation and future implementing regulations that seek to reduce healthcare costs may create opportunities for us with respect to our capabilities in providing health and wellness information and education. For example, the Reform Legislation encourages use of wellness programs through grants to small employers to establish such programs, permission for employers to offer larger rewards than under prior law, in the form of waivers of cost-sharing, premium discounts, or additional benefits, to employees for participating in these programs and meeting certain standards, and the inclusion of wellness services and chronic disease management among the essential health benefits that certain plans are required to provide. In addition, we believe that, as the Reform Legislation is implemented and consumers begin shopping for health insurance in the new markets that it creates, we will be well positioned to provide information and decision-support tools to assist consumers in choosing an appropriate health plan for their needs. However, we cannot yet determine the scope of any such opportunities or what competition we may face in our efforts to pursue such opportunities.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Competition in the healthcare information and services industry is intense. We will face direct competition with other online services and websites, including blogs providing information about traditional and naturopathic health care and products, other small websites providing such information, as well as from subsidiaries or other affiliates of larger health information and services websites, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do. We will initially be a small competitor in the market. &#160;

&#160; 13

&#160; 

&#160; Our principal larger competitors will be websites such as WebMD, Yahoo.com and About.com and other websites that provide general-purpose consumer online services, as well as other high-traffic websites that include healthcare-related and non-healthcare-related content and services. Our competitors also include more specialized providers of online services, tools and applications for healthcare consumers, such as iVillage.com, DrKoop.com, drugs.com, eMedicine.com and Realage.com. We also face competition from governmental and non-profit sites, such as NIH.com and medline.com. We intend to compete with these larger competitors by offering more comprehensive services and information. We believe that users of our website will find all of the information they seek by visiting our website rather than needing to visit multiple sites to find similarly comprehensive information.

&#160;

Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and some are better known than we are. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations. As a result these competitors may:

&#160;

-

Succeed in providing information and services that are equal to or superior to our information and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our information and service;

-

Devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their products; 

-

Respond more quickly to new or emerging information or service technologies, which could render our information and services obsolete or less preferable; 

-

Withstand competition in the industry more effectively than we can.

-

Establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our customers or prospective customers; and 

-

Take advantage of other opportunities more readily than we can.

&#160;

Since there are no substantial barriers to entry into the markets in which we participate, we expect that additional competitors will continue to enter these markets.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

Our only full time employees are Johnie Yawn and Vicki Yawn. They are the founders of our company and perform all clerical, administrative, managerial and sales functions at the present time. We also utilize 5-10 part time workers as independent contractors who work on our website as programmers and developers as needed.

&#160;
