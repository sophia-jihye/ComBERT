Corporate History 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

The Company focused on the development, exploration and production of oil and gas in North America. Our primary focus is on oil and gas properties with proven undeveloped reserves that are economically attractive but are underserved by major independent oil and gas companies.

&#160; 

Garcia #3 Well 

&#160; 

On May 23, 2013, we acquired a ten percent working interest, seven point five percent net revenue interest, from a third party interest holder of the Garcia #3 well (10.0 % WI, 7.5% NRI). For our interest, we paid $300,000 in convertible preferred shares with a conversion rate of .01 per share.

&#160;

We are subject to the terms and conditions of the operating agreement established by the operator for the Garcia#3 well, Kidd Production Inc., the property developer, Progas Energy Services and the third party vendor we acquired our 10% interest from.

&#160;

In August of 2013 Scorpion Rig #1 was moved onto the Garcia #3 location. The rig drilled to a total depth of 3750 feet with oil shows in the Frio Sands. Pipe was cemented in place and the drilling rig was released. In October, a work-over unit was moved in to test the target zones. The lower zones were tested and found to contain natural gas with water produced from the zone. The decision was made to move up the well and test an oil bearing zone. This zone was determined to be tight and requiring fracking to accurately determine the potential production of this zone. The Company was not in agreement with Progas regarding the value of the fracking on this zone and we are waiting on information back from Progas regarding the fracking and any results. Progas continues to be challenging to work with.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Due to our minority interest in the Garcia#3 well, we are reviewing operational alternatives to resolve our inability to control the development of this well and the field in general for any future drilling activities. The Company continues to evaluate leases available in the same area as the Premont Field, which may be available for the Company to lease directly from the mineral rights owners.

&#160;

The Company has made the determination that due to the operator in control of the Garcia #3 that it will not continue to participate in this project. Other leasable property in the area is not close enough to production to justify the risk of investment. The Company will not be active in this area.

&#160;

Joaquin Basin Resources, Inc. 

&#160; 

Effective January 20, 2011, we entered into a Shared Exchange Agreement with Joaquin Basin Resources Inc., a Nevada corporation, and its stockholders (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, we agreed to issue to Joaquin Basin shareholders (i) 62,000,000 shares of our common stock and (ii) 2,076,324 shares of our convertible preferred stock, in exchange for the transfer and delivery to us of their 62,000,000 shares of common stock in Joaquin Basin, which represents all of the issued and outstanding shares in Joaquin Basin. As result of the transaction, Joaquin Basin became our wholly owned subsidiary.

&#160;

On November 21, 2011, Joaquin Basin entered into an amendment (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) to its original Asset Transfer Agreement with Xploration, Inc., a Nevada corporation. Pursuant to the Asset Transfer Agreement, Xploration assigned Joaquin Basin a 50% working interest (37.5% net revenue interest) in mineral leases of approximately 4,000 acres in the Kreyenhagen Trend and Joaquin Basin assumed all of the liabilities associated with the leases.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Amendment, in consideration for a reduction in working interest from 50% to 20% and in consideration for a reduction in net revenue interest from 37.5% to 14%, Xploration will do the following as increased compensation to Joaquin:

&#160;

The total expenses that Xploration paid on behalf of Joaquin associated with the mineral leases will exceed $1,100,000. Joaquin will get a full carry on the first well drilled.

&#160;

The following is a list of the expenses Xploration paid and to be paid on behalf of Joaquin:

&#160;

1. All GG&#38;A, in excess of $300,000 was paid, as determined by Xploration of the leases for the period October 1, 2013 through March 31, 2014. &#160;

2. All lease rentals, were paid in the amount of $284,000, due for the period October 1, 2011 through March 31, 2014. &#160;

3. Pay all expenses through completion of the first well planned to be on a lease preselected by the geological team (but at Xploration&#8217;s election to be drilled on any of the leases), the cost of which is estimated to be in excess of $500,000 (&#8220;First Farmin Well&#8221;), such well anticipated to be commenced during the period in the last quarter of 2014. &#160;

4. In the event Xploration has not commenced drilling the First Farmin Well within the timeframe as referenced in 3 above, then the time period within which Xploration may drill the First Farmin well may be further extended for an additional twelve month period ending September 30, 2014. &#160;

As mentioned above, we issued 2,076,000 shares of convertible preferred stock in concluding the Joaquin Basin purchase agreement. The cost of the issue, $4,152,000, was based on the value of preferred stock as if converted to common stock. $4,152,000 was added to the cost of the Joaquin property, including liabilities assumed in the November 21, 2011 agreement with Xploration Inc.

&#160;

On March 1, 2011, Joaquin Basin entered into an Operating Agreement with Solimar Energy, LLC (&#8220;Solimar&#8221;) to explore and develop the 4,000 leased acres covering extensions of the Coalinga California oil and gas field in California. The acreage is labeled as the Kreyenhagen Trend acreage is on the nose of a Coalinga anticline.

&#160;

In recent months, Solimar Energy as operator has been active on the Kreyenhagen Trend Prospect. Six wells have been submitted to the State of California for permitting. The permits are currently under review by the State of California.

&#160;

Each Drilling permit requires a Blunt Nose Lizard Study (the &#34;Study&#34;) to be conducted once in the spring and once again in the fall. After the Study is finalized, the drilling permits can be issued and the drilling process is expected to start. The Blunt Nose Lizard studies are still underway and upon completion the State of California will finalize the review of the proposed drilling permits.

&#160;

The Geological study was conducted on only the Kreyenhagen Ranch. Solimar Energy has chosen not to share any of the information generated by the survey done on the Ranch. As we are not the operator in the Kreyenhagen Trend acreage the Company is dependent on Solimar Energy as it relates to activity in the Trend acreage. Currently it seems that Solimar is focused on the Ranch properties and not the Trend. Company management is keeping communication open with Solimar in an attempt to have their focus to expand and include the Trend acreage development. 

&#160;

The Companies participation in the Kreyenhagen Ranch was exchanged out in conjunction with the terms of the asset swap agreement dated October 18, 2013.

&#160;

SE Jonah Prospect 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s working interest in the remaining SE Jonah Prospect leases was allowed to expire, as the Company&#8217;s evaluation of the potential investment was conclusive in the following; the large dollars required to develop this field remained far greater than the possible revenue to be generated over an acceptable time frame. Primarily, because of the low selling price of natural gas, which is lower than the overall cost of production, and the lack of an infrastructure to allow full production of natural gas from an existing well, the time frame to develop the required infrastructure is based on the natural gas production to warrant a transportation company committing the funding to build it. Along with a low selling price for the product signifies that the money will not be spent to drill due to the lack of transportation and the transportation will not happed due to the lack of drilling. The Company has decided not to be active in this area.

&#160; &#160; 

Jacolitos Project 

&#160; 

On July 31, 2013, the Company, entered into a Project Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Xploration, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Xploration&#8221;) to acquire a twenty five percent (25%) working interest (WI) and a fourteen percent (14%) net royalty interest (&#8220;NRI&#8221;) in five hundred sixteen (516) acres in the Coalinga California area identified as the Jacolitos Project.

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the Company shall acquire the Jacolitos Project Property through a purchase agreement for a total purchase price of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (the &#8220;Purchase Price&#8221;). This transaction was not completed by the Company.

&#160; 

Asset Swap Agreement 

&#160; 

On October 18, 2013, the Company entered into an Asset Swap Agreement (the &#8220;Asset Swap Agreement&#8221;) by and amongst the Company, Xploration Inc., a Nevada Corporation (&#8220;Xploration&#8221;) and Solimar Energy, LLC, a California limited liability company (&#8220;Solimar&#8221;); thereby, swapping certain land leases as described below, forgiveness of delay rentals and terminating the (a) Kreyenhagen Trend Joint Operating Agreement dated March 1, 2011, between Solimar and Xploration (&#8220;Kreyenhagen Trend JOA&#8221;), (b) Jacalitos Joint Operating Agreement dated March 1, 2011, between Solimar and Xploration (&#8220;Jacalitos JOA&#8221;) and the (c) Farmin / Settlement Agreement dated November 3, 2011, between Solimar and Xploration, with an effective date as of September 1, 2013. 

&#160;

As per the terms of the Asset Swap Agreement, the Company and Xploration assigned sixteen percent (16%) interest to Solimar, in the following six (6) leases located in the Kreyenhagen Trend, instruments numbered: (i) 0922006 2009-0167477, (ii) 2007-0068080, (iii) 1122558, (iv) 801269, (v) 2007-0036755, and (vi) 2007-0036730. Further, as part of this Asset Swap Agreement, the Company and Xploration, assigned the twenty-five percent (25%) interest in the Jacalitos Lease, instrument numbered 2009-167476, for a total assignment of 3,102.43 gross landowner acres and 3,082.43 net landowner acres to Solimar. In return, Solimar assigned eighty four percent (84%) of its interest in the Bureau of Land Management Lease, serial number: CACA 49877 representing 1,140.62 gross and net landowner acres that is a part of the Kreyenhagen Trend to the Xploration and Xploration will be assigning the eighty four (84%) to the Company at a future date.

&#160;

&#160;

Additionally, as part of the Asset Swap Agreement, Solimar shall forgive Xploration and the Company of the Company&#8217;s and Xploration&#8217;s obligation to pay the delay rental on the Vintage Petroleum, LLC, lease on instrument numbered 0922006 2009-0167477, and 2009-0167476 for a total forgiveness of nine thousand nine hundred thirty one dollars and forty nine cents ($9,931.49). In connection with the Asset Swap Agreement, Xploration will pay Solimar three hundred sixty five dollars ($365) for its delay rental on the CACA 49877 lease that became due on August 31, 2013.

&#160;

Competition and Marketing 

&#160; 

We will be faced with strong competition from many other companies and individuals engaged in the oil and gas business, many are very large, well-established energy companies with substantial capabilities and established earnings records. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring oil and gas prospects since we must compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs. It is nearly impossible to estimate the number of competitors; however, it is known that there are a large number of companies and individuals in the oil and gas business.

&#160;

Exploration for and production of oil and gas are affected by the availability of pipe, casing and other tubular goods and certain other oil field equipment including drilling rigs and tools. We expect we will depend upon independent drilling contractors to furnish rigs, equipment and tools to drill wells. Higher prices for oil and gas may result in competition among operators for drilling equipment, tubular goods and drilling crews, which may affect our ability expeditiously to drill, complete, recomplete and work-over wells.

&#160;

The market for oil and gas is dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control, which at times cannot be accurately predicted. These factors include the proximity of wells to, and the capacity of, natural gas pipelines, the extent of competitive domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the availability of other sources of energy, fluctuations in seasonal supply and demand, and governmental regulation. In addition, there is always the possibility that new legislation may be enacted, which would impose price controls or additional excise taxes upon crude oil or natural gas, or both. Oversupplies of natural gas can be expected to recur from time to time and may result in the gas producing wells being shut-in. Imports of natural gas may adversely affect the market for domestic natural gas.

&#160;

The market price for crude oil is significantly affected by policies adopted by the member nations of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (&#34;OPEC&#34;). Members of OPEC establish prices and production quotas among themselves for petroleum products from time to time with the intent of controlling the current global supply and consequently price levels. We are unable to predict the effect, if any, that OPEC or other countries will have on the amount of, or the prices received for, crude oil and natural gas.

&#160;

Gas prices, which were once effectively determined by government regulations, are now largely influenced by competition. Competitors in this market include producers, gas pipelines and their affiliated marketing companies, independent marketers, and providers of alternate energy supplies, such as residual fuel oil. Changes in government regulations relating to the production, transportation and marketing of natural gas have also resulted in significant changes in the historical marketing patterns of the industry. Generally, these changes have resulted in the abandonment by many pipelines of long-term contracts for the purchase of natural gas, the development by gas producers of their own marketing programs to take advantage of new regulations requiring pipelines to transport gas for regulated fees, and an increasing tendency to rely on short-term contracts priced at spot market prices.

&#160; 

Existing and Probable Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

We intend to monitor and comply with current government regulations that affect our activities, although our operations may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulations or taxation. There can be no assurance we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses and permits that may be required to carry out our exploration and development programs. It is not expected any of these controls or regulations will affect our operations in a manner materially different than they would affect other natural gas and oil companies operating in the areas in which we operate.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The United States federal government and various state and local governments have adopted laws and regulations regarding the protection of human health and the environment. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit by operators before drilling commences, prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness areas, wetlands, or where pollution might cause serious harm, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling operations, particularly with respect to operations in onshore and offshore waters or on submerged lands. These laws and regulations may increase the costs of drilling and operating wells. Because these laws and regulations change frequently, the costs of compliance with existing and future environmental regulations cannot be predicted with certainty.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The transportation and certain sales of natural gas in interstate commerce are heavily regulated by agencies of the federal government. Production of any oil and gas by properties in which we have an interest will be affected to some degree by state regulations. States have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and gas, including provisions regarding deliverability. Such statutes and the regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and gas between owners of a common reservoir.

&#160;

State regulatory authorities may also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or pro-ration unit.

&#160;

Any exploration or production on Federal land will have to comply with the Federal Land Management Planning Act, which has the effect generally of protecting the environment. Any exploration or production on private property whether owned or leased will have to comply with the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The cost of complying with environmental concerns under any of these acts varies on a case-by-case basis. In many instances the cost can be prohibitive to development. Environmental costs associated with a particular project must be factored into the overall cost evaluation of whether to proceed with the project.

&#160;

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, issue regulations, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution. The strict liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon us regardless of fault. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general.

&#160;

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, generally imposes joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, such persons may be subject to strict joint and several liabilities for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; have been released.

&#160;

We did not incur any costs in connection with the compliance with any federal, state, or local environmental laws. However, costs could occur at any time through industrial accident or in connection with a terrorist act or a new project. Costs could extend into the millions of dollars for which we could be totally liable. In the event of liability, we believe we would be entitled to contribution from other owners so that our percentage share of a particular project would be the percentage share of our liability on that project. However, other owners may not be willing or able to share in the cost of the liability. Even if liability were limited to our percentage share, any significant liability would wipe out our assets and resources

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We do not have any employees as of March 31, 2016. As of the date of this filing, we have 4 employees, and 17 suppliers and subcontractors.
