 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

We incorporated as Helen of Troy Corporation in Texas in 1968 and were reorganized as Helen of Troy Limited 

in Bermuda in 1994. We are a global consumer products company offering creative solutions for our customers through a strong portfolio of well-recognized and widely trusted brands. We have built our market positions through new product innovation, product quality and competitive pricing. People around the world use our products every day to help meet their household, health and beauty needs. We have four business segments: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Housewares . Our Housewares segment provides a broad range of innovative consumer products for the home. Product offerings include food preparation tools and appliances, gadgets, storage containers, cleaning, organization, baby and toddler care products. Key brands include OXO, OXO Good Grips, OXO Soft Works, OXO tot, OXO On and OXO SteeL. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Health &#38; Home . The Health &#38; Home segment focuses on healthcare devices such as thermometers, humidifiers, blood pressure monitors, and heating pads; water filtration systems; and small home appliances such as portable heaters, fans, air purifiers, and insect control devices. Key brands include Vicks, Braun, Honeywell, PUR, Febreze, Stinger, Duracraft, and SoftHeat. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Nutritional Supplements . Our Nutritional Supplements segment is a leading provider of premium branded vitamins, minerals and supplements, as well as other health products sold directly to consumers. Key brands include Omega Q Plus Resveratrol, Omega Q Plus, Probiotic Advantage, Vision Essentials, Total Cardio Cover, Joint Advantage Gold&#174;, Triveratrol, Trilane, Berberine+GlucoDefense and OxyRub. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Beauty . Our Beauty segment&#8217;s products include electric hair care, beauty care and wellness appliances; grooming tools and accessories; and liquid-, solid- and powder-based personal care and grooming products. Key brands include Revlon, Sure, Pert Plus, Infusium 23, Brut, Ammens, Hot Tools, Pro Beauty, Bed Head, Karina, Sea Breeze, and Gold &#8216;N Hot. 

&#160; 

The Nutritional Supplements segment sells directly to consumers. Our other segments sell their products primarily through mass merchandisers, drugstore chains, warehouse clubs, catalogs, grocery stores, and specialty stores. In addition, the Beauty segment sells extensively through beauty supply retailers and wholesalers and the Health &#38; Home segment sells certain of its product lines through medical distributors and other products through home improvement stores. We purchase our products from unaffiliated manufacturers, most of which are located in China, Mexico and the United States. 

&#160;

Fiscal Year 2016 Operating Initiatives 

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2016, we made the following progress on key initiatives: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Brand Investment and Growth &#8211; Accelerating our growth was a high priority in fiscal year 2016. We have made significant progress executing the strategic priorities guiding our multi-year transformation, which led to organic sales growth in fiscal year 2016 of almost 3 percent despite foreign currency headwinds of over 2 percent. We made prudent investments in developing and launching new products, go-to-market plans and marketing activities for brands with leading positions or with the potential to grow share. We also intensified our focus on innovation, based on in-depth consumer and competitive research. Examples of progress made within each segment include: 

&#160; 

o 

Housewares . The Housewares segment sales grew almost 5 percent in fiscal year 2016, continuing its track record of strong organic growth. The segment&#8217;s growth was driven by product innovation, category extension, expanded shelf placement, and international growth. Housewares continued to leverage its expertise in innovation, product design and category development. The segment successfully introduced a number of new products including its innovative GreenSaver storage containers, which shipped in the Spring of 2015. GreenSaver, designed to extend the life of fresh produce, has been favorably received and is an example of a product that includes a higher-margin consumable with a repeat purchase cycle. This innovation also illustrates the benefits of increased collaboration across the Company, leveraging Health &#38; Home segment expertise in the use of activated carbon, which is effective in preserving produce. We also launched new OXO On kitchen electrics, which leveraged expertise with electrical appliances in other segments and entered the metal bakeware category with products featuring thoughtful design details. Additionally, Housewares continues to expand existing categories, evidenced by the OXO Hand-Held Spiralizer, which turns vegetables and fruits into colorful salad toppings and a new OXO stainless steel professional cutlery line. 

&#160; 

o 

Health &#38; Home . Our Health &#38; Home business segment grew in fiscal year 2016 despite the impacts of a below average cold and flu season and significant foreign currency headwinds. Health &#38; Home saw organic sales growth of almost 5 percent despite an approximately 3 percent negative foreign currency impact. The segment continued to expand its reach with several new thermometry products under the Braun brand, which were positively received in key markets. Consumer research indicated a desire to track and share temperature readings, so our new Vicks Smart Temp digital stick thermometer uses a smartphone app to connect wirelessly via Bluetooth to track and share temperatures for multiple users within a family. Another example of innovation is our new Vicks Sweet Dreams humidifier, building on the success of the Starry Night humidifier, which projects night scenes to calm parents and sick children as it provides relief from cough and cold symptoms. The segment also introduced a new identity for the PUR brand and is launching new faucet mount and pitcher water filtration systems in the latter half of fiscal year 2017. We believe that water quality has gained increased awareness in the U.S. and our PUR products are category leaders in contaminant removal. Finally, during fiscal year 2016, we acquired fully paid-up licenses of the Vicks VapoSteam inhalants and VapoPad scent pads, which strategically complements our U.S. humidifier and vaporizer business with consumable refills in both the liquid and pad form. The vast majority of Vicks VapoSteam and VapoPads are used in Vicks humidifiers, vaporizers and other health care devices already marketed by the segment. By combining the businesses of devices and consumables, we can give greater marketing focus to the category and invest in additional product development. 

&#160; 

o 

Nutritional Supplements . Our Nutritional Supplements business participates in the premium doctor-branded vitamins, minerals and supplements category using an education and content driven a direct-to-consumer distribution model. The segment is focused on acquiring new consumers through online and direct mail education and marketing, and continues to see significant growth in customer adoption of its continuity program, called AutoDelivery, whereby customers can place an order once that is automatically refilled based upon customer directed timing. The segment continues to work on new product introductions, while supporting its best-selling products from our established base of physicians. New products introduced in fiscal year 2016 include Probiotic Advantage Bifido Beadlets, MK-7 Artery Circulation and Super Healthy Prostate. We are also leveraging the segment&#8217;s ability to add new doctors and additional wellness areas. During the fiscal year we added Dr. Daniel Amen and Dr. Luigi Polla to our team. Dr. Amen is a nationally recognized 

&#160;

brain health expert and NY Times best-selling author and Dr. Polla offers skin care expertise through his Alchimie Forever line from Switzerland. These investments contributed to growth in their respective areas, while others are creating a platform for future growth. During fiscal year 2016, we also completed the warehouse consolidation for Nutritional Supplements, one of our committed cost saving initiatives, which also brought more sophisticated direct-to-consumer fulfillment capabilities in-house. 

&#160; 

o 

Beauty . In fiscal year 2016 we reorganized the Beauty segment to stabilize the business and deliver consumer product innovation in pursuit of promising opportunities. We believe the business showed early signs of stability with organic growth of almost 1 percent in the face of a foreign currency headwind of over 2 percent. The reorganization included a streamlined approach to the retail and professional markets, unifying multiple sales and marketing organizations and key support functions such as finance, creative services and marketing. We added internal and external product design capability and selectively invested in new product development, while employing more efficient brand building by redirecting our marketing support based on quantitative marketing spend analysis. The first set of product and commercial initiatives delivered both innovation and improved marketing. In retail appliances, our new Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Styler, was inspired by women searching for convenience and speed. In professional appliances, stylists indicated that longer appliances would make a difference solving needs around longer hair, so under the Hot Tools professional brand, we launched extra-long versions of our straighteners and curling irons. Additionally, we re-launched our Pro Beauty Tools brand with new products and packaging that we believe appeals to consumers' demand for professional-grade products sold at retail. Finally, we eliminated lower performing products, which should improve our working capital efficiency and provides a platform for profitable growth. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Transforming the Organization &#8211; Our global shared services management structure consists of three shared service groups: Global Finance, Global Operations, and Global Legal, Human Resources and Corporate Communications. We continued to implement new initiatives in connection with this structure, including the establishment of a Global Leadership Council and made improvements in our information technology organization and architecture, which is critical to enabling operating efficiencies and best practices. Throughout fiscal year 2016, we brought new talent into the organization, including the additions of a new Global Human Resources Vice President and Chief Information Officer, and introduced a new compensation program designed to attract, retain and motivate top talent. We are also implementing additional best practices in a variety of areas such as demand planning, sourcing, distribution automation, and efficiency and inventory management. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Shareholder Friendly Policies &#8211; We are committed to acting in the best interests of shareholders. A key facet of our shareholder friendly policies is to leverage the strong cash flow generation of our business to make accretive acquisitions, as well as leverage the organic growth potential of our existing businesses. We effectively used our capital structure to make the Healthy Directions acquisition in June 2014 and the VapoSteam acquisition in March 2015. Shortly after the end of fiscal year 2016, we closed the acquisition of Hydro Flask, a leading designer, distributor and marketer of high performance insulated stainless steel food and beverage containers for active lifestyles. We also returned capital to shareholders by repurchasing $100 million of our common stock on the open market during fiscal year 2016. We will continue to use the strong cash flow generation of our business and the financial flexibility of our balance sheet to invest in our core business, search for accretive acquisitions, and consider return of capital to shareholders. We intend to improve our working capital efficiency through supply chain excellence and product rationalization, which we believe will further strengthen our balance sheet and free additional cash flow for capital transactions that benefit our shareholders. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Fiscal Year 2016 Developments 

&#160; 

&#183; 

On March 31, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Vicks VapoSteam U.S. liquid inhalant business from The Procter &#38; Gamble Company (&#8220;P&#38;G&#8221;), which includes a fully paid-up license of P&#38;G&#8217;s Vicks VapoSteam inhalants. In a related transaction, the Company acquired a fully paid-up U.S. license of P&#38;G&#8217;s Vicks VapoPad scent pads. Our VapoSteam operations are reported in the Health &#38; Home segment. The vast majority of Vicks VapoSteam and VapoPads are used in Vicks humidifiers, vaporizers and other health care devices already marketed by the Company. The aggregate purchase price for the two transactions was approximately $42.75 million financed primarily with borrowings under our credit facility. The VapoSteam acquisition provided incremental net sales revenue of $7.99 million for the eleven months of operations included in fiscal year 2016. The VapoSteam business is highly seasonal with peak sales occurring in our third fiscal quarter. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

In March 2015, we announced the introduction of a premium line of kitchen electrics under the OXO On brand. The initial line consists of motorized toasters, coffee makers, a coffee grinder, an electric kettle, an immersion blender, and a hand mixer. The line shipped initially in the U.S. offering several unique features, as well as thoughtful design elements based on OXO&#8217;s universal design ethos. We believe OXO On appliances will provide the simplicity, functionality, and thoughtfulness consumers have come to expect from the OXO brand. The line began shipments to retail stores in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

In August 2015, we repurchased 556,591 shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $89.93 per share for a total cost of $50 million. In January 2016, we repurchased 570,205 shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $87.69 per share for a total cost of $50 million. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

During fiscal year 2016, we transitioned the Nutritional Supplements order fulfillment operations to our Southaven, Mississippi distribution facility. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

During fiscal year 2016, we consolidated and reorganized our Beauty segment&#8217;s organizational structure, eliminating certain overlapping functions to more efficiently leverage our scale, better focus on consumer-centric innovation and best serve our professional and retail customers. The entire segment is now served by a common shared service structure for marketing, financial and other back-office support. We believe this is a critical step in our efforts to stabilize and ultimately grow the Beauty segment. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

On November 12, 2015, the Company settled a lawsuit with its former CEO, which resulted in the payment of 

severance compensation due under his employment and separation agreements. The severance compensation was previously accrued and disclosed in fiscal year 2014 and was paid through the issuance of common shares of the Company on November 17, 2015. The Company also transferred ownership of a life insurance policy on the lives of its former CEO and his spouse as part of the settlement. As a result of the transfer of the policy and other expenses incurred in connection with the settlement, the Company recorded CEO succession costs of $6.71 million ($4.64 million after tax), or $0.16 per fully diluted share, in fiscal year 2016. 

. 

&#183; 

On January 22, 2016, a jury ruled against the Company in a case that involved claims by Exergen Corporation, headquartered in Watertown, MA. The case alleges patent infringement related to two forehead thermometer models sold by our subsidiary, Kaz USA, Inc., in the United States. Exergen was awarded damages of $14.6 million with respect to a period of approximately seven years of sales. The Company could be liable for payment of royalties on any future sales of the two products. As a result of the jury verdict, the Company recorded a fourth quarter charge, including legal fees and other related expenses, of $17.83 million ($17.79 million after tax). The outcome of the case is not yet final and the Company disagrees with the verdict, which will be subject to several post-trial motions and an appeal. The forehead thermometers involved in this case represent less than 1 percent of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2016. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

During fiscal year 2016, we recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $6.00 million ($5.31 million after tax). The charges relate to a trademark in our Beauty segment, which was written down to its estimated fair value. 

&#160;

&#183; 

As further discussed in Note (2) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and under Item. 7., &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Overview,&#8221; we changed the rate used to re-measure our Venezuelan financial statements as of February 29, 2016 to the SIMADI rate of approximately 205 Bolivars per U.S. Dollar, which was the lowest rate in a three-tiered exchange system in place at the time. Shortly after the end of fiscal year 2016, the Venezuelan government introduced a new rate referred to as DICOM that is intended to be market-based and was initially set at a rate very similar to that of SIMADI. Absent further changes to the exchange systems, or unless future developments call for further changes, we intend to use DICOM to re-measure our financial statements on a go-forward basis. Consolidated net sales revenue includes sales for our operations in Venezuela of $21.97 and $10.31 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating income (loss) in Venezuela was ($9.95) and $2.87 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fiscal year 2016 operating loss includes re-measurement related charges totaling $18.73 million. At the current DICOM exchange rate, we expect that fiscal year 2017 U.S. Dollar reported net sales and operating income from Venezuela will no longer be meaningful to our consolidated and Beauty segment results. 

&#160; 

Recent Development 

&#160; 

On March 18, 2016, the Company acquired Steel Technology, LLC, doing business as Hydro Flask (&#8220;Hydro Flask&#8221;). Hydro Flask is a leading designer, distributor and marketer of high performance insulated stainless steel food and beverage containers for active lifestyles. Hydro Flask adds a fast growing brand that has built equity among outdoor and active lifestyle enthusiasts with a product lineup, innovation pipeline and margin profile that complements, and will operate in, our Housewares segment. The acquisition extends the segment&#8217;s reach into the outdoor and athletic specialty, natural foods and e-commerce channels. Hydro Flask&#8217;s products have a carefully cultivated brand heritage rooted in the outdoor mecca of Bend, Oregon. The aggregate purchase price for the transaction was approximately $210 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The purchase price was funded with borrowings under our credit facility. Hydro Flask calendar year 2015 revenue was approximately $54 million. 

&#160;

Company Strategies 

&#160; 

As we look to the future, we have adopted a new way of looking at our strategic choices to improve the focus of our business segments and corporate shared service organization. These choices will guide us regarding where we will operate and how we will achieve our goals in markets around the world. The overall design of our business and organizational plan is intended to create sustainable growth and improve organizational capability. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Invest in our core businesses. We have developed a portfolio of brands that are clear market leaders or have a path to grow their market position in attractive categories. We believe that prudent investment in new products, new go-to-market plans and new marketing activities can grow them organically. During fiscal year 2016, we increased our investment in those brands with the most promising potential. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Strategic, disciplined mergers and acquisitions. We have a track record of successful acquisitions and are continually looking for new businesses and opportunities to expand in categories and geographies where we believe we have critical mass and can develop a competitive advantage. We also seek to increase our brand reach through new licensing opportunities. We constantly assess our full suite of businesses to ensure each is a good fit with our long-term plans. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Invest in consumer-centric innovation. We have a long history of developing or acquiring new technologies, new products that improve consumers&#8217; lives and new designs to differentiate our products from competitors. We continue to increase our focus on innovation both in our core categories and product adjacencies. We also focus on initiatives that create commercial value for existing leadership products in order to increase their appeal and accelerate their organic growth. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Improve our organization and people systems. Our employees are our most valuable asset. Attracting, retaining and developing talent is a key focus of our company. To help us deliver strong business results, we have recently transformed our organizational structure in an effort to increase collaboration across the enterprise, implement best practices across divisions and departments and better leverage our scale. We have also adopted new compensation programs that we believe will promote greater accountability, better align management and shareholder interests and help attract and retain talent. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Best in class shared services. We have developed an outstanding, diversified base of suppliers in North America, China and Mexico. We have also invested heavily in our distribution centers and information technology systems. We continuously strive to improve our existing supplier base and infrastructure, and to develop new manufacturing partners to ensure our products are innovative, on time, on cost, and on quality. We are applying similar disciplines and best practices to achieve operational excellence and leverage scale in our back-office functions including customer service, product development, finance, legal services, human resources, investor relations, and corporate communications. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Asset efficiency. As we manage our businesses for long-term growth and success in the marketplace, we are also looking to manage our overall base of assets and capital structure to increase shareholder value. We are focused on maximizing cash flow, controlling our costs, increasing the efficiency of the capital we deploy, and optimizing working capital assets such as inventory and accounts receivable through improved systems. We also seek to optimize our capital structure, with the selective use of leverage to invest in acquisitions and, where appropriate, provide a return of capital to shareholders. 

&#160; 

We present financial information by operating segment in Note (20) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The matters discussed in this Item 1., &#8220;Business,&#8221; pertain to all existing operating segments, unless otherwise specified. 

&#160;

TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND PRODUCTS 

&#160; 

We sell certain of our products under trademarks licensed from third parties. We also market products under a number of trademarks that we own. The following is a representative listing of some of the more important trademarks by segment and major product category:

Licensed Trademarks 

&#160; 

The Beauty and Health &#38; Home segments depend upon the continued use of trademarks licensed under various agreements for a substantial portion of their net sales revenue. New product introductions under licensed trademarks require approval from the respective licensors. The licensors must also approve the product packaging. Many of our license agreements require us to pay minimum royalties, meet minimum sales volumes and some require us to make minimum levels of advertising expenditures. If we decide to renew upon expiration of their current terms, we may be required to pay renewal fees at the time of that election or we may be unable to renegotiate acceptable terms that will allow for renewal. 

&#160; 

We believe our principal trademarks, both owned and licensed, have high levels of brand name recognition among retailers and consumers throughout the world. Through our favorable association with our licensors, we believe we have developed stable, enduring relationships that provide access to unique brands that complement our owned and internally developed trademarks. W e believe all our brands have an established reputation for quality, reliability and value. 

&#160;

Patents, Other Intellectual Property and Infringement Considerations 

&#160; 

Helen of Troy maintains utility and design patents in the United States and several foreign countries. We believe the loss of the protection afforded by any one of these patents would not have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole. We also protect certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

We monitor and protect our brands against infringement, as we deem practical and appropriate; however, our ability to enforce patents, copyrights, licenses, and other intellectual property is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of various intellectual property rights in various jurisdictions. 

&#160;

We market and sell Housewares, Health &#38; Home, Nutritional Supplements, and Beauty products that we acquire, design, formulate or otherwise develop. The following table summarizes the types of products we sell by business segment:

Innovation is a core strategy of the Company. We continue to develop new products, respond to market innovations and enhance existing products with the objective of improving our market positions. Overall, in fiscal year 2016, we shipped approximately 325 new products across all of our categories. Currently, approximately 300 additional new products are in our product development pipeline for expected introduction in fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

SALES AND MARKETING 

&#160; 

We market our products in approximately 84 countries throughout the world. Sales within the United States comprised approximately 80, 79 and 77 percent of total net sales revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our segments primarily sell their products through mass merchandisers, drugstore chains, warehouse clubs, home improvement stores, catalogs, grocery stores, specialty stores, beauty supply retailers, e-commerce retailers, wholesalers, and various types of distributors, as well as directly to consumers. We collaborate extensively with our retail customers and in many instances produce specific versions of our product lines with exclusive designs and packaging for their stores, which are appropriately priced for their respective customer bases. We market products principally through the use of outside sales representatives and our own internal sales staff, supported by our internal marketing, category management, engineering, creative services, and customer and consumer service staff. These groups work closely together to develop pricing and distribution strategies, to design packaging and to help develop product line extensions and new products. 

&#160; 

The Nutritional Supplements segment sells directly to consumers through highly targeted catalog and other printed collateral mailings, internet websites and direct response print, radio and television media. The segment also sells over the telephone through a number of customer call centers. The segment maintains exclusive development and marketing relationships with several medical and wellness professionals, who provide research and advocacy for Company products and are key components of its marketing and customer outreach programs. The Nutritional Supplements segment does not have any material formal relationships with any re-distributors, nor does it maintain any field sales force outside of its call centers. 

&#160; 

The companies from whom we license many of our brand names promote those names extensively. The Honeywell, Braun, Vicks, Febreze, Revlon, Vidal Sassoon, Dr. Scholl's, Scholl, Bed Head, and Toni&#38;Guy trademarks are widely recognized because of the licensors&#8217; advertising and the sale of a variety of products in categories other than ours. We believe we benefit from the name recognition associated with a number of our licensed trademarks and seek to further improve the name recognition and perceived quality of all trademarks under which we sell products through our own advertising and product development efforts. We also promote our non-licensed products through television advertising and various media, including consumer and trade magazines, extensive in-store and customer cooperative advertising, company websites, social media websites, other digital media, and various industry trade shows. 

&#160; 

&#160;

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION 

&#160; 

We contract with unaffiliated manufacturers, primarily in China and Mexico, to manufacture a significant portion of our finished goods for the Beauty appliances, Housewares, Healthcare, Water Filtration, and Home Environment product categories. The Nutritional Supplements segment and the U.S. region of the Grooming, Skin and Hair Care category of the Beauty segment source most of their products from U.S. manufacturers. For a discussion regarding our dependency on third party manufacturers, see Item 1A., &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, finished goods manufactured by vendors in the Far East comprised approximately 68, 67 and 69 percent, respectively, of total finished goods purchased. 

&#160; 

Many of our key Far East manufacturers have been doing business with us for over 30 years. In some instances, we are now working with the second generation of entrepreneurs from the same families. We believe these relationships give us a stable and sustainable advantage over many of our competitors. Manufacturers who produce our products use formulas, molds and certain other tooling, some of which we own, in manufacturing those products. We employ numerous technical and quality control personnel responsible for ensuring high product quality. Most of our products manufactured outside the countries in which they are sold are subject to import duties, which increase the amount we pay to obtain such products. 

&#160; 

The Nutritional Supplements segment owns most of the formulations used in products it sells, with the majority having formulations that are proprietary, and in some cases, include ingredient combinations that are exclusive to the segment. The segment relies predominantly on clinically studied ingredients to validate efficacy and dosage. The segment engages in, and has completed multiple clinical studies on key proprietary formulations. Quality is paramount to the efficacy of our products and a competitive differentiator in nutritional supplements. Products are formulated and manufactured under the direction of the Company, which adheres to a rigorous triple testing method to ensure the stability, purity, potency, and safety of all finished products. 

&#160; 

Our retail customers seek to minimize their inventory levels and often demand that we fulfill their orders within relatively short time frames. Consequently, our policy is to maintain several months of supply of inventory in order to meet our customers&#8217; needs. Accordingly, we order products substantially in advance of the anticipated time of their sale to our customers. While we have limited formal long-term arrangements with our suppliers, in most instances, we place purchase orders for products several months in advance of receipt of orders from our customers. Our relationships and arrangements with most of our manufacturers allow for some flexibility in modifying the quantity, composition and delivery dates of orders. Because of long lead times for most of our foreign sourced products, from time to time, we must discount end of model product or sell it through closeout sales channels to eliminate excess inventories. Most purchase orders are in U.S. Dollars. 

&#160; 

In total, we occupy approximately 3,392,000 square feet of distribution space in various locations to support our operations, which includes a 1,200,000 square foot distribution center in Southaven, Mississippi, and a 1,300,000 square foot distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi, used to support a significant portion of our domestic distribution. We ship Housewares, Nutritional Supplements and Beauty grooming, skin care and hair care solutions products out of the Southaven facility. We ship Health &#38; Home and Beauty segment appliance products out of the Olive Branch facility. 

During fiscal year 2016, we relocated the Nutritional Supplement segment&#8217;s distribution operations to our Southaven facility. As a result of the relocation, approximately 73 percent of our consolidated gross sales volume shipped from these two facilities in fiscal year 2016. For a further discussion of the risks associated with our distribution capabilities, see Item 1A., &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; For further information about our distribution and office facilities, see Item 2., &#8220;Properties.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Products that are manufactured in the Far East and sold in North America are shipped to the West Coast of the United States and Canada. The products are then shipped by truck or rail service to distribution centers in El Paso, Texas; Southaven, Mississippi; Olive Branch, Mississippi; and Toronto, Canada, or directly to customers. We ship substantially all products to North American customers from these distribution centers by ground transportation services. The Nutritional Supplement segment&#8217;s products are shipped almost exclusively through U.S. mail and parcel delivery services. Products sold outside the United States and Canada are shipped from manufacturers, primarily in the Far East, to 

&#160;

distribution centers in Belgium, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Hong Kong or directly to customers. We then ship products stored at these international distribution centers to distributors or retailers. &#160; 

&#160; 

CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (including its worldwide affiliates) accounted for approximately 16, 18 and 19 percent of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales to our second largest customer, Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 8, 9 and 11 percent of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. No other customers accounted for 10 percent or more of consolidated net sales revenue during those fiscal years. Sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 40, 41 and 43 percent of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Nutritional Supplement segment maintains a database of over 600,000 customers to whom it actively markets. A large proportion of these customers take advantage of the segment&#8217;s auto-delivery service that periodically ships a re-supply of product, resulting in a more stable and less seasonal order flow. 

&#160; 

ORDER BACKLOG 

&#160; 

When placing orders, our individual consumer, retail and wholesale customers usually request that we ship the related products within a short time frame. As such, there usually is no significant backlog of orders in any of our distribution channels. 

&#160; 

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS 

&#160; 

The markets in which we sell our products are very competitive and mature. The rapid growth of large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to a significant consolidation of the consumer products retail industry and the formation of dominant multi-category retailers with strong negotiating power. The growth in internet sales both by traditional retailers and pure online retailers, such as Amazon, has begun to erode market share at &#8220;brick-and-mortar&#8221; retailers. Current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, insisting on maintaining or reducing prices, requiring delivery of products in shorter lead times, and a significant number of North American store closings by underperforming retail chains. Certain retailers continue to source and sell products under their own private label brands that compete with our Company&#8217;s products. We believe that we have certain key competitive advantages, such as well recognized brands, engineering expertise and innovation, sourcing and supply chain know-how, and productive co-development relationships with our Far East manufacturers, some of which have been built over 30 years or more of working together. We believe these advantages allow us to bring our retailers a value proposition in our products that can significantly out-perform private label products in most categories. Maintaining and gaining market share depends heavily on product development and enhancement, pricing, quality, performance, packaging and availability, brand name recognition, patents, and rapidly adaptive marketing and distribution approaches. 

&#160; 

We believe the market for the Nutritional Supplements segment is growing, but highly fragmented. Competition includes multi-level marketers, internet sites, specialty and mass retailers, pharmacy, grocery, and membership clubs. The primary competitive factors across these channels are pricing, perceived value and efficacy of ingredients, supporting clinical research, ease of ordering, customer service, and cost of delivery. We believe we compete favorably with respect to the above factors.

The overall sales pattern for our Nutritional Supplements segment is not highly seasonal. Our other segments are seasonal due to different calendar events, holidays and seasonal weather patterns. Historically, the third fiscal quarter produces the highest net sales revenue during the fiscal year. Seasonality in fiscal year 2015 was skewed in the latter half of the year by the inclusion of eight months of net sales revenue from Healthy Directions following its acquisition on June 30, 2014. Our working capital needs fluctuate during the year because of the impact of the seasonality of our net sales revenue. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to national, state, local, and provincial jurisdictions&#8217; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose workplace standards and regulate the discharge of pollutants into the environment. In addition, they establish various standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, and substances including solid and hazardous wastes. 

&#160; 

Many of the products we sell are subject to a number of product safety laws and regulations in various jurisdictions. These laws and regulations specify the maximum allowable levels of certain materials that may be contained in our products, provide statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products, specify product safety testing requirements, and set product identification and labeling requirements.The Nutritional Supplements segment operates almost entirely in the United States. Importing, manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling, distributing, selling, and advertising of our Nutritional Supplements segment products may be subject to regulation by one or more federal or state agencies. The Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) has primary jurisdiction over our products pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FDCA&#8221;) as amended by the Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act of 1994 (the &#8220;DSHEA&#8221;), and is responsible for issuing regulations under these and associated laws. The FDCA provides the regulatory framework for the safety and labeling of dietary supplements, foods and medical foods. In particular, the FDA regulates the safety, manufacturing, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements. The Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the FDA share jurisdiction over the promotion and advertising of dietary supplements. Pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the two agencies, the FDA has primary jurisdiction over claims that appear on product labels and labeling and the FTC has primary jurisdiction over product advertising. 

&#160; 

FDA rules impose requirements on the manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, and distribution of dietary supplement products. For example, it requires that companies establish extensive written procedures and controls governing areas such as: (1) personnel, (2) plant and equipment cleanliness, (3) production controls, (4) laboratory operations, (5) packaging and labeling, (6) distribution, (7) product returns, and (8) complaint handling. The FDA also requires identity testing of all incoming ingredients unless a company successfully petitions for an exemption from this testing requirement in accordance with the regulations. FDA prescribed good manufacturing practices are designed to ensure that dietary supplements and dietary ingredients are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled to reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products. 

&#160;

Additionally, an emerging trend with both governments and our retail customers is to prescribe public and private social accountability reporting requirements regarding our worldwide business activities. In our product space, some requirements have already been mandated and we believe others may become required. Examples of current requirements include conflict minerals content reporting and reporting of foreign fair labor practices in connection with our supply chain vendors. 

&#160; 

We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws, regulations and other reporting requirements. Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition, nor do we expect it to do so in the foreseeable future. Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of compliance and social reporting standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other reporting mandates. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016, we employed approximately 1,610 full-time employees worldwide. We also use temporary, part-time and seasonal employees as needed. None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Certain of our employees in Europe are covered by collective arrangements in accordance with local practice. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe that we have satisfactory working relations with our employees.
