&#160;

Competition 

The markets in which the Company operates are highly competitive. Important competitive variables in the hospitality market include functionality, reliability, quality, pricing, service and support. In the restaurant market, PAR believes its competitive advantages include the focus on an integrated technology solution offering including cloud-based software, ruggedized purpose-built hardware, advanced development capabilities, extensive domain knowledge and expertise, excellent product reliability, a direct sales force organization, world class support and quick service response. Most of our significant customers have approved several suppliers offering some form of sophisticated hospitality technology system similar to that of the Company. PAR&#8217;s competition is comprised of traditional and emerging companies including: Oracle Corporation, NCR Corporation and Panasonic Corporation.

Backlog 

Due to the nature of the hospitality business, backlog is not significant at any point in time. The Hospitality segment orders are generally of a short-term nature and are usually booked and shipped in less than 12 months.

Research and Development 

The highly technical nature of the Company&#8217;s hospitality products requires a significant and continuous research and development effort. Ongoing product research and quality development efforts are an integral part of all activities within the Company. Functional and technical enhancements are actively being made to our products to increase customer satisfaction and maintain the high caliber of PAR&#8217;s software. Research and development expenses from continuing operations were approximately $10.2 million in 2015 and $8.9 million in 2014. The Company capitalizes certain software costs in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic No. 985. See Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 for further discussion.

The Company&#8217;s technical staff continuously evaluate new technologies and adopt those that allow PAR to provide significant improvements in customers&#8217; day-to-day systems. From hand-held wireless devices to advances in internet performance, the Company&#8217;s professional services unit is available for consultation on a wide variety of topics including network infrastructures, system functionality, operating system platforms, and hardware expandability. In addition, the Company has secured strategic partnerships with third-party organizations to offer a variety of credit, debit and gift card payment options.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Suppliers 

The Company sources and/or assembles most of its products from standard electronic components, fabricated parts such as printed circuit boards, and mechanical components. Many assemblies and components are manufactured by third parties to the Company&#8217;s specifications. PAR depends on outside suppliers for the continued availability of its assemblies and components. Although most items are generally available from a number of different suppliers, PAR purchases certain final assemblies and components from single sources. Items purchased from single sources include certain POS devices, peripherals, custom molded and tooled components, electronic assemblies and components. If such a supplier should cease to supply an item, PAR believes new sources could be found to provide the components. However, added cost and manufacturing delays could result and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s performance. The Company has not experienced significant delays of this nature in the past, but there can be no assurance that delays in delivery due to supply shortages will not occur in the future.

Intellectual Property 

The Company owns or has rights to certain patents, copyrights and trademarks. PAR relies upon non-disclosure agreements, license agreements and applicable domestic and foreign patent, copyright and trademark laws for protection of our intellectual property. To the extent such protective measures are unsuccessful, or the Company needs to enter into protracted litigation to enforce such rights, the Company&#8217;s business could be adversely impacted. Similarly, there is no assurance that the Company&#8217;s products will not become the subject of a third-party claim of infringement or misappropriation. To the extent such claims result in costly litigation or force the Company to enter into royalty or license agreements, rather than enter into a prolonged dispute, our performance could be adversely impacted. The Company also licenses certain third-party patents and software with its products. While PAR maintains strong relationships with its licensors, there is no assurance such relationships will continue or that the licenses will be continued under fees and terms acceptable to the Company.

&#160;

Government Segment

PAR&#8217;s Government business provides a range of technical services for the DoD and federal agencies. This segment is dedicated to serving ISR customers, through specialized development of advanced signal and image processing and management systems with a focus on geospatial intelligence, geographic information systems, and command and control applications. Additionally, this business provides mission critical telecommunications, satellite command and control, and information technology operations and maintenance services worldwide to the U.S. DoD.

The business is organized in two operating sectors that provide comprehensive service offerings across their customer base ISR Solutions and mission systems.

The ISR solutions sector provides systems engineering support and software-based solutions. Expertise ranges from theoretical and experimental studies to development and fielding of operational prototypes. PAR&#8217;s employees are: experienced developers and subject-matter experts in DoD Full Motion Video (&#8220;FMV&#8221;) formats include MPEG-2, H.264, and standard/high definition (&#8220;SD/HD&#8221;) support; developers of geospatial and imagery data management, visualization, and exploitation solutions; major contributor to radar systems from inception to operational capabilities; developers and integrators of light weight Electro-Optical (&#8220;EO&#8221;), Infrared (&#8220;IR&#8221;), multi and hyperspectral sensor and processing systems; light detection and ranging (&#8220;LiDAR&#8221;) processing systems; developers of certified systems employing multi and hyperspectral imaging to include target detection and cueing algorithms, IR search and track technology, and algorithms for camouflage detection and buried mines; and developers of geospatial information system (&#8220;GIS&#8221;)-based modeling solutions. This sector of the Company has an active business in the development of mobility applications that support the needs of mobile teams with real-time situation awareness and distributed communications. The ISR solutions sector has a strong legacy in the advanced research, development and productization of geospatial information assurance (&#8220;GIA&#8221;) technology involving steganography, steganalysis, digital watermarking, and image forensics. These enabling technologies have been used to provide increased protection and security of geospatial data. The ISR Solutions Sector also provides scientific and technical support to the US Intelligence Community.

&#160;

The mission systems sector includes three distinct lines of business: telecommunications, satellite control, and information technology services. The telecommunication services include satellite and terrestrial communications operations and maintenance services, which operate elements of the US DoD&#8217;s global information grid (&#8220;GIG&#8221;) in support of the national command authority (President &#38; joint chiefs of staff) and Department of Defense. Additionally, PAR operates the U.S. navy&#8217;s only satellite operations center providing tracking, telemetry and control of several space-based satellite communication constellations. Finally, the Company&#8217;s mission systems sector provides IT services ranging from advanced systems management to help desk support. Approximately 50% of this sector&#8217;s global footprint is outside the continental US with contracts in Europe, Africa, Australia, and US Commonwealths and Territories in the Pacific and Caribbean. The Company has strong and enduring relationships with a diverse set of customers throughout the U.S. DoD and federal government. PAR&#8217;s track record delivering mission critical services to their government customers spans decades, and includes contracts continuing 15 years or more. The Company works closely with its customers, with the vast majority of the mission systems sector employees co-located at customer sites. PAR&#8217;s strong relationships and on-site presence with customers enable the Company to develop deep customer and technical domain knowledge, and translate mission understanding into exemplary program execution and continued demand for its services.

PAR focuses its business in five service areas:

ISR:

Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance: &#160; The Company provides a variety of geospatial intelligence solutions including full motion video, geospatial information assurance, raster imagery, and LiDAR. In depth expertise in these domains provides government customers and large systems integrators with key technologies supporting a range of applications from strategic enterprise systems to tactical individual users. Furthermore, PAR has developed a number of products relative to these advanced technologies and provides integration and training support.

Mission Systems:

Systems Engineering &#38; Evaluation: &#160; The Company integrates and tests EO, IR, Radar, and multi/hyper-spectral sensor systems for a broad range of government and industry surveillance applications. The Company designs and integrates radar sensor systems including experimentation, demonstration, and test support. The Company also provides scientific and technical engineering and analysis to intelligence community customers, as well as program management services for the acquisition, development, and deployment of advanced prototypes and quick reaction systems.

&#160;

Satellite &#38; Telecommunications Services : The Company provides a wide range of technical and support services to sustain mission critical components of the DoD&#8217;s global information grid (&#8220;GIG&#8221;). These services include continuous 24/7/365 operations, system enhancements and associated maintenance of very low frequency (&#8220;VLF&#8221;), high frequency (&#8220;HF&#8221;) and very high frequency (&#8220;VHF&#8221;) ground-based radio transmitter/receiver facilities. Additionally, the Company operates and maintains several extremely high frequency (&#8220;EHF&#8221;) and super high frequency (&#8220;SHF&#8221;) satellite communication earth terminals and teleport facilities. The DoD communications earth stations operated by the Company is the primary communications infrastructure utilized by the national command authority and military services to exercise command and control of the nation&#8217;s air, land and naval forces and provide support to allied coalition forces.

Space &#38; Satellite Control Services: &#160; The Company provides satellite operation, management, and maintenance services in support of satellite control center operations. Primary services include satellite telemetry monitoring, tracking and command support, and satellite control in order to provide reliable space-based satellite services conducting command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (&#8220;C4ISR&#8221;) operations. The Company delivers services in support of satellite telemetry, tracking, control and remote terminal operations from 7 locations worldwide.

Information Technology/Systems Services: &#160; The Company &#160; provides information technology services to the DoD and federal agencies. These services include helpdesk services, systems administration, network administration, information assurance and systems security, database administration, telephone systems management, testing and testbed management, and ITIL-based service management.

Government Contracts 

The Company performs work for U.S. Government agencies under firm fixed-price, cost-plus-fixed-fee, and time-and-material contracts. The majority of these contracts have a period of performance of one to five years. There are several risks associated with government contracting. For instance, contracts may be reduced in size, scope and value, as well as modified, delayed and/or cancelled depending upon the government&#8217;s requests, budgets, policies and/or changes in regulations. Contracts can also be terminated for the convenience of the government at any time the government believes that such termination would be in its best interests. In this circumstance, the Company is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and, in general, a proportionate share of its fee or profit for the work actually performed. The Company may also perform work prior to formal authorization or prior to adjustment of the contract price for increased work scope, change orders and other funding adjustments. In this situation, the Company is performing the work under our own risk and would be responsible for any costs incurred during this time. Additionally, the defense contract audit agency regularly audits the financial records of the Company. Such audits can result in adjustments to contract costs and fees. Audits have been completed through the Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2013 and have not resulted in any material adjustments.

&#160;

Marketing and Competition 

Contracts are obtained principally through competitive proposals in response to solicitations from government organizations and prime contractors. In addition, the Company sometimes obtains contracts by submitting unsolicited proposals. Although the Company believes it is well positioned in its business areas, competition for government contracts is intense. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors are major corporations, or subsidiaries thereof, that are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial resources. The Company also competes with many smaller, economically disadvantaged companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential &#8220;set aside&#8221; treatment, that target particular segments of the government contract market. The principal competitive factors are past performance, the ability to perform the statement of work, price, technological capabilities, management capabilities and service. Many of the Company&#8217;s department of defense customers are now migrating to low-price/technically acceptable procurements while leveraging commercial software standards, applications, and solutions.

Backlog 

The value of existing Government contracts at December 31, 2015, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date was approximately $101.2 million, of which $48.4 million was funded. The value of existing Government contracts at December 31, 2014, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date was approximately $100.4 million, of which $53.9 million was funded. Funded amounts represent those amounts committed under contract by Government agencies and prime contractors. The December 31, 2015 Government contract backlog of $101.2 million represents firm, existing contracts. Of this backlog amount, approximately $64.8 million is expected to be completed in calendar year 2016, as funding is committed.

&#160;

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 1,010 employees, approximately 54% of whom were engaged in the Company&#8217;s Hospitality segment, 41% of whom were in the Government segment, and 5% of whom were corporate employees.

Due to the highly technical nature of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company&#8217;s future can be significantly influenced by its ability to attract and retain its technical staff. The Company believes it has and will be able to continue to fulfill its near-term needs for technical staff.

Approximately 13% of the Company&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
