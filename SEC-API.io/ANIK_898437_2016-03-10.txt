 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are a global, integrated orthopedic medicines company committed to improving the lives of patients with degenerative orthopedic diseases and traumatic conditions by providing innovative and differentiated therapeutic pain management solutions along the continuum of care, from palliative care to regenerative medicine. We have over two decades of expertise developing, manufacturing and commercializing more than 20 products, in markets across the globe, based on our proprietary hyaluronic acid (&#8220;HA&#8221;) technology. Our orthopedic medicine portfolio is comprised of marketed (ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC) and pipeline (CINGAL and HYALOFAST in the United States) products to alleviate pain and restore joint function by replenishing depleted HA and aiding cartilage repair and regeneration.

&#160;

Our therapeutic offerings consist of products in the following areas: Orthobiologics, Dermal, Surgical, Ophthalmic, and Veterinary. All of our products are based on HA, a naturally occurring, biocompatible polymer found throughout the body. Due to its unique biophysical and biochemical properties, HA plays an important role in a number of physiological functions such as the protection and lubrication of soft tissues and joints, the maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues, and the transport of molecules to and within cells.

&#160;

Our proprietary technologies for modifying the HA molecule allow product properties to be tailored specifically to therapeutic use. Our patented technology chemically modifies HA to allow for longer residence time in the body. We also offer products made from HA based on two other technologies: HYAFF, which is a solid form of HA, and ACP gel, an autocross-linked polymer of HA. Our technologies are protected by an extensive portfolio of owned and licensed patents.

&#160;

Since our inception in 1992, we have utilized a commercial partnership model for the distribution of our products to end users. Our strong, worldwide network of distributors has historically provided, and continues to provide, a solid foundation for our revenue growth and territorial expansion. In 2015, we made the strategic decision to commercialize our next generation viscosupplementation product, CINGAL, in the United States by utilizing a direct sales model, initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization. Ultimately, we intend to transition the direct sales function into our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities. We believe that the combination of the direct and distribution commercial models will maximize the revenue potential from our current and future product portfolio.

&#160;

We began a strategic project in 2015 to move the manufacturing of our HYAFF-based products, which currently are manufactured by a third party in Italy, to our Bedford, Massachusetts facility. Our main purposes behind this strategic move are to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing process and to enhance our research and development capabilities, with the aim of accelerating future product development. We expect to expend approximately $15 million on this project over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.

&#160;

The following sections provide more specific information about our products and related activities:

&#160;

Orthobiologics 

&#160;

Our orthobiologics products primarily consist of viscosupplementation and regenerative orthopedics products. These products are used in a wide range of treatments, from providing pain relief from osteoarthritis, to regenerating damaged tissue such as cartilage. Osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease causing pain, swelling, and restricted movement in joints. It occurs when the cartilage in a joint gradually deteriorates due to the effects of mechanical stress, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including the normal aging process. In an osteoarthritic joint, particular regions of articulating surfaces are exposed to irregular forces, which results in the remodeling of tissue surfaces that disrupt the normal equilibrium or mechanical function. As osteoarthritis advances, the joint gradually loses its ability to regenerate cartilage tissue, and the cartilage layer attached to the bone deteriorates to the point where eventually the bone becomes exposed. Advanced osteoarthritis often requires surgery and the possible implantation of artificial joints. The current treatment options for osteoarthritis, before joint replacement surgery, include viscosupplementation, analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroid injections.

&#160;

&#160;

Our viscosupplementation franchise includes ORTHOVISC, ORTHOVISC mini , MONOVISC, and CINGAL. ORTHOVISC is available in the United States, Canada, and other international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, and in Europe and certain international markets for the treatment of osteoarthritis in all joints. In the U.S. market, ORTHOVISC is the lead product in the multi-injection segment, and the number two viscosupplementation product overall. ORTHOVISC mini is available in Europe, and it is designed for the treatment of osteoarthritis in small joints. MONOVISC is our single injection osteoarthritis treatment indicated for all joints in Europe and certain international markets, and for the knee in the United States, Turkey, and Canada. ORTHOVISC has been marketed by us internationally since 1996. ORTHOVISC mini and MONOVISC became available in certain international markets in the second quarter of 2008. MONOVISC was approved by the FDA for sale in the United States in February 2014, and the related U.S. commercial introduction of the product occurred in April 2014. CINGAL, our second single-injection osteoarthritis product, received regulatory approval from Health Canada in November 2015, and we expect the related commercial introduction of CINGAL in Canada to occur in the second quarter of 2016. We are currently seeking regulatory approval of CINGAL in the United States and the European Union. Upon achievement, if any, of such regulatory approval in the United States, we plan to commercialize the product through a direct sales model, initially through the engagement of a contract sales organization, with the ultimate goal of transitioning the direct sales function into our company as part of a broader buildout of our commercial capabilities.

&#160;

In the United States, ORTHOVISC is indicated for the treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative, non-pharmacologic therapy and to simple analgesics, such as acetaminophen. ORTHOVISC is a sterile, clear, viscous solution of hyaluronan dissolved in physiological saline and dispensed in a single-use syringe. A complex sugar of the glycosaminoglycan family, hyaluronan is a high molecular weight polysaccharide composed of repeating disaccharide units of sodium glucuronate and N-acetyl glucosamine. ORTHOVISC is injected into joints in a series of three intra-articular injections one week apart. ORTHOVISC became available for sale in the United States on March 1, 2004, and it is marketed by DePuy Synthes Mitek Sports Medicine (&#8220;Mitek&#8221;) under the terms of a ten-year licensing, distribution, supply, and marketing agreement which was entered into in December 2003 and was extended for an additional 5 years in November 2012 (the &#8220;Mitek ORTHOVISC Agreement&#8221;). Outside of the U.S., we have a number of distribution relationships servicing international markets including Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. We will continue to seek to establish distribution relationships in other key markets. See the sections captioned &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Management Overview &#8221; and &#8220; Risk Factors. &#8221;

&#160;

In the United States, MONOVISC is also indicated for the treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative, non-pharmacologic therapy and to simple analgesics, such as acetaminophen. MONOVISC is a sterile, clear, viscous solution of partially cross-linked sodium hyaluronate in a phosphate buffered saline solution. A treatment of MONOVISC is comprised of one injection of the product delivered directly into the affected joint. MONOVISC became available for sale in the United States in April 2014, and it is also marketed by Mitek under the terms of a fifteen-year licensing, distribution, supply, and marketing agreement, which was entered into on December 21, 2011 (the &#8220;Mitek MONOVISC Agreement&#8221;). Outside of the United States, we have a number of distribution relationships servicing international markets including Canada, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and certain other international countries. We continue to seek to establish distribution relationships in other key markets. See the sections captioned &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Management Overview &#8221; and &#8220; Risk Factors. &#8221;

&#160;

In addition to the four viscosupplementation products discussed above, we also offer several additional products used in connection with orthopedic regenerative medicine. These products are based on the HYAFF technology and are currently available in Europe, South America, and Asia. They include HYALOFAST, a biodegradable support for human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells used for cartilage regeneration and as an adjunct for microfracture surgery; HYALONECT, a woven gauze used as a graft wrap; and HYALOSS MATRIX, HYAFF fibers used to mix blood/bone grafts to form a paste for bone regeneration. We also offer HYALOGLIDE, an ACP gel used in tenolysis treatment, with the potential for use in flexor tendon adhesion prevention and for use in the shoulder for prevention of adhesive capsulitis with additional clinical data. These products are commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in Europe, the Middle East, and Korea. In total, orthobiologics products accounted for 84%, 82%, and 78% of our product revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013 respectively.

&#160;

Dermal 

&#160;

Our dermal products consist of advanced wound care products, based on the HYAFF technology, and aesthetic dermal fillers, based on our proprietary chemically modified cross-linked HA technology, BCDI. Products utilizing our HYAFF technology are used for the treatment of skin wounds, ranging from burns to diabetic ulcers. The products cover a variety of wound treatment solutions including debridement agents, advanced therapies to aid healing, and scaffolds used as skin substitutes. Leading products include HYALOMATRIX and HYALOFILL, for the treatment of complex wounds such as burns and ulcers. The dermal products are commercialized through a network of distributors, primarily in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Several of the products are also cleared for sale in the United States including HYALOMATRIX, HYALOFILL, HYALOGRAN, and HYALOMATRIX 3D. We previously entered into a distribution agreement for the sale of advanced wound care products in nine South American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile, on an exclusive basis through 2018. We have also entered into an agreement with Medline Industries, Inc. to commercialize HYALOMATRIX in the United States on an exclusive basis through 2019.

&#160;

Our aesthetic dermatology product is a dermal filler based on our proprietary, chemically modified, cross-linked HA, and it is commercialized in certain European Union countries, Canada, the United States, and Korea. Internationally, this product is marketed under the ELEVESS name. In the United States, the trade name is HYDRELLE, although the product is not currently marketed in the United States.

&#160;

Surgical 

&#160;

Our surgical business consists of products used to prevent post-surgical adhesions after abdominal-pelvic, spinal, and ear, nose, and throat (&#8220;ENT&#8221;) surgeries. HYALOBARRIER is a clinically proven post-operative adhesion barrier for use in the abdominopelvic area. The product is currently commercialized in Europe, the Middle East, and certain Asian countries through a distribution network, but it is not approved for sale in the United States. HYALOSPINE, a product designed to prevent post-surgical adhesions following spinal surgery, was CE Mark approved in January 2015 for sale in Europe. INCERT, approved for sale and commercialized through a network of distributors in Europe, Turkey, and Malaysia, is a chemically modified, cross-linked HA product, for the prevention of spinal post-surgical adhesions. There are currently no plans at this time to distribute INCERT in the United States. We co-own issued U.S. patents covering the use of INCERT for adhesion prevention. See the section captioned &#8220; Patent and Proprietary Rights.&#8221; 

&#160;

Surgical adhesions occur when fibrous bands of tissues form between adjacent tissue layers during the wound healing process. Although surgeons attempt to minimize the formation of adhesions, they nevertheless occur quite frequently after surgery. Adhesions in the abdominal and pelvic cavity can cause particularly serious problems such as intestinal blockage following abdominal surgery and infertility following pelvic surgery. Fibrosis following spinal surgery can complicate re-operation and may cause pain.

&#160;

We offer several products used in connection with the treatment of ENT disorders. The lead products are MEROGEL, a woven fleece nasal packing, and MEROGEL INJECTABLE, a thick, viscous hydrogel composed of cross-linked hyaluronic acid&#8212;a biocompatible agent that creates a moist wound-healing environment. We have partnered with Medtronic XoMed, Inc. (&#8220;Medtronic&#8221;) for worldwide distribution of these ENT products.

&#160;

Ophthalmic 

&#160;

Our ophthalmic business includes HA viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery. The ophthalmic products we manufacture include STAARVISC-II, OPTIVISC (formerly ShellGel), ANIKAVISC, and NUVISC. They are injectable, high molecular weight HA products used as viscoelastic agents in ophthalmic surgical procedures such as cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. These products coat, lubricate, and protect sensitive tissue such as the endothelium, and they function to maintain the shape of the eye, thereby facilitating ophthalmic surgical procedures.

&#160;

We previously manufactured the AMVISC product line for Bausch &#38; Lomb (&#8220;B&#38;L&#8221;) under the terms of an exclusive supply agreement that expired on December 31, 2010 (the &#8220;2004 B&#38;L Agreement&#8221;) for viscoelastic products used in ophthalmic surgery. Effective January 1, 2011, we entered into a non-exclusive, two year contract with B&#38;L intended to transition the manufacture of AMVISC and AMVISC Plus to an alternative, low-cost supplier formerly affiliated with B&#38;L, and continued to supply B&#38;L with these products during 2011. Effective January 1, 2012, the parties agreed to a three year contract for us to continue to supply these products to B&#38;L as a second supplier with committed annual volumes through year-end 2014, and the contract was not renewed upon expiration.

Veterinary 

&#160;

HYVISC is a high molecular weight injectable HA product for the treatment of joint dysfunction in horses due to non-infectious synovitis associated with equine osteoarthritis. HYVISC has viscoelastic properties that lubricate and protect the tissues in horse joints. HYVISC is distributed by Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc. (&#8220;Boehringer&#8221;) in the United States and in selected countries in the Middle East.

&#160;

See also the section captioned &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212;We experience quarterly sales volume variation, which makes our future results difficult to predict and makes period-to-period comparisons potentially not meaningful &#8221; for a discussion regarding the effect that quarterly sales volume variation could have on our business and financial performance.

&#160;

See also the section captioned &#8220; Risk Factors &#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212;A significant portion of our revenues are derived from a small number of customers, the loss of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations &#8221; for a discussion regarding our dependence on large-volume customers and the effects that the loss of any such customer could have on our business and financial performance.

&#160;

See also the section captioned &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212;Our manufacturing processes involve inherent risks, and disruption could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations &#8221; for a discussion of the sources and availability of raw materials related to the manufacture of our products.

&#160;

Research and Development of Potential Products 

&#160;

Our research and development efforts primarily consist of the development of new medical applications for our HA-based technology, the management of clinical trials for certain product candidates, the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory approvals or clearances at all relevant stages of product development, and process development and scale-up manufacturing activities for our existing and new products. Our development focus includes products for tissue protection, repair, and regeneration. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, these expenses were $9.0 million, $8.1 million, and $7.1 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources to research and development, including in relation to clinical trials, in the future.

&#160;

Our second single-injection osteoarthritis product under development is CINGAL, which is composed of our proprietary cross-linked HA material combined with an approved steroid and is designed to provide both short- and long-term pain relief to patients. We completed the CINGAL phase III clinical trial and associated statistical analysis during the fourth quarter of 2014. During the first half of 2015, we completed a CINGAL retreatment study with patients who had participated in the phase III clinical trial and reported safety data related to the retreatment study. On the regulatory front, we submitted an application for CE Mark approval of the product in December 2014, and we expect to achieve approval by the end of April 2016. In May 2015, we also submitted an application for regulatory approval of CINGAL to Health Canada, and we received notification of approval for CINGAL from Health Canada in early November 2015. After discussion with the FDA related to the regulatory pathway for CINGAL in the United States, we conducted a formal meeting with the FDA&#8217;s Office of Combination Products (&#8220;OCP&#8221;) to present and discuss our data in September 2015, and we submitted a formal request for designation with OCP a month later. In its response to our formal request for designation, OCP assigned the product to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (&#8220;CDER&#8221;) as the lead agency center for premarket review and regulation. Since then, we have been in ongoing discussions with CDER to understand the requirements for submitting a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) for CINGAL, and preliminary indications from the FDA suggest that additional clinical work may be required. We will meet with the FDA to collaboratively discuss this topic.

&#160;

We have research and development programs underway for new products including for HYALOFAST, an innovative product for cartilage tissue repair, HYALOBONE, a bone void filler, and other early stage regenerative medicine development programs. HYALOFAST received CE Mark approval in September 2009, and it is commercially available in Europe and certain international countries. During the first quarter of 2015, we submitted an Investigational Device Exemption (&#8220;IDE&#8221;) to the FDA, which was approved in July 2015. We are in the early stages of the phase III clinical trial for HYALOFAST, and we enrolled our first patient in December 2015. Another of our products, HYALOSPINE, is an innovative adhesion prevention gel for use after spinal surgery. We completed a HYALOSPINE pilot clinical study in 2012, submitted the CE Mark application in September 2013, and received the CE Mark approval in January 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

In June 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to collaborate on research to develop a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this research is to develop a novel modality for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and if successful, it is expected to yield a potential product candidate that we could begin to move towards commercialization as early as 2017.

&#160;

Our research and development efforts may not be successful in (1) developing our existing product candidates, (2) expanding the therapeutic applications of our existing products, or (3) resulting in new applications for our HA technology. There is also a risk that we may choose not to pursue development of potential product candidates. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any new applications we develop. Furthermore, even if all regulatory approvals are obtained, there can be no assurances that we will achieve meaningful sales of such products or applications.

&#160;

Patent and Proprietary Rights 

&#160;

Our products and trademarks, including our Company name, product names, and logos, are proprietary. We rely on a combination of patent protection, trade secrets and trademark laws, license agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary information.

&#160;

We have a policy of seeking patent protection for patentable aspects of our proprietary technology. In the United States, we own 26 patents, 2 of which are co-owned with other parties, license 18 patents, and have 2 patent applications currently pending. These U.S. patents have expiration dates through 2030. Internationally, we own 190 patents, 7 of which are co-owned with other parties, license 88 patents, and have 10 patent applications currently pending. Outside of the United States, we own, co-own, license, or have filed for patents in 38 jurisdictions. Our international patents have expiration dates through 2032. Many of these patents, including all licensed patents, belong to the Anika S.r.l. patent estate, which is extensive and partly intertwined with its former parent company, Fidia Farmaceutici S.p.A. (&#8220;Fidia&#8221;), through a patent licensing agreement that provides Anika S.r.l. with access to certain of Fidia&#8217;s patents to the extent required to support Anika S.r.l.&#8217;s products. We intend to seek patent protection for products and processes developed in the course of our activities when we believe such protection is in our best interests and when the cost of seeking such protection is not inordinate relative to the potential benefits.

&#160;

Other entities have filed patent applications for, or have been issued patents concerning, various aspects of HA-related products or processes. In addition, the products or processes we develop may infringe the patent rights of others in the future. Any such infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

&#160;

We rely upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how for certain non-patented aspects of our technology. To protect such information, we require certain customers and vendors, and all employees, consultants, and licensees to enter into confidentiality agreements limiting the disclosure and use of such information. These agreements, however, may not provide adequate protection.

&#160;

See also the section captioned &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. &#8221; 

&#160;

We have granted Mitek an exclusive and non-transferable royalty bearing license to develop, commercialize, and sell ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in the United States pursuant to the Mitek ORTHOVISC Agreement and the Mitek MONOVISC Agreement. These agreements include a license to manufacture, and have manufactured, such products in the event that we are unable to supply Mitek with ORTHOVISC or MONOVISC in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement. We have also granted Mitek the exclusive, royalty free right to use the trademarks ORTHOVISC and MONOVISC in connection with the marketing, distribution, and sale of the licensed products within the United States.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The clinical development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products are subject to governmental regulation in the United States, the European Union and other territories worldwide. Various statutes, regulations, directives, and guidelines, including the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act in the United States, govern the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, and promotion of our products. Product development and approval within these various regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are also inspected regularly by the FDA and other applicable regulatory bodies.

&#160;

- 9 - 

&#160;

Medical products regulated by the FDA are generally classified as drugs, biologics, or medical devices. Medical devices intended for human use are classified into three categories (Class I, II or III) on the basis of the controls deemed reasonably necessary by the FDA to assure their safety and effectiveness. Class II devices are cleared for marketing under the premarket notification 510(k) regulatory pathway, which may include clinical testing. Class III devices require pre-market approval based on valid scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness, including evidence elicited through appropriate clinical testing. Drugs and biologic products undergo rigorous preclinical testing prior to beginning clinical trials. Clinical trials for new drugs or biologic products include Phase I trials in healthy volunteers to understand safety, dosage tolerance, and pharmacokinetics, Phase II trials in a limited patient population to identify initial efficacy and side effects, and Phase III pivotal trials to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product. The failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety, and efficacy of a product under development can delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product. In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit to the relevant regulatory authority for review information on the quality aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. The FDA undertakes this review in the United States.

&#160;

In the European Union, medical devices must be CE Marked in order to be marketed. CE marking a device involves working with a Notified Body, and in some cases a Competent Authority, to demonstrate that the device meets all applicable requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and that our Quality Management System is compliant. Drug approval in the European Union follows one of several possible processes: (i) a centralized procedure involving members of the European Medicines Agency&#8217;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use; (ii) a &#8220;mutual recognition procedure&#8221; in which an individual country's regulatory agency approves the product followed by &#8220;mutual recognition&#8221; of this review by regulatory agencies of other countries; or (iii) a decentralized procedure in which the approval is sought through the regulatory agencies of multiple countries at the same time.

&#160;

Approval timelines can range from several months to several years, or applications can be denied entirely. The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. For example, additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review, which may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. As a condition of approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects, and may require other additional studies, as it deems appropriate. After approval for an initial indication, further clinical studies are generally necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product.

&#160;

As a condition of approval, the relevant regulatory agency requires that the product continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements related to quality, safety, and efficacy, and it requires strict procedures to monitor and report any adverse effects. Where adverse effects occur or may occur, the regulatory agency may require additional studies or changes to the labeling. Compelling new &#8220;adverse&#8221; data may result in a product approval being withdrawn at any stage following review by an agency and discussion with product manufacturer.

&#160;

The branch of the FDA responsible for product marketing oversight routinely reviews company marketing practices and also may impose pre-clearance requirements on materials intended for use in marketing of approved drug products. We are also subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Similar review and regulation of advertising and marketing practices exists in the other geographic areas where the company operates.

&#160;

The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, such as issuing an FDA Form 483 notice of inspectional observations, a warning letter, an untitled letter, imposing civil money penalties, suspending or delaying issuance of approvals, requiring product recall, imposing a total or partial shutdown of production, withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted, pursuing product seizures, consent decrees or other injunctive relief, or criminal prosecution through the Department of Justice. The FDA can also require us to repair, replace or refund the cost of products that we manufactured or distributed. Outside the US, regulatory agencies may exert a range of similar powers.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We compete with many companies including, among others, large pharmaceutical firms and specialized medical products companies, across all of our product lines. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs, more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations, and more experience in the regulatory processes than we have. We also compete with academic institutions, government agencies, and other research organizations, which may be involved in the research and development and commercialization of products. Many of our competitors also compete against us in securing relationships with collaborators for their research and development and commercialization programs.

&#160;

We compete with other market participants primarily on the efficacy of our products, our products&#8217; reputation for safety, our focus solely on HA-based products, and the breadth of our HA-based product portfolio. Other factors that impact competition in our industry are the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability of raw material and finished product supply, marketing and sales capability, reimbursement coverage, product pricing, and patent protection. Some of the principal factors that may affect our ability to compete in the HA development and commercialization markets include:

&#160;

&#183; The quality and breadth of our continued development of our technology portfolio; &#160;

&#183; Our ability to complete successful clinical studies and obtain FDA marketing and foreign regulatory approvals prior to our competitors; &#160;

&#183; The successful execution of our commercial strategies; &#160;

&#183; Our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and &#160;

&#183; The availability of capital resources to fund strategic activities related to the significant expansion of our business or product portfolio. &#160;

We are aware of several companies that are developing and/or marketing products utilizing HA for a variety of human applications. In some cases, competitors have already obtained product approvals, submitted applications for approval or commenced human clinical studies, either in the United States or in certain foreign countries. All of our products face substantial competition. There exist major worldwide competing products, made from HA and other materials, for use in orthopedics, surgical adhesion prevention, advanced wound care, ENT, cosmetic dermatology, and ophthalmic surgery. There is a risk that we will be unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors. Additionally, legislation and regulation aimed at curbing rising healthcare costs has resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create larger companies, including hospitals, with greater market power. In turn, this has led to greater and more intense competition in the provision of products and services to market participants. Important market makers, like group purchasing organizations, have increased their negotiating leverage, and if these market makers demand significant price concessions or if we are excluded as a supplier by these market makers, our product revenue could be adversely impacted. See also the sections captioned &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212;Substantial competition could materially affect our financial performance &#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#8212;Our business may be adversely affected if consolidation in the healthcare industry leads to demand for price concessions or if we are excluded from being a supplier by a group purchasing organization or similar entity&#8221; for additional discussion of the impact competition could have on our business and financial results.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 107 employees, 20 of whom were located outside the United States. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions, but most of the employees based in Italy are represented by unions, adding complexity and additional risks to the wage and employment decision process.

&#160;

Environmental Laws 

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental regulations with respect to our manufacturing facilities and that the cost of ongoing compliance with such regulations does not have a material effect on our operations.

&#160;

- 11 - 

&#160;

Product Liability

The testing, marketing, and sale of human health care products entails an inherent risk of allegations of product liability, and we cannot assure that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against us. Although we have not received any material product liability claims to date and have coverage under our insurance policy of $5.0 million per occurrence and $5.0 million in the aggregate, we cannot assure that if material claims arise in the future, our insurance will be adequate to cover all situations. Moreover, we cannot assure that such insurance, or additional insurance, if required, will be available in the future or, if available, will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Any product liability claim, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.
