General 

&#160; 

We are a leading medical technology company dedicated to peripheral nerve repair. We provide products and education to improve surgical treatment algorithms for peripheral nerve injuries. Our portfolio of regenerative medicine products is available in the United States, Canada and several other countries and includes Avance &#174; Nerve Graft, an off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site, AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector, a porcine submucosa extracellular matrix (&#8220;ECM&#8221;) coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed nerves, and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect injured peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments. Along with these core surgical products, we also offer the AxoTouch TM Two-Point Discriminator and expect to launch in March 2016 the AcroVal&#8482; Neurosensory and Motor Testing System. These evaluation and measurement tools assist healthcare professionals in detecting changes in sensation, assessing return of sensory, grip and pinch function, evaluating effective treatment interventions, and providing feedback to patients. The introduction of our evaluation and measurement products further reflects our commitment to bring best practices to the treatment of peripheral nerve conditions. 

&#160; 

Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body and their damage can result in the loss of muscle function and/or feeling. &#160; Nerves can be damaged in a number of ways. When a nerve is cut due to a traumatic injury or surgery, functionality of the nerve may be compromised, causing the nerve to no longer carry the signals to and from the brain to the muscles and skin. This type of injury generally requires a surgical repair. The traditional gold standard has been to either suture the nerve ends together directly without tension or to bridge the gap between the nerve ends with a less important nerve surgically removed from elsewhere in the patient&#8217;s own body referred to as nerve autograft. In addition, compression on a nerve or blunt force trauma can cause nerve injuries that alter the signal conduction of the nerve and may require surgical intervention. 

&#160; 

In order to improve the options available for the surgical repair and regeneration of peripheral nerves, AxoGen has developed and licensed regenerative medicine technologies. AxoGen&#8217;s innovative approach to regenerative medicine has resulted in first-in-class products that it believes are redefining the peripheral nerve repair market. AxoGen&#8217;s products are used by surgeons during surgical interventions to repair a wide variety of nerve injuries throughout the body. These injuries range from a simple laceration of a finger to a complex brachial plexus injury (an injury to the network of nerves that originate in the neck) as well as nerve injuries caused by dental and other surgical procedures. Avance &#174; Nerve Graft provides surgeons an implant with the micro-architecture of a human nerve. This structure is essential and allows for bridging nerve gaps or discontinuities up to 70mm in length. Additionally, Avance &#174; Nerve Graft has product and sales synergies with AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector. AxoGuard &#174; products provide the unique features of pliability, suturability, and translucence for visualization of the underlying nerve, while also allowing the patient&#8217;s own cells to incorporate into the extracellular matrix to remodel and form a tissue similar to the outermost layer of the nerve (nerve epineurium). 

&#160; 

Regenerative Medical Products Industry 

&#160; 

Regenerative medical products enable the repair, restoration, replacement or regeneration of tissue or organ systems of the body. Regenerative medical products are becoming common in various medical arenas because they have been shown to be effective repairing injured or defective tissues, such as bone, tendons, dermis and other tissues of the body. Surgeons utilize regenerative medical products because they can provide the complex structure required for implant integration and regeneration in the body. 

&#160; 

We believe the primary driver of sustained growth in the regenerative medical product market is continued favorable efficacy as compared to autograft tissue and synthetic medical products, and a wider understanding of this advantage by practitioners. Repair with nerve autograft requires a secondary recovery procedure to remove tissue from another location of the patient&#8217;s body to repair the injured area and results in loss of function at the site of donation. 

&#160;

Further, nerve autograft may also be costly and time consuming and may result in complications at the second surgical site such as infection. In addition to processed nerve allograft (Avance &#174; Nerve Graft), alternatives to nerve autograft include hollow-tube synthetic or collagen-based medical products that are designed to provide some restoration of function but may be limited by mechanisms of nerve healing and/or biocompatibility with the body. Regenerative medical products often provide more desirable conditions for reconstruction and regeneration of tissue, creating a superior solution for patients and physicians. AxoGen follows this trend, providing regenerative medical products for peripheral nerve repair. 

&#160; 

Regenerative medicine products typically consist of and rely on: 

&#160; 

i. 

A scaffold or ECM to support the cells and/or provide the architecture of the tissue: and/or 

ii. 

Cells to regenerate or recellularize the scaffold. 

&#160; 

AxoGen&#8217;s regenerative products are scaffolds, and the patients&#8217; own body provides the cells to regenerate or recellularize these scaffolds. 

&#160; 

Peripheral Nerves and Their Regeneration 

&#160; 

The peripheral nervous system, or PNS, consists of nerves that either extend outside of, or reside outside of, the central nervous system (primarily the brain and spinal cord). Peripheral nerves provide the pathway for signals between the central nervous system and target organs, regulating movement (motor nerves) and touch (sensory nerves). Therefore, if a peripheral nerve is crushed, severed, or otherwise damaged, its ability to deliver signals to the target organs is eliminated, or significantly reduced, and could result in a loss of sensation and/or functionality. The axon portion of the nerve cell, consisting of cell cytoplasm and resembling a hair-like fiber, carries signals from the cell body to the target organ. Axons can be quite long, even exceeding one meter, but are only a few micrometers in diameter. A typical nerve consists of hundreds of axons that lie within long, thin tubes (endoneurial tubes). Analogous to a wiring cable, these endoneurial tubes are bundled together in groups called fascicles, and each nerve may contain numerous fascicles. This sheath structure provides protection for the axons and support for regeneration in the event of injury. Nerve injury occurs when a sufficient number of axons have been crushed or transected (severed), thereby disrupting signals to the target motor or sensory organ. 

&#160; 

Given the right conditions, peripheral nerves have the ability to regenerate. Regenerating axons require the proper environmental conditions including structure and guidance of axons in a tension and compression free environment. In an untreated severe crush injury or transected nerve, errant axons that are not guided by the nerve sheath structure, or other mechanism, can form painful and ineffective nerve proliferation (neuromas). This can then require revision surgery to relieve pain or bring back sensory and/or motor functionality. Therefore, the surgical treatment of nerve injuries is typically focused on restoring nerve functionality by providing structural guidance to regenerating axons while protecting the nerve to alleviate compression and tension. 

&#160; 

Peripheral Nerve Regeneration Market Overview 

&#160; 

Peripheral nerve injury (&#8220;PNI&#8221;) is a major source of disability impairing the ability to move muscles or to feel normal sensations. Failure to treat nerve damage can, in severe cases, lead to full loss of sensation and/or function, pain and, sometimes, amputation. Many peripheral nerve injury patients who receive treatment do not optimally recover. They may suffer from both reduced, or no, muscle strength, and reduced, or no, sensitivity and pain. 

&#160; 

Every day patients suffer traumatic wounds to peripheral nerves severe enough to require surgical treatment, including injuries from motor vehicle accidents, power tool injuries, gun shot wounds, dislocations, fractures, lacerations, or other forms of penetrating trauma. The peripheral nerves commonly injured from these traumas include the digital, median, ulnar, radial, facial, spinal accessory and brachial plexus nerves. Traumatic PNI described herein, and excluding Oral and Carpal Tunnel defined below, is referred to by AxoGen as occurring in the &#8220;Extremity&#8221; PNI market. 

&#160; 

Beyond traumatic injury to nerves described above, nerve damage also occurs due to surgical intervention. Some of these surgical nerve injuries can occur during dental and oral surgery procedures such as third molar extractions, 

&#160;

placement of dental implants and removal of tumors during which an injury may be caused to one or more sections of the trigeminal nerve (&#8220;Oral&#8221;). This can result in numbness in certain areas of the face and mouth. Finally, nerves are also damaged or compromised due to compression injuries. For instance, severe and recurrent carpal tunnel cases may result in complications and damage to the nerve that requires surgical intervention and protection of the nerve. We refer to PNI caused by carpal tunnel syndrome as &#8220;Carpal Tunnel&#8221;. Additional surgical procedures where nerves can be injured include the removal of cancerous tissues or reconstructive surgery . For example, nerves may be injured or removed during a radical prostatectomy to remove prostate cancer and this nerve injury may result in impotence and incontinence. Further, breast cancer patients may have reduced sensation in the tissue used to reconstruct the breast after mastectomy. 

&#160; 

In the cases where a nerve is severed and the gap between the two ends of the nerve is extremely small, the surgeon may be able to reconnect the nerve without tension through direct suturing using a coaptation aid (&#8220;Primary Repair&#8221;). When the gap in the nerve tissue is more than a few millimeters in length, the surgeon typically needs to use material to bridge the gap between the nerve ends to ensure a tension-free repair (&#8220;Gap Repair&#8221;). Historically for a Gap Repair surgeons have relied on a nerve autotransplantation (autologous nerve grafting or nerve autograft). In nerve autograft procedures, surgeons remove nerve from another part of the patient&#8217;s body, frequently the sural nerve from the back of the lower leg, to repair the damaged nerve. Nerve autografting is often effective in repairing a damaged peripheral nerve, but it presents a tradeoff &#8212; the surgeon can attempt to fix the damaged nerve but must create an additional nerve deficit at another location in the body. For example, a patient may opt to get movement and feeling back in their finger while losing some sensation in their foot. Additionally, the secondary surgery to obtain the needed nerve autograft also increases operating time, and thus medical expenses, and increases the risk of surgical site infection and other complications. In the case of extreme trauma where multiple nerves need to be repaired, it may not be possible to recover enough nerve from the patient to complete the Gap Repair. Further, nerve autograft tissue may not provide an appropriate diameter match with the diameter of the injured nerve stump, an important factor in a successful repair outcome. 

&#160; 

Drawbacks of repair with autograft nerve eventually led to the development of hollow tube conduits, or hollow tube nerve cuffs for Primary and Gap Repair made of, for instance, bovine collagen or polyglycolic acid. The nerve cuff is typically an absorbable hollow tube that, unlike natural peripheral nerve, does not have internal microarchitecture and endoneurial tubes to support regenerating axons; as a result, it is deficient in the qualities that natural nerve possesses to support nerve regeneration across a gap. Hollow-tubes may also lack pliability and structural integrity needed when used around joints and may be difficult to use in a confined space. Clinical data has demonstrated that hollow tubes are most effective when used in very short gaps, what AxoGen defines as Primary Repair, and the reliability of successful nerve recovery diminishes as gap length increases. 

&#160; 

The shortcomings of hollow-tubes for nerve repair limit where they may be used effectively. Thus, AxoGen believes the nerve repair market needs an alternative off-the-shelf product that offer other features such as a natural ECM scaffold and three-dimensional structure of a typical nerve for bridging nerve discontinuities without the comorbidities of an additional surgical site required for harvest of autograft nerve tissue. AxoGen believes its Avance &#174; Nerve Graft and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector products address the market needs for both Gap and Primary Repair. 

&#160; 

Compression on a nerve or blunt force trauma can also cause nerve injuries that may require surgical intervention. In these cases, the nerve is not severed and thus does not create the need for a Primary or Gap Repair. However, the surgeon may want to protect and isolate the nerve during the healing process. In these situations nerve protection is provided by wrapping the nerve (&#8220;Nerve Protection&#8221;). 

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector is a porcine submucosa extracellular matrix used for Nerve Protection. Other Nerve Protection products are usually made from bovine collagen or polyglycolic acid and are typically absorbable. AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector provides the unique features of pliability, suturability, and translucence for visualization of the underlying nerve, while also allowing the patient&#8217;s own cells to incorporate into the extracellular matrix to remodel and separate the nerve from the surrounding tissue. 

&#160; 

Based on estimates prepared by AxoGen, it believes the United States PNI market for its current product portfolio for Extremity, Oral and Carpal Tunnel Revision is $1.6 billion (the &#8220;Market&#8221;). We estimate that the Extremity portion 

&#160;

of the Market is approximately $1.3 billion. The estimated size of the Extremity portion of the market is based upon epidemiological studies regarding the general number of trauma patients, physician interviews and incidence of PNI in the population. AxoGen believes each year in the U.S. more than 1.4 million people suffer traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves. AxoGen estimates that traumatic and non-traumatic injuries to peripheral nerves result in over 700,000 extremity nerve repair procedures (&#8220;Health&#8221;, United States, 2011, Publication of U.S. Department of Health &#38; Human Services; Noble, et al. J of Trauma Injury Infection and Critical Care 1998; Kurt Brattain, MD, Magellan Medical Technology Consultants, Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota 2013). AxoGen further estimated the portion of extremity nerve repair procedures that would be addressed by AxoGen&#8217;s Gap Repair, Primary Repair and Nerve Protection products and applied the average sales price of the AxoGen product appropriate to the procedure (Avance &#174; Nerve Graft, AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector, respectively). As a result, AxoGen estimates that the market sizes, within the Extremity portion of the Market, for our Avance &#174; Nerve Graft, AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector products are approximately $668 million, $161 million and $483 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

AxoGen estimates that the Oral portion of the Market is approximately $129 million of the Market, based upon research that has indicated approximately 68,000 PNI occur in the U.S. each year that are related to third molar extractions, anesthetic injections and dental implants. (The Prophylactic Extraction of Third Molars: A Public Health Hazard: Jay W. Friedman, DDS, Health Policy and Ethics; Peer Reviewed; Friedman American Journal of Public Health; September 2007, Vol 97, No. 9, pp 1554 &#8212; 1559 &#8212; Journal of Oral Implantology, Vol. XXXVI/No. Five/2010; &#8220;Inferior Alveolar Nerve Injury in Implant Dentistry: Diagnosis, Causes, Prevention, and Management&#8221;; Ahmed Ali Alhassani, BDS - &#8220;Nerve Injuries after Dental Injection: A Review of the Literature&#8221;; Clinical Practice, July/August 2006, Vol. 72, No. 6, Miller H. Smith, BMedSc, DDS; Kevin E. Lung, BSc, DDS, MSc, FRCD(C)). AxoGen has applied the average sales price of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector that address Oral PNI in order to derive the Oral portion of the Market. 

&#160; 

AxoGen estimates that the Carpal Tunnel portion of the Market is approximately $160 million. According to literature, there are approximately 500,000 carpal tunnel relief surgeries performed annually in the U.S., and AxoGen assumes that 20% of such surgeries require revision procedures to address the recurrence of symptoms (&#8220;Vein-Graft Wrapping for the Treatment of Recurrent Compression of the Median Nerve&#8221;, Microsurgery 16:752-756 1995, Dean G. Sotereanos, M.D.). As a result, AxoGen estimates that approximately 100,000 carpal tunnel revision surgeries are performed each year in the U.S. to address the recurrence of symptoms. These revision surgeries are required due to compression of the nerve due to soft tissue attachments from the surrounding tissue or tissue infiltration entrapping the nerve. To prevent additional recurrences, surgeons will opt to use a Nerve Protection product such as the AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector. In order to derive the Carpal Tunnel portion of the Market, AxoGen multiplied the average sales price of our AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector by the number of estimated carpal tunnel revisions. 

&#160; 

AxoGen continues to look at expansion markets beyond those that AxoGen has defined as Extremity, Oral and Carpal Tunnel. In addition to these areas, AxoGen believes a market exists to treat nerves that are severed during the removal of both benign and cancerous tumors. For example, nerves may be injured or removed during a surgical prostatectomy to remove prostate cancer resulting in impotence and incontinence. Further, a patient who receives repair of peripheral nerves in the breast following a mastectomy and reconstruction, may avoid the reduced sensation typically experienced by many breast cancer patients. AxoGen believes that we will continue to identify market expansion opportunities for our current product portfolio.

&#160; 

Overview of AxoGen&#8217;s Products 

&#160; 

AxoGen&#8217;s proprietary products and technologies are designed to overcome fundamental challenges in nerve repair. AxoGen&#8217;s Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is the alternative to autografts and other off-the-shelf nerve repair products for nerve gaps up to 70mm in length. AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector is a coaptation aid for transected nerve injuries. AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector completes the surgical repair portion of the product portfolio and is a protective wrap for nerves damaged by compression, or where the surgeon wants to protect and isolate the nerve during the healing process after 

&#160;

surgery. The AxoGen surgical repair product portfolio, depicted below, provides surgeons off-the-shelf solutions for a wide variety of peripheral nerve injuries. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Functional measurements play an important role in the evaluation of nerve function. It assists the healthcare professionals in detecting changes in sensation or muscle strength , assessing return of sensory or motor function, establishing effective treatment interventions, and providing feedback to the patients &#160; Standardized evaluation and measurement of nerve function is also an important part of identifying nerve injuries and determining treatment outcomes. AxoGen&#8217;s functional measurement products include the AxoTouch&#8482; Two-Point Discriminator tool (for sensory function) and the AcroVal&#8482; Neurosensory and Motor Testing System (for sensory and motor function) which will be launched in March 2016 . 

&#160; 

Avance &#174; Nerve Graft 

&#160; 

Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is intended for the surgical repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities to support regeneration across the defect (a gap created when the nerve is severed). It is intended to act as a bridge in order to guide and structurally support axonal regeneration across a nerve gap caused by traumatic injury or surgical intervention. Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is decellularized and sterile extracellular matrix (ECM) processed from human peripheral nerve tissue. AxoGen developed the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft by following the guiding principle that the human body created the optimal nerve structure. AxoGen, through its licensing efforts and research, developed the Avance &#174; process, a proprietary method for processing recovered human peripheral nerve tissue in a manner that preserves the essential structure of the ECM while cleansing away cellular and noncellular debris. Avance &#174; Nerve Graft provides the natural nerve structure of an autograft and the ease and availability of an off-the-shelf product. AxoGen believes that Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is the first off-the-shelf human nerve allograft for bridging nerve discontinuities. Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is comprised of bundles of small diameter endoneurial tubes that are held together by an outer sheath called the epineurium. Avance &#174; Nerve Graft has been processed to remove cellular and noncellular factors such as cells, fat, blood, axonal debris and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, (&#8220;CSPG&#8221;), while preserving the three-dimensional laminin lined tubular bioscaffold (i.e. microarchitecture), epineurium and microvasculature of the peripheral nerve. After processing, Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is flexible and pliable, and its epineurium can be sutured in place allowing for tension-free approximation of the proximal and distal peripheral nerve stumps. The design results in a product that has clean and clear pathways for the regenerating axons to grow through. During the healing process, the body revascularizes and gradually remodels the graft into the patient&#8217;s own tissue while allowing the processed nerve allograft to physically support axonal regeneration across the nerve discontinuity. 

&#160; 

&#160;

With lengths up to 70 mm and diameters up to 5 mm, the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft allows surgeons to choose the correct length for repairing the relevant nerve gap, as well as to match the diameter to the proximal and distal end of the severed nerve. The Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is stored frozen and utilizes packaging that maintains the graft in a sterile condition. The packaging is typical for medical products so the surgical staff is familiar with opening the package for transfer of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft into the sterile surgical field. Such packaging also provides protection during shipment and storage and a reservoir for the addition of sterile fluid to aid in thawing the product. The Avance &#174; Nerve Graft thaws in less than 10 minutes, and once thawed, it is ready for implantation. 

&#160; 

The Avance &#174; Nerve Graft provides the following key advantages: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

A three-dimensional bioscaffold for bridging a nerve gap; 

&#183;

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector 

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector is a coaptation aid used to align and connect severed nerve ends in a tensionless repair. The product is in a tubular shape with an open lumen on each end where the severed nerve ends are placed. It is typically used when the gap between the nerve ends is less than 5mm in length. AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector is made from a minimally processed porcine ECM which allows the body&#8217;s natural healing process to repair the nerve while its tube shape isolates and protects the injured nerves during the healing process. During healing, the material revascularizes and the patient&#8217;s own cells incorporate into the extracellular matrix product to remodel and form a tissue similar to the outermost layer of the nerve (nerve epineurium). AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector is provided sterile, for single use only, and in a variety of sizes to meet the surgeon&#8217;s needs. 

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector can be used: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

As an alternative to direct suture repair; 

&#183; 

To relieve tension at the coaptation site of severed nerves; 

&#183; 

To a id coaptation in direct repair, grafting, or cable grafting repairs; 

&#183; 

To reduce the risk of forced fascicular mismatch; and 

&#183; 

To reinforce the coaptation site. 

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector has the following advantages: 

&#160;

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector 

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector is a product used to protect and wrap injured peripheral nerves and reinforce reconstructed nerve gaps while preventing soft tissue attachments. It is designed to protect and isolate the nerve during the healing process after surgery by creating a barrier between the nerve tissue and the surrounding tissue bed. The product is delivered in a slit tube format allowing it to be wrapped around nerve structures. AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector is made from a minimally processed porcine ECM. During healing, the material revascularizes and the patient&#8217;s own cells incorporate into the extracellular matrix product to remodel and separate the nerve from the surrounding tissue. AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector competes against off-the-shelf biomaterials such as reconstituted collagen as well as the use of the patients own tissue such as vein and hypothenar fat pad wrapping. AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector is provided sterile, for single use only, and in a variety of sizes to meet the surgeon&#8217;s needs. 

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector can be used to:

&#160; 

AcroVal&#8482; Neurosensory and Motor Testing System 

&#160; 

AcroVal TM Neurosensory and Motor Testing System is a device for evaluating patients with peripheral nerve conditions. We believe that an important step for improving patient outcomes is to support the standardized evaluation and measurement of nerve function. Today there is little consistency of measurement protocols. With the AcroVal&#8482; system examiners will have digital, less subjective results for their patients with conditions like peripheral neuropathy, nerve compression syndromes, and transected nerves. Ultimately, we believe that standardization of evaluation and measurement techniques will facilitate comparison and interpretation of clinical results leading to better understanding and care for patients with peripheral nerve conditions. 

&#160; 

Dr. A. Lee Dellon, a w orld-renowned peripheral nerve expert, developed the nerve functional evaluation and measurement system over 25 years ago. We acquired the rights to his device in 201 5 and will launch the product in 

&#160;

March 2016 . The AcroVal&#8482; consists of three different devices designed to evaluate hand strength and neurosensory function: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AcroGrip &#8482; - hand grip strength measurement ; 

&#183; 

AcroPinch &#8482; &#8211; pinch strength measurement ; and 

&#183; 

Pressure-Specified Sensory Device&#8482; (PSSD) &#8211; somatosensory evaluation and measurement device 

&#160; 

AcroVal&#8482; can be used to assist healthcare professionals : 

&#160; 

&#183; 

In detecting changes in sensation, pinch strength or grip strength; 

&#183; 

Assessing return of sensory or motor function; 

&#183; 

Establishing effective treatment interventions; and 

&#183; 

Providing feedback to patients. 

&#160; 

AcroVal&#8482; has the following advantages: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Quantitative, e lectronic pre and post-intervention results; 

&#183; 

Flexible format to allow for additional measurement devices; 

&#183; 

Assessment of severity of nerve entrapment syndromes; 

&#183; 

Noninvasive; and 

&#183; 

Reference database to provide baseline standards and support patient education . 

&#160; 

AxoTouch TM Two Point Discriminator 

&#160; 

The AxoTouch&#8482; Two-Point Discriminator tool can be used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin. The discs are useful for determining sensation after a nerve injury, following the progression of a repaired nerve, and during the evaluation of a person with a possible nerve injury, such as nerve division or nerve compression. 

&#160; 

The AxoTouch&#8482; Two-Point Discriminator tool is a set of two aluminum discs each containing a series of prongs spaced between 2 to 1 5 millimeters apart. Additionally, 20 and 25 millimeter spacing is provided. A circular depression on either side of the disc allows ease of rotation. The discs can be rotated between a single prong for testing one-point and any of the other spaced prongs for testing two-point intervals. 

&#160;

Tissue Recovery and Processing for Avance &#174; Nerve Graft 

&#160; 

Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Processing Overview 

&#160; 

Over several years, AxoGen has developed the Avance &#174; Process, an advanced and proprietary technique to process the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft from donated peripheral nerve tissue. The Avance &#174; Process requires special training over several months for each manufacturing associate who processes Avance &#174; Nerve Grafts. The processing and manufacturing system for Avance &#174; Nerve Graft has required significant capital investment, and we plan to make additional investments to continually improve our manufacturing and quality assurance processes and systems. 

&#160; 

&#160;

AxoGen&#8217;s Avance &#174; Process, depicted below, consists of several steps, including peripheral nerve tissue recovery and testing, donor medical review and release, processing, packaging, and sterilization to meet or exceed all applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) , state, and international regulations and American Association of Tissue Banks (&#8220;AATB&#8221;) standards. As an FDA registered tissue establishment, AxoGen utilizes both its own personnel and a variety of subcontractors for recovery, storage, testing, processing and sterilization of the donated peripheral nerve tissue. Additionally, independent certified laboratories have been contracted by AxoGen and its subcontractors to perform testing. The safety of Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is supported by donor screening, process validation, process controls, and validated terminal sterilization methods. The AxoGen Quality System has built in redundancies so that each Avance &#174; Nerve Graft released for implantation meets our stringent quality control and product requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Tissue Recovery and Processing 

&#160; 

AxoGen partners with FDA registered tissue establishments and AATB accredited recovery agencies or recovery agencies in compliance with AATB standards to recover human peripheral nerve tissue for Avance &#174; Nerve Graft processing. After consent for donation is obtained, donations are screened and tested in detail for safety in compliance with the federal regulations and AATB standards on communicable disease transmission. AxoGen processes and packages Avance &#174; Nerve Graft using its employees and equipment . &#160; From 2009 until February 2016 this processing and packaging was performed at LifeNet Health, Virginia Beach, Virginia (&#8220;LifeNet Health&#8221;). Business requirements of LifeNet Health led to their need for additional space and they notified AxoGen that AxoGen would need to transition out of the Virginia Beach facility on or before February 27, 2016. On August 6, 2015 Axogen entered into a License and Services Agreement with Community Blood Center (d/b/a Community Tissue Services) (&#8220;CTS&#8221;), Dayton, Ohio, an FDA registered tissue establishment. Processing of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft pursuant to the CTS agreement began in February 2016. &#160; The CTS agreement is for a 5-year term, subject to earlier termination by either party for cause, or after August 6, 2017 without cause, upon 18 months notice. Under the CTS agreement AxoGen pays CTS a facility fee for clean room/manufacturing, storage and office space. CTS also provides services in support of AxoGen&#8217;s manufacturing such as routine sterilization of daily supplies, providing disposable supplies, microbial services and office support. The service fee is based on a per donor batch rate. The CTS facility provides a cost effective, quality controlled and licensed facility . &#160; H owever, AxoGen could reproduce a manufacturing space that would meet its needs if it no longer continued its relationship with CTS. AxoGen&#8217;s processing methods and process controls have been developed and validated to ensure product uniformity and quality. Pursuant to the CTS agreement, AxoGen pays license fees on a monthly basis to CTS which total an annual amount of approximately $416,000. 

&#160; 

Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Packaging 

&#160; 

After processing, each Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is visually inspected and organized by size (length and diameter) into finished product codes. It is then packaged in individual medical grade clamshells and primary packaging. The outer pouch is the primary sterility and moisture barrier. The packaging operation is performed in a controlled environment at CTS. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Sterilization and Labeling 

&#160; 

After being processed and packaged, Avance &#174; Nerve Graft is then irradiated and shipped to its Burleson, Texas distribution facility (the &#8220;Distribution Facility&#8221;). There the product receives its final labels and is released following a final stringent technical and quality review. Orders for Avance &#174; Nerve Graft are placed with AxoGen&#8217;s customer care team and product is packaged and shipped from the Distribution Facility. 

&#160; 

Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Product Release 

&#160; 

The AxoGen Quality System meets the requirements set forth under 21 CFR Part 1271 for Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, including Good Tissue Practices (&#8220;GTP&#8221;) and is compliant with the 21 CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulations (&#8220;QSR&#8221;). AxoGen has established quality procedures for review of tissue recovery, relevant donor medical record review and release to processing that meet or exceed FDA requirements as defined in 21 CFR Part &#160; 1271, state regulations, international regulations and AATB standards. Furthermore, AxoGen utilizes validated processes for the handling of raw material components, environmental control, processing, packaging and terminal sterilization. In addition to ongoing monitoring activities for product conformity to specifications and sterility, product biocompatibility, shipping methods and shelf life have been validated in accordance with applicable industry standards. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing of AxoGen Products Other Than Avance&#174; Nerve Graft 

&#160; 

Manufacturing for the AxoGuard &#174; Product Line 

&#160; 

AxoGuard &#174; is manufactured by Cook Biotech Incorporated, West Lafayette, Indiana (&#8220;Cook Biotech&#8221;), which was established in 1995 to develop and manufacture tissue grafts utilizing porcine extracellular matrix technology. AxoGen decided to expand its portfolio of products and felt that the unique ECM material offered by Cook Biotech provided the combination of properties needed in nerve reconstruction. Cook Biotech&#8217;s ECM material is pliable, capable of being sutured, translucent and allows the patient&#8217;s own cells to incorporate into the extracellular matrix to remodel and form a tissue similar to the nerve&#8217;s epineurium. In August 2008, Cook Biotech entered into an agreement, amended in March 2012, with AxoGen to distribute its product worldwide in the field of the peripheral and central nervous system, but excluding u se of the AxoGuard &#174; product in the oral cavity for endodontic and periodontal applications and oral and maxillofacial surgery solely as they relate to dental, soft or hard tissue repair or reconstruction. The exclusion results in certain areas of AxoGen&#8217;s market expansion into the oral surgery market being limited to the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. 

&#160; 

The Cook Biotech agreement runs through August 27, 2022. It requires certain minimum purchases, although through mutual agreement the parties have not established such minimums and to date have not enforced such provision, and establishes a formula for the transfer cost of the AxoGuard &#174; products. Under the agreement, AxoGen provides purchase orders to Cook Biotech, and Cook Biote ch fulfills the purchase orders . 

&#160; 

Manufacturing for the AcroVal&#8482; Neurosenso ry and Motor Testing System and AxoTouch TM Two Point Discriminator 

&#160; 

The AcroVal&#8482; Neurosensory and Motor Testing System and AxoTouch TM Two Point Discriminator are contract manufactured by Cybernetics Research Laboratories (&#8220;CRL&#8221;), Tucson, Arizona. CRL supplies the AxoTouch unpackaged and it is packaged at the D istribution F acility. 

&#160; 

The AcroVal&#8482; Neurosensory and Motor Testing System and AxoTouch TM Two Point Discriminator are contract manufactured by Cybernetics Research Laboratories (&#8220;CRL&#8221;), Tucson, Arizona. CRL supplies the AxoTouch unpackaged and it is packaged at the Burleson distribution facility. The Company and CRL are finalizing contracting for the AcroVal&#8482;. It is expected that CRL will provide the AcroVal&#8482; to the Company&#8217;s Burleson distribution facility and AxoGen will perform final inspection and package for customer shipment. CRL will provide warranty service on behalf of the Company for the AcroVal&#8482; and maintain certain levels of spare parts inventory for manufacturing and fulfillment of warranty work. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe CRL has capacity to support any future volumes of AcroVal TM and AxoTouch TM . 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

The AxoGen portfolio of nerve repair solutions, consisting of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft, AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector, offers a full range of products for surgical peripheral nerve repair needs. Its AcroVal&#8482; Neurosensory and Motor Testing System and AxoTouch TM Two Point Discriminator evaluation and measurement tools assist healthcare professionals in detecting changes in sensation, assessing return of sensory function, establishing effective treatment interventions, and providing feedback to patients. AxoGen is focused on the developing market of peripheral nerve repair and regeneration, is committed to improving awareness of new surgical peripheral nerve repair options and is advancing evaluation capabilities for nerve issues, as well as building additional scientific and clinical data to assist surgeons and patients in making informed choices. AxoGen believes that there is an opportunity to rethink current approaches to nerve repair and that its approach will solidify its position as a leader in the field of products for peripheral nerve injuries. The following provides the key elements of AxoGen&#8217;s sales and marketing strategy. 

&#160; 

Increase Awareness of AxoGen&#8217;s Products 

&#160; 

Prior to the introduction of AxoGen&#8217;s portfolio of nerve repair products, surgeons had a limited number of options available for the surgical repair of nerve injuries. AxoGen entered the market to improve the standard of care for patients. Unlike other off-the-shelf options, all of AxoGen&#8217;s nerve repair products are composed of an extracellular matrix which remodels into the patient&#8217;s own tissue and provides physical support for the body&#8217;s natural healing process. 

&#160; 

AxoGen intends to increase market share by improving awareness of nerve repair techniques and AxoGen&#8217;s products through the continued use of educational conferences and presentations, surgical resident and fellow training, scientific publications, and a knowledgeable and professional sales team. AxoGen works to increase usage with existing customers as well as expand the overall customer base. AxoGen is focused on plastic reconstructive surgeons and orthopedic and plastic surgeons who perform surgeries on patients suffering traumatic nerve injuries and who perform hand reconstructive surgeries and certain oral surgeons who repair oral nerve injuries. 

&#160; 

Expand Clinical and Scientific Data Regarding the Performance of AxoGen Products 

&#160; 

Generating clinical data is an important component of AxoGen&#8217;s marketing strategy. AxoGen will continue to accept patients in its RANGER &#174; clinical study (defined below in &#8220;Government Regulations&#8221;), a utilization registry of Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. T hree publications and more than 44 scientific conference presentations have been generated to date from the registry. A multicenter prospective randomized comparative pilot study of hollow tube conduits and Avance &#174; Nerve Graft has completed subject enrollment and outcome follow-up. A pivotal multicenter prospective randomized comparative pilot study of hollow tube conduits and Avance &#174; Nerve Graft to support the transition to a BLA has begun enrollment. Case series in digital nerve repair have been published from the Mayo Clinic, Georgetown University Medical Center and Philadelphia Hand Center &#160; and a case series in OMF has been published from UT Southwestern . A number of additional investigator initiated case reports, studies and publications have been completed. A pilot study on the repair of the cavernous nerves in prostate cancer patients has completed enrollment and follow-up at Vanderbilt and data analysis and report are underway. Case series in brachial plexus, military trauma, neurotization of breast reconstruction and compressive neuropathy are also being developed. AxoGen also supports outside research and will continue to work with investigators working on grants with a translational focus. 

&#160; 

Expand the AxoGen Sales Team 

&#160; 

AxoGen provides full sales and distribution services through both a direct sales force and a team of independent distributors. As of December 31, 2015, we had 41 &#160; direct sales professionals and 24 independent distributors. AxoGen 

&#160;

provides support and resources for independent distributors both within and outside the United States and is increasing its direct sales force in selected United States territories. AxoGen provides products to hospitals, surgery centers and military hospitals, calling on plastic reconstructive surgeons and orthopedic and plastic hand surgeons and certain oral surgeons to review the benefits of the AxoGen products. While surgeons make the decision to implant the products in appropriate patients, hospitals make the decision to buy the products from AxoGen. In today&#8217;s budget constrained environment, hospital committees review new technologies for cost effectiveness as well as quality. AxoGen believes that it has been successful in meeting the needs of these hospital committees by demonstrating the cost/benefit of its products and providing a fair value to the hospital. 

&#160; 

AxoGen Strengths 

&#160; 

AxoGen believes that it has the following strengths in the field of nerve repair and regeneration: 

&#160; 

Established Nerve Repair Expertise 

&#160; 

AxoGen has made a significant investment in understanding peripheral nerve anatomy and surgical nerve repair and regeneration. This has been accomplished through interaction with leading academic centers throughout the United States and by striving to build an outstanding internal team of technical and clinical experts. 

&#160; 

Commitment to the Promotion and Education of Best Practices in Peripheral Nerve Repair 

&#160; 

AxoGen has established educational conferences and presentations and surgical resident and fellow training that we believe is positioning us as a leader in providing peripheral nerve repair best practices. The AcroVal TM is a continuation of this commitment as we believe that an important step for improving patient outcomes is to support the standardized evaluation and measurement of nerve function. Ultimately, standardization of evaluation and measurement techniques will facilitate comparison and interpretation of clinical results leading to better understanding and care for patients with peripheral nerve injuries which can be incorporated into our educational programs and materials. 

&#160; 

Surgical Implant Commercialization Experience 

&#160; 

The AxoGen commercialization team consists of sales, marketing, and customer care professionals with backgrounds in the medical device and biotechnology industries. The team has strong experience in the introduction of technologies and has been instrumental in beginning to establish the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft and the AxoGuard &#174; product line as a new standard of care for the surgical treatment of nerve injuries. AxoGen believes it can leverage these capabilities in expanding the commercial success of the current AxoGen products and future product opportunities. 

&#160; 

Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Performance 

&#160; 

AxoGen has worked with leading institutions, researchers and surgeons to support innovation in the field of surgical peripheral nerve repair. We believe AxoGen&#8217;s RANGER &#174; study (defined below in the section entitled &#8220;Government Regulations&#8221;) is the largest multi-center clinical study conducted in peripheral nerve gap repair. AxoGen&#8217;s A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Subject and Evaluator Blinded Comparative Study of Nerve Cuffs and Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Evaluating Recovery Outcomes for the Repair of Nerve Discontinuities (&#8220;RECON&#8221;) study, the phase 3 trial to support its Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;), continues AxoGen&#8217;s clinical work, providing a new multi-center, prospective, randomized, clinical study on the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. (See &#8220;Government Regulations&#8221;). The January, 2012 edition of Microsurgery and November 2012 edition of The Journal of Hand Surgery &#160; and June 2015 edition of Journal of Reconstructive Microsurgery each contain an article summarizing the RANGER &#174; study results. The Brooks et al. publication reported on 55 Avance &#174; Nerve Graft nerve repairs and resulted in meaningful motor and sensory recovery in 87% of nerve discontinuities between 5 and 50 mm. Additionally, no implant related adverse events were reported. (Brooks, D. N., Weber, R. V., Chao, J. D., Rinker, B. D., Zoldos, J., Robichaux, M. R., Ruggeri, S. B., Anderson, K. A., Bonatz, E. E., Wisotsky, S. M., Cho, M. S., Wilson, C., Cooper, E. O., Ingari, J. V., Safa, B., Parrett, B. M. and Buncke, G. M. (2012), Processed nerve allografts for peripheral nerve reconstruction: A multicenter study of utilization and outcomes in sensory, mixed, and motor nerve reconstructions. Microsurgery, 32: 1&#8212;14. doi: 10.1002/micr.20975 and Cho, et al. 2012, J Hand Surg Am 37(11):2340-9). A meta-analysis of available clinical outcomes data from published 

&#160;

papers on the leading synthetic collagen conduit showed meaningful improvement in only 40-74% of cases bridging a gap in the nerve. A similar meta-analysis for nerve autograft reported meaningful improvement in 60-88% of nerve repairs . 

&#160; 

International Opportunity for Product Sales 

&#160; 

AxoGen currently focuses on the U.S. market, with additional foreign sales in Canada, Spain, Austria, United Kingdom, Israel, Greece, Chile , Switzerland and certain other countries. The need for the surgical repair of injured nerves is a global issue. Through its ex-U.S. sales, AxoGen has shown the capability to take its current nerve repair product offering into new geographical markets. AxoGen does not currently have European Union (&#8220;E.U.&#8221;) &#160; wide approval for Avance &#174; Nerve Graft, but the AxoGuard &#174; products have a CE Mark and can be sold in the E.U. and a ffiliated countries . 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

AxoGen believes it provides the most extensive product portfolio for peripheral nerve repair available. Our current development focus is to expand clinical data in both traumatic nerve repair and other surgical applications. Additional product line extensions of the Avance &#174; and AxoGuard &#174; products and other nerve repair products may be developed. In this regard, AxoGen introduced an AxoGuard &#174; Connector line extension in winter 2014 by providing a new longer 15mm product. Our nerve evaluation and measurement tools are further examples of our development activity having lau n ched the AxoTouch TM in the fall of 2014 and launching the AcroVal TM &#160; systems in March 2016. AxoGen works with academic institutions in the expansion of treatments for peripheral nerve and is involved in a number of grants from government agencies related to nerve repair or use of our products and/or technologies. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, AxoGen spent approximately $ 3,237,000 and $3,033,000, respectively, on research and development expenses and recognized grant revenue of $433,000 and $314,000, respectively . 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The medical device and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. As such, AxoGen cannot predict what products may be offered in the future that may compete with AxoGen&#8217;s products. With regard to nerve function evaluation and measurement there are a number of methods and techniques with little consistency of measurement protocols. Currently as to nerve repair products, AxoGen competes primarily against all transected and non-transected nerve repair approaches including direct suture repair, autograft and hollow-tube nerve conduits and materials used to wrap and protect nerve tissue. Because the requirements of the biomaterials used in nerve repair can vary based on the severity and location of the injury, the size and function of the nerve, surgical technique and patient preference, AxoGen&#8217;s nerve repair products compete against both autograft materials (nerve in the case of a bridging repair and vein or fat in the case of a nerve protection repair) and a limited number of off-the-shelf alternatives. Competitive aspects of our products focus on the overall value proposition of our products and their suitability for specific applications and can include composition and structure of the material, ease of use, clinical evidence, handling, and price. AxoGen&#8217;s major competitors for off-the-shelf repair options in hollow-tube conduits and bio-absorbable wraps are the following companies: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Integra LifeSciences Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: IART) (&#8220;Integra&#8221;). Integra offers NeuraGen &#174; , a hollow tube product made from reconstituted bovine collagen and NeuraWrap TM , a reconstituted bovine collagen biomaterial used for nerve wrapping; 

&#183; 

Baxter International, Inc. (NYSE: BAX) (&#8220;Baxter&#8221;). Baxter acquired Synovis which offers Neurotube, a hollow tube made of polyglycolic acid; and 

&#183; 

Stryker Corporation (NYSE: SYK) (&#8220;Stryker&#8221;). Stryker offers the NeuroMatrix and Neuroflex products, both of which are hollow tubes derived from reconstituted bovine collagen and NeuroMend, a reconstituted bovine collage biomaterial used for nerve wrapping. 

&#160; 

AxoGen believes that surgeons use Avance &#174; Nerve Graft because it provides them with the natural three-dimensional structure and familiar handling characteristics of a typical nerve for bridging nerve discontinuities (severed 

&#160;

nerves) without the comorbidities and additional surgical site of an autograft as well as confidence in the performance of the product as a result of the growing body of clinical literature. AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector provide the unique features of pliability, suturability, and translucence for visualization of the underlying nerve while also allowing the patient&#8217;s own cells to incorporate into the extracellular matrix to remodel and form a tissue similar to the outermost layer of the nerve (nerve epineurium). 

&#160; 

AxoGen believes any current or future competitors face the following important barriers to entry as it relates to the market for its nerve repair products. AxoGen&#8217;s intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) , and that of its partners, including patents, patents-pending and know how, is believed to be an important barrier. Additionally, AxoGen has developed knowledge and experience in understanding and meeting FDA regulatory requirements for Avance &#174; Nerve Graft, including having made a substantial investment in conducting the preclinical and clinical testing necessary to support a submission for a FDA BLA. However, due to its limited resources, its smaller size and its relatively early stage, AxoGen believes it may face competitive challenges and barriers that are difficult to overcome and could negatively impact its growth. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

AxoGen relies on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright, as well as other IP laws, to protect IP rights. In addition, AxoGen utilizes license, non-disclosure, and assignment agreements to protect these IP rights. Specifically, AxoGen requires vendors, contract organizations, consultants, advisors and employees to execute nondisclosure agreements. AxoGen also requires consultants, advisors and employees who develop IP to assign to AxoGen any of their rights to all IP conceived in connection with their relationship with AxoGen. 

&#160; 

License Agreements 

&#160; 

AxoGen has entered into license agreements with University of Florida Research Foundation (the &#8220;UFRF&#8221;) and the University of Texas at Austin (&#8220;UTA&#8221;).

The license agreements include both the right to issued patents and patents pending in the U.S. and international markets. The effective term of the license agreements extends through the term of the related patents. In the event of default, licensors may also terminate an agreement (after written notice) if AxoGen fails to cure a breach. The license agreements contain the following key terms: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Payment of annual license maintenance fees, some of which may be credited against future royalty payments; 

&#183; 

Payment of royalty fees of 1%-3% based on net sales of the licensed products, the level depending on the agreement, which may include a minimum quarterly royalty payment with discounts off royalty rates when royalty stacking applies; 

&#183; 

Payment of a percentage of sublicense fees received; 

&#183; 

Reimbursement of certain legal expenses incurred for patent prosecution and defense; and

AxoGen&#8217;s products are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the U.S. and comparable authorities in other countries. In addition, its Avance &#174; Nerve Graft must comply with the standards of the tissue bank industry&#8217;s accrediting organization, the American Association of Tissue Banks. 

&#160; 

AxoGen distributes for Cook Biotech the AxoGuard &#174; product line. Cook Biotech is responsible for the regulatory compliance of the AxoGuard &#174; product line. AxoGuard &#174; products are regulated as medical devices and subject to premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;FD&#38;C Act&#8221;) , 21 CFR Part 820 (&#8220;Quality System Regulation&#8221;) and related laws and regulations. Cook Biotech has obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance from the FDA for the use of porcine (pig) small intestine submucosa for the repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. Cook Biotech has also obtained a 510(k) premarket clearance for the AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector for the repair of peripheral nerve injuries in which there is no gap or where a gap closure is achieved by flexion of the extremity. We sell the 510(k)-cleared device under the trade name AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Protector and AxoGuard &#174; Nerve Connector . 

&#160; 

AxoGen also distributes the AxoTouch&#8482; Two-Point Discriminator. This device that is manufactured for AxoGen and distributed from the Burleson Facility is a Class I device (general controls) that is exempt from premarket notification and the Quality System Regulation requirements except for the Recordkeeping and Complaint file requirements. It is classified by FDA under 21 CFR 882.1200 ( Two-point discriminator, product code: GWI). 

&#160; 

The AcroVal TM line of devices will be manufactured for AxoGen and distributed from the Burleson Facility. The AcroVal TM devices are regulated as medical devices and are subject to premarket notification requirements under section 510(k) of the FD&#38;C Act. The AcroVal TM line of devices includes the AcroGrip TM , AcroPinch TM and PSSD, all of which received 510(k) clearance by the FDA in the 1990&#8217;s. The AcroGrip TM was cleared under the name Digi-Grip Sensor, the AcroPinch TM was cleared as Pinch Sensor and PSSD as the NK Pressure-Specified Sensory Device. 

&#160; 

In 2007, AxoGen began to process and distribute its Avance &#174; Nerve Graft pursuant to Section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR Part 1271 Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue Based Products controls. Such action was based on AxoGen&#8217;s good faith belief that the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft product was a HCT/P tissue product regulated solely under Section 361. From October 2008 through early 2010, AxoGen was in communication with the FDA concerning the regulatory status of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft product. In April 2010, in response to a Request For Designation filed by AxoGen, the FDA determined that the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft was a biologic product that would be reviewed and regulated by CBER under the requirements of S ection 351 of the PHS Act. Section 351 requires, among other things, an approved license to market a biological product. 

&#160; 

AxoGen met with CBER in July 2010 and, between July 2010 and November 2010, provided information to CBER that resulted in the FDA issuing a letter stating the agency&#8217;s intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft assuming that certain conditions are met relating to the transition of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft from regulation as a HCT/P to a biological 

&#160;

product under section 351 of the PHS Act. Specifically, the FDA is permitting the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft to be distributed, subject to FDA enforcement discretion, provided that: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AxoGen transitions to compliance with Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&#38;C Act, the current G ood M anufacturing P ractice , or cGMP, regulations in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and the applicable regulations and standards in 21 CFR Parts 600-610 prior to initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial; designed to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft . 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AxoGen has performed several gap analyses of its quality system for compliance with 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 regulations. The gap analyses have identified areas in which our quality system could improve with respect to compliance to the regulations. The transition is in process and we periodically review the 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 regulations to ensure that we create and implement appropriate changes, including new quality procedures. Through our internal auditing process, we periodically assess our compliance to the regulations. As AxoGen initiates the phase 3 clinical trial and eventual BLA submission, we will retain an external audit firm with experience in auditing to 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 regulations to verify quality system compliance to the regulations. The associated costs for these activities are not material and the Company believes it can appropriately implement all necessary changes . 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AxoGen conduct s a phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety, purity and potency of the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft under a Special Protocol Assessment (&#8220;SPA&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AxoGen and the FDA agreed to the SPA in August 2011 and in accordance with FDA regulations in 21CFR &#167; Part 312, AxoGen submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) to the FDA in April 2013. The IND became effective in March 2015 and the phase 3 clinical trial was initiated in the second quarter of 2015. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AxoGen continues to comply with the regulations and standard for 21 CFR Part 1271 . 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AxoGen was audited by the FDA at its processing facility in March 2013 and March 2015 and its Distribution Facility in October 2015. The quality system was found to be in compliance with 21 CFR Part 1271 and no FDA Form 483 observations were issued. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

AxoGen continues to exercise due diligence in executing its requirements under the transition program. 

&#160; 

AxoGen is working to ensure compliance with the applicable regulations through ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the transition of the quality system to 21 CFR Parts 210/211 and 600-610 regulations with the FDA and through audits for compliance to 21 CFR Part 1271 and amendments to the IND providing updates to the phase III clinical trial. The final determination of regulatory compliance will be made by the FDA during the pre-license inspection as part of the BLA review. If the FDA does not find AxoGen to be in compliance, or if AxoGen is unable to meet the required standards for preclinical studies, clinical studies and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, the approval of the BLA would become impossible or delayed. 

&#160; 

The FDA will end the period of enforcement discretion upon a final determination of AxoGen&#8217;s future BLA submission or if the FDA finds that AxoGen does not meet the conditions for the transition plan, or is not exercising due diligence in executing the transition (e.g., study completion, or BLA submission is neither timely nor adequate). If final action on the BLA is negative or AxoGen is found to not meet the conditions for the transition plan or its execution, AxoGen will not be able to continue to distribute the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. AxoGen continues to work diligently with the FDA and, in this context, continues to distribute Avance&#174; Nerve Graft. 

&#160; 

The BLA application of Avance &#174; Nerve Graft, if approved, will require a potentially substantial user fee payment to the FDA, although certain exemptions, waivers and discounts of the user fees may apply, including certain waivers or discounts for small businesses. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, referred to herein as FDASIA (Public Law 112-144), which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FD&#38;C Act. FDASIA includes the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 which authorizes the FDA to continue to collect the following user fees from applicants who submit certain new drug and biological product applications and supplements: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Application Fee: Each new BLA has a fee required upon submission. In FY 201 6 , this fee for a BLA requiring clinical data is $2,374,200 . The fee is adjusted each year so we cannot provide an accurate estimate of what our fee will be upon submission of our BLA. For small companies (fewer than 500 employees and no other approved biologic product on the market) submitting its first application, a waiver of the application fee is available. AxoGen expects to apply for this waiver for the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft BLA. 

&#183; 

Establishment Fee: Establishment fees (for the place of business where the biologic product is manufactured) are based on the FDA budget divided by the total number of establishments. In FY 201 6, the Establishment Fee is $585,200 . This fee is adjusted each year so we cannot provide an accurate estimate of what our fee will be upon approval of our BLA. AxoGen will have to pay an establishment fee after BLA approval and then pay such fee annually thereafter. 

&#183; 

Product Fee: A product fee is assessed for each strength or potency in which the approved (non-revoked, non-suspended) product is manufactured in final dosage form. The product fee is based on an estimate of the number of products that would be subject to, and for which the companies would pay, product fees. The product fee is determined by dividing the adjusted total fee revenue from product fees by the number of estimated products (based on previous year&#8217;s product fees) subject to the product fee (excluding product fee waivers and reductions granted by the FDA). For FY 2016, the product fee has been established at $114,450. AxoGen may have to pay a Product Fee after BLA approval. AxoGen expects to apply for a product fee waiver for the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. 

&#160; 

FDA &#8212; General 

&#160; 

FDA regulations govern nearly all the activities that AxoGen performs, or that are performed on its behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses. The activities the FDA regulates include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

product design, development and manufacture; 

&#183; 

product safety, testing, labeling and storage; 

&#183; 

pre-clinical testing in animals and in the laboratory; 

&#183; 

clinical investigations in humans; 

&#183; 

premarketing clearance or approval and licensing; 

&#183; 

record-keeping and document-retention procedures; 

&#183; 

advertising and promotion; 

&#183; 

the import and export of products; 

&#183; 

product marketing, sales and distribution; 

&#183; 

post-marketing surveillance and medical device reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries, communicable diseases, device malfunctions or other adverse events; and 

&#183; 

corrective actions, removals and recalls. 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may subject AxoGen to a variety of administrative or judicially-imposed penalties or sanctions and/or prevent it from obtaining or maintaining required approvals, clearances or licenses to manufacture and market its products. Such failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements may subject AxoGen to stringent administrative or judicial actions or sanctions, such as agency refusal to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution of products, injunctions, or civil or criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

FDA&#8217;s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements - Medical Devices 

&#160; 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device distributed commercially in the U.S. requires either a 510(k) premarket notification submission or a Pre-Market Approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) Application to the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes&#8212;Class I, Class II, or Class III&#8212;depending on the degree of risk, the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each medical device and how much is known about the type of device. For devices first intended for marketing after May 28, 1976, pre-market review and clearance by the FDA for Class I and II medical devices is accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure by finding a device substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II device, unless the device is exempt. The majority of Class I medical devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices for which Class II controls are inadequate to assure safety or effectiveness, and novel devices, including devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. Class III devices generally require an approved PMA prior to marketing. 

&#160; 

A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the safety and effectiveness of the device. 

&#160; 

FDA&#8217;s Premarket Approval Requirements - Biologic Products 

&#160; 

Biological Product License Application (BLA) Pathway 

&#160; 

Biological products subject to BLA requirements are approved under the Public Health Service Act. Biological products require FDA approval of a BLA to be marketed. In order to be approved, a BLA must demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate based on results of preclinical studies and clinical trials. A BLA must also contain extensive CMC and other manufacturing information, and the applicant must pass an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP . Satisfaction of FDA approval requirements for biologics typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product. AxoGen cannot be certain that any BLA approvals for its products will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. 

&#160; 

The steps for obtaining FDA approval of a BLA to market a biologic product in the U.S. include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practices regulations; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approval at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated; 

&#183; 

performance of an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in accordance with Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a BLA, which contains detailed information about the CMC for the product, reports of the outcomes and full data sets of the clinical trials, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product; 

&#183; 

satisfactory review of the contents of the BLA by the FDA, including the satisfactory resolution of any questions raised during the review; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 

&#183; 

FDA approval of the BLA including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable. 

&#160; 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The 

&#160;

IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials and or supporting preclinical data as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. In other words, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

&#160; 

Biosimilar Biological Products 

&#160; 

A regulatory approval pathway for biosimilars was established by The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (&#8220;BPCIA&#8221;), as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. An important component of the legislation specified that a manufacturer of a reference biological product would be granted 12 years of exclusive, non-patent market exclusivity before a biosimilar could be approved for marketing in the US. An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to FDA until four years after the approval date of the BLA for the reference biological product. BPCIA provides for an abbreviated licensure process for a biosimilar, i.e. , a biological product that is highly similar to an FDA-approved biological product, known as a reference product, and has no clinically meaningful differences compared to the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. &#160; &#160; At its discretion, the FDA can waive a requirement for any required element in an application for a biosimilar product. In addition, the legislation distinguished approval of a biosimilar from approval of such a product as a substitute for the reference biological products. Where a product is approved as a substitute for the reference biologic, it is considered an interchangeable product. Approval as interchangeable requires that the product is biosimilar and can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient, and if intended for repeat dosing, a demonstration that the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable and reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternating or switching. Interchangeable products can be substituted for a reference product without intervention of the prescribing healthcare provider. Several states are enacting or are considering laws that regulated the use and substitution of biosimilar and interchangeable products. For example, Virginia requires licensure as interchangeable by the FDA for a pharmacist to dispense a biosimilar in place of a prescribed biological product (Virginia &#167; 54.1-3408.04). 

&#160; 

FDA&#8217;s Pre-Approval and Pre-Licensing Requirements 

&#160; 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA generally inspects the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product if it finds that the facility does not appear to be in cGMP compliance. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will either not approve the application or issue a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. The letter will describe specific deficiencies and, when possible, will outline recommended actions the applicant might take to get the application ready for approval. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 

&#160; 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. AxoGen may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in its efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude it from marketing its products. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

&#160; 

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, AxoGen will be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of a BLA, the FDA may require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product&#8217;s safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved BLA are required to keep extensive records, to report certain adverse reactions and production problems such as biologic deviation reports to 

&#160;

the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP regulations as well as the manufacturing conditions of approval set forth in the BLA. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, which imposes certain procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 

&#160; 

Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at AxoGen&#8217;s facilities or at the facilities of its contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct and prevent recurrence of any deficiencies. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product&#8217;s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications. Finally, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of AxoGen products that are currently under development or regulatory activity. 

&#160; 

The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that AxoGen failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, such as issuing a FDA Form 483 notice of inspectional observations, warning letter, or untitled letter, imposing civil money penalties, suspending or delaying issuance of approvals, requiring product recall, imposing a total or partial shutdown of production, withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted, and pursuing product seizures, consent decrees or other injunctive relief, and criminal prosecution through the U.S. Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) . The FDA can also require AxoGen to repair, replace or refund the cost of devices that it manufactured or distributed. If any of these events were to occur, it could materially adversely affect AxoGen&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are required to support a BLA or PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under strict requirements to ensure the protection of human subjects participating in the trial and under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring and safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials for biological products require the submission and FDA acceptance of an IND and clinical trials for medical devices require the submission and FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption application, or IDE, unless the device regulations provide for an exemption from the IDE requirement. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE is approved by the FDA and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the particular clinical trial. If the product is considered a non-significant risk device under FDA regulations, the trial must only be approved by an IRB prior to its initiation. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND or IDE, for significant risk devices. In addition, for these studies, an IRB at each site at which the study is conducted must approve the protocol, subject consent form and any amendments for each site at which the study is conducted. All research subjects must be informed, among other things, about the risks and benefits of the investigational product and provide their informed consent in writing. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials under an IND typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In AxoGen&#8217;s case, AxoGen believes that the Phase 3 clinical trial study for the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft represents the only new clinical data that will be required to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Phase 1 clinical trials usually involve the initial introduction of the investigational product into a small group of healthy volunteers (e.g., 10 to 20) to evaluate the product&#8217;s safety (dosage tolerance and pharmacokinetics if a biologic product) and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a larger but limited patient population (e.g., a few hundred) to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; 

&#160;

&#183; 

identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and 

&#183; 

provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the product for specific indications. 

&#160; 

Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety in an expanded patient population (e.g., a hundred to several thousand). Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve comparison with placebo, standard treatments or other comparators. Usually at least one well-controlled large Phase 3 or pivotal clinical trial demonstrating safety and efficacy is required to support a BLA. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 trials are almost always larger, more time consuming, complex and costly than Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA or AxoGen may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, have experienced a serious and unexpected adverse event, or that continued use in an investigational setting may be unethical. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of research if the research is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the research has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

&#160; 

Investigational New Drug Application 

&#160; 

For a biologic product, an IND must be submitted prior to the initiation of the clinical study. The IND application must contain information in three broad areas: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies - Preclinical data to permit an assessment as to whether the product is reasonably safe for initial testing in humans. Also included are any previous experiences with the product in humans (often foreign use). 

&#183; 

Manufacturing Information - Information pertaining to the composition, manufacturer, stability, and controls used for manufacturing of the drug substance and the drug product. This information is assessed to ensure that the company can adequately produce and supply consistent batches of the drug. 

&#183; 

Clinical Protocols and Investigator Information - Detailed protocols for proposed clinical studies to assess whether the initial-phase trials will expose subjects to unnecessary risks. Also, information on the qualifications of clinical investigators&#8212;professionals (generally physicians) who oversee the administration of the experimental compound&#8212;to assess whether they are qualified to fulfill their clinical trial duties. Finally, commitments to obtain informed consent from the research subjects, to obtain review of the study by an IRB, and to adhere to the investigational new drug regulations. 

&#160; 

Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. During this time, the FDA has an opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk. 

&#160; 

AxoGen Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

AxoGen has an active clinical research program to gather data on the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. AxoGen has completed two clinical studies and is performing two ongoing clinical studies. The ongoing studies are &#8220;A Multicenter Retrospective Study of Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Utilization, Evaluations and Outcomes in Peripheral Nerve Injury Repair (&#8220;RANGER &#174; &#8221;)&#8221; and &#8220;A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Patient and Evaluator Blinded Comparative Study of Nerve Cuffs and Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Evaluating Recovery Outcomes for the Repair of Nerve Discontinuities (&#8220;RECON&#8221;)&#8221;. Completed studies are &#8220;A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Comparative Study of Hollow Nerve Conduit and Avance &#174; Nerve Graft Evaluation Recovery Outcomes of the Nerve Repair in the Hand (&#8220;CHANGE&#8221;)&#8221; and a pilot study to evaluate the use of Avance &#174; Nerve Graft in the reconstruction of nerves following prostatectomy. 

&#160; 

AxoGen will continue to accept patients in the RANGER &#174; clinical study, a utilization registry of Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. Three publications and more than 4 4 scientific conference presentations have been generated to date from the registry. The RANGER &#174; Study is an observational study in current enrollment. It is designed to allow enrollment of up to a total of 1,000 subjects over the next several years. The follow-up for the RANGER &#174; Study is standard of care up to 36 months post nerve repair. At the time of the BLA submission, if 1,000 subjects have not been enrolled and follow-up 

&#160;

completed, AxoGen will submit an interim report in the BLA for the enrolled subjects. In 2013, a Matched Autograft and Tube Conduit Case Control Cohort Arm of RANGER &#174; (&#8220;MATCH&#8221;) comparative arm was added. Subjects treated with Avance &#174; Nerve Graft were matched to the nerve autograft or tube conduit treated groups based on size of gap length. We anticipate having approximately 300 subjects treated with nerve autograft and/or tube conduit in the comparative arm. 

&#160; 

AxoGen has worked with leading institutions, researchers and surgeons to support innovation in the field of surgical peripheral nerve repair. AxoGen believes that RANGER &#174; is currently the largest multi-center observational clinical study conducted in peripheral nerve gap repair. AxoGen&#8217;s ongoing RECON study will also continue our clinical work, providing a new multi-center, prospective, randomized, clinical study on the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. The January 2012 edition of Microsurgery, November 2012 edition of The Journal of Hand Surgery and June 2015 edition of Journal of Reconstructive Microsurgery each contain an article summarizing RANGER &#174; study results (Brooks, et al. Processed nerve allografts for peripheral nerve reconstruction: A multicenter study of utilization and outcomes in sensory, mixed, and motor nerve reconstructions. Microsurgery, 2012 Jan; 32(1): 1-14; and Cho, et al. Functional outcome following nerve repair in the upper extremity using processed nerve allograft. J Hand Surg Am 2012 Nov; 37(11):2340-9 and Rinker, et al. Outcomes of short-gap sensory nerve injuries reconstructed with processed nerve allografts from a multicenter registry study. J Reconstr Microsurg 2015 Jun; 31(5):384-90). Brooks et al. reported on 55 Avance &#174; Nerve Graft nerve repairs and resulted in meaningful motor and sensory recovery in 87% of nerve discontinuities between 5 and 50 mm. Cho et al. showed that Avance &#174; Nerve Graft provided 89% meaningful recovery for digital nerve injuries, and 80% meaningful recovery for motor function in mixed and motor nerve injuries. An expanded data milestone was presented at the 5th Vienna Symposium on Surgery of Peripheral Nerves in June 2014 and such expanded RANGER &#174; data provides that of the injuries repaired with the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft 90%, 80% and 87% achieved meaningful recovery for gap lengths of 5-14 mm, 15-29 mm and 30-65 mm, respectively. Rinker et al. reported on a subgroup from the RANGER &#174; registry on sensory recovery of short-gap digital nerve repairs between 5-15 mm using Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. The study cohort included 24 subjects with 37 digital nerve repairs. Outcomes analysis demonstrated meaningful levels of sensory recovery. No implant related adverse experiences were reported in any of such reports. 

&#160; 

The following describes available clinical outcomes data from published papers on the leading synthetic and collagen conduit. Published papers on the leading synthetic collagen conduit by Weber, et al., 2000 and Wangensteen and Kalliainen, 2009, showed meaningful improvement: 74% in sensory nerves and 43% in sensory, mixed and motor nerves, respectively, of cases bridging a gap in the particular type of nerve. A paper published by Haug, et al., 2013 on the leading synthetic and collagen conduit showed meaningful improvement in 40% sensory nerves using the static 2-point discrimination test. Autograft studies where autograft and direct repair or direct suture were tested by Weber, et al., 2000, Kim and Kline 2001-2006, Frykman and Gramyk, 1991, Frykman and Gramyk, 1991 and Kallio, 1993, as interpreted by Brooks et al. 2012, reported meaningful recovery: 86% in sensory nerves, 67-86% in sensory and mixed nerves, 80% in sensory nerves, 75-78% mixed nerves and 70% sensory nerves, respectively, of cases bridging a gap in the particular type of nerve. Published papers by Kim and Kline 2001-2006 and Frykman and Gramyk, 1991 reported successful recovery in 75% and 78% of mixed and motor nerves, respectively. A study by Kallio et al., 1993 showed recovery in 67% of mixed and motor nerves where recovery was defined as results indicating a classification of useful or better motor and sensory recovery. 

&#160; 

The RECON study will include up to 15 centers and is a prospective, randomized, controlled, patient and evaluator blinded, comparative study of Avance &#174; Nerve Graft and Collagen Nerve Cuffs in the repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities. The study objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of peripheral nerve repair in 150 subjects. Subjects will be followed over the course of 12 months to assess safety and efficacy outcomes with assessments being performed at various defined intervals up to 12 months. The study is currently in early enrollment and no outcome data is available at this time. 

&#160; 

CHANGE was a prospective randomized controlled pilot study of nerve cuffs and Avance &#174; Nerve Graft for the reconstruction of peripheral nerve discontinuities in male and female subjects that sustained injury to at least one nerve in the hand, distal to the superficial palmar arch that after resection resulted in a nerve gap of &#62;5 mm and &#8804;20 mm. The study enrolled a total of 23 patients (14 for Avance &#174; Nerve Graft and 9 for Conduits) with 31 nerve repairs at a total of 4 sites. The study has been completed. 

&#160; 

&#160;

A pilot study on the repair of the cavernous nerves in prostate cancer patients at Vanderbilt with 24 month follow-up has been completed. A total of 12 subjects were enrolled in this single center study. The primary objective of this study was to assess the technical feasibility of using Avance &#174; Nerve Graft for neurovascular bundle (NVB) reconstruction during RALP. The secondary objective of the study was to assess the long term safety and efficacy of NVB reconstruction by assessing quality of life and erectile function through validated questionnaires 24 months post-repair. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. AxoGen&#8217;s clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. AxoGen is also required to obtain the patients&#8217; written informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. AxoGen, the FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the biological product or device, or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S. Similarly, in Europe, the clinical study for a medicine product must be authorized by the Competent Authority in each Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, and must receive a favorable opinion from an ethics committee. 

&#160; 

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation 

&#160; 

There are numerous regulatory requirements that apply after a product is cleared or approved. For medical devices, these include, but are not limited to: the FDA&#8217;s regulations for device labeling (21 CFR Part 801), medical device reporting (21 CFR Part 803), reporting of corrections and removals (21 CFR Part 806), establishment registration and device listing requirements (21 C.F.R. Part 807); and compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) per 21 CFR Part 820. Distribution of medical devices is also subject to license/registration requirements in some states. For tissue and biologic products, the regulatory requirements include: the FDA&#8217;s registration and listing requirements, donor eligibility requirements and compliance with Good Tissue Practices ( &#8220; GTP &#8221; ) in 21 CFR Part1271 for human tissue products, compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP in 21 CFR Parts 210, 211, and 600 for biological products, and postmarket BLA requirements (21 CFR Part 601). Among other things, these regulations require manufacturers, including third &#160; party manufacturers to : 

&#160; 

&#183; 

follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 

&#183; 

comply with labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the false or misleading promotion or the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses or indications; 

&#183; 

comply with requirements to obtain clearance or approval for certain changes affecting the product, including changes to the product&#8217;s manufacturing, labeling, or intended use; 

&#183; 

report to the FDA certain adverse events, adverse reactions and deviations: (a) for medical devices, a report to FDA is required if the device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; (b) for biologics, a deviation from current GMP or an unexpected or unforeseeable event that may affect the safety, purity, or potency of the product must be reported; and (c) for human tissue products, FDA requires reporting of certain adverse reactions involving a communicable disease related to an HCT/P that the company made available for distribution; 

&#183; 

comply with post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments and post-market safety and annual reporting requirements; 

&#183; 

follow post-market surveillance regulations that may apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and 

&#183; 

follow requirements to issue notices of correction or removal, or conduct market withdrawals or recalls where quality or other issues arise. 

&#160; 

AxoGen has not received any reports of adverse events concerning the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft product. Three adverse events have been reported for the AxoGuard &#174; products (one each in 2013, 2014 and 2015). AxoGen has not had to submit any Medical Device Reports (&#8220;MDRs&#8221;), biological deviation reports, or tissue adverse reaction reports to the 

&#160;

FDA. Cook Biotech submitted an MDR for the AxoGuard &#174; adverse events in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Although AxoGen&#8217;s AxoGuard &#174; products have had just three adverse events reported to date, there may have been other incidents, including patient deaths, which may have occurred during procedures utilizing AxoGen&#8217;s products without AxoGen being aware of any such incidents. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the future AxoGen&#8217;s products will not cause or contribute to an adverse event that would require AxoGen to submit MDRs, biological deviation reports, or tissue adverse reaction reports to the FDA. 

&#160; 

The advertising and promotion of medical products are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, some promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the Federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. 

&#160; 

AxoGen is registered with the FDA as a tissue establishment for the Avance &#174; Nerve Graft. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. AxoGen is subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the GTP, GMP and other regulations, and these inspections may also include the manufacturing facilities of suppliers. 

&#160; 

Failure by AxoGen or by AxoGen&#8217;s suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other federal or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions, among others: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 

&#183; 

customer notifications, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; 

&#183; 

operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

&#183; 

suspension or termination of our clinical trials; 

&#183; 

refusing our PMA or BLA for new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products; and 

&#183; 

withdrawing or spending premarket approvals that have already been granted; and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 

&#160; 

Educational Grants 

&#160; 

A medical product manufacturer may provide financial support, including support by way of grants, to third-parties for the purpose of conducting medical educational activities. If these funded activities are considered by the FDA to be independent of the manufacturer, then the activities fall outside the FDA restrictions on promotion to which the manufacturer is subject. 

&#160; 

The FDA considers several factors in determining whether an educational event or activity is independent from the substantive influence of the product manufacturer and therefore non-promotional, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

whether the intent of the funded activity is to present clearly defined educational content, free from commercial influence or bias; 

&#183; 

whether the third &#160; party grant recipient and not the manufacturer has maintained control over selecting the faculty, speakers, audience, program content and materials; 

&#183; 

whether the program focuses on a single product of the manufacturer without a discussion of other relevant existing competitive products or treatment options; 

&#183; 

whether there was meaningful disclosure to the audience, at the time of the program, regarding the manufacturer&#8217;s funding of the program, any significant relationships between the provider, presenters, or speakers and the supporting manufacturer; whether any unapproved uses will be discussed; 

&#160;

&#183; 

whether there are legal, business, or other relationships between the supporting manufacturer and provider or its employees that could permit the supporting manufacturer to exert influence over the content of the program; 

&#183; 

whether the individuals employed by the provider and involved in designing or conducting the educational activities are also involved in advising or assisting the company with respect to sales or marketing; 

&#183; 

whether the information about the company&#8217;s products is further disseminated after the initial program, by or at the direction of the company, other than in response to an unsolicited request or through an independent provider; and 

&#183; 

whether the provider is compliant with standards for independence, balance, objectivity, and scientific rigor when putting on ostensibly independent educational programs. 

&#160; 

AxoGen seeks to ensure that the activities it supports pursuant to educational grants program are in accordance with these criteria for independent educational activities. However, AxoGen cannot provide assurance that the FDA or other government authorities would view the programs supported as being independent. 

&#160; 

Fraud, Abuse and False Claims 

&#160; 

AxoGen is directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;OIG&#8221;) has issued a series of regulations, known as the &#8220;safe harbors.&#8221; These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute for activities that fit within a safe harbor. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG, and are at risk activities unless a favorable advisory opinion is obtained from the OIG. 

&#160; 

The Federal False Claims Act (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. g overnment. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages. The DOJhas previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers included the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors violated the FCA resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid. In certain cases, manufacturers have entered into criminal and civil settlements with the federal government under which they entered into plea agreements, paid substantial monetary amounts and entered into corporate integrity agreements that require, among other things, substantial reporting and remedial actions going forward. 

&#160; 

AdvaMed is one of the primary voluntary U.S. trade associations for medical device manufacturers. This association has established guidelines and protocols for medical device manufacturers in their relationships with healthcare professionals on matters including research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third &#160; party educational conferences, and consulting arrangements. Adoption of the AdvaMed Code by a medical device manufacturer is voluntary, and while the OIG and other federal and state healthcare regulatory agencies encourage its adoption and may look to the AdvaMed Code, they do not view adoption of the AdvaMed Code as proof of compliance with applicable laws. AxoGen has incorporated the principles of the AdvaMed Code in its 

&#160;

standard operating procedures, sales force training programs, and relationships with doctors. Key to the underlying principles of the AdvaMed Code is the need to focus the relationships between manufacturers and healthcare professionals on matters of training, education and scientific research, and limit payments between manufacturers and healthcare professionals to fair market value for legitimate services provided and payment of modest meal, travel and other expenses for a healthcare professional under limited circumstances. AxoGen has incorporated these principles into its relationships with healthcare professionals under its consulting agreements, payment of travel and lodging expenses, research and educational grant procedures and sponsorship of third &#160; party conferences. In addition, AxoGen has conducted training sessions on these principles. Finally, the Sunshine act, as defined below, imposes additional new reporting and disclosure requirements on AxoGen for any &#8220;transfer of value&#8221; made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician ownership interests. AxoGen cannot provide any assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view its relationships with physicians or policies as being in compliance with applicable regulations and laws. 

&#160; 

Regulation Outside of the United States 

&#160; 

Sales of medical products outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign governmental regulations that vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain certification or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval and the requirements may be different. 

&#160; 

There are restrictions under U.S. law on the export from the U.S. of medical devices and biological product that cannot be legally distributed in the U.S. If a Class I or Class II device does not have 510(k) clearance and the manufacturer reasonably believes that the device could obtain 510(k) clearance in the U.S., then the device can be exported to a foreign country for commercial marketing without the submission of any type of export request or prior FDA approval if (i) the device is not sold or offered for sale in the U.S., (ii) is labeled for export only and (iii) satisfies certain criteria relating primarily to specifications of the foreign purchaser and compliance with the laws of the country to which it is being exported, known as Importing Country Criteria. An unapproved Class III device can be exported if it (i) complies with the criteria discussed above for devices that could obtain 510(k) clearance, (ii) meets certain other quality and labeling requirements, and (iii) has a valid marketing authorization from one of a list of countries listed in the FD&#38;C Act. If an unapproved Class III device does not have a valid marketing authorization from one of the listed countries, an export permit from the FDA is required in order to export it. An unapproved biological product can be exported without submitting an export request to FDA if the product has received a marketing authorization in one of a list of countries listed in the FD&#38;C Act and it meets applicable requirements of the FD&#38;C Act and the laws of the country to which it is exported. An investigational biological product may also be exported under an IND if a listed investigator is in a foreign country and certain requirements specified in FDA&#8217;s regulations are met. AxoGen currently complies with applicable regulations when exporting its products and AxoGen intends to continue such compliance in the event there are any regulatory changes regarding its products in the United States. 

&#160; 

The primary regulatory body in Europe is the E.U. which has adopted numerous directives and promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture and labeling of, and clinical trials and adverse event reporting for, medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear CE marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the E.U. and other countries that comply with these directives. The method for assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the device, but normally involves an assessment by the manufacturer and a third &#160; party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third &#160; party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer&#8217;s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer&#8217;s device. Such an assessment is required for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. In the second q uarter of 2014, AxoGen&#8217;s Quality System became registered to ISO 13485 for Receipt, Handling, Storage and Distribution of Medical Devices related to nerve repair. 

&#160; 

Cook Biotech is responsible for all regulatory filings for the AxoGuard products including international registrations. AxoGen works with Cook Biotech by providing the countries for Cook to register or get approval for the AxoGuard &#174; products. Cook Biotech prepares the product filing documentation and submits this documentation to the Ministry of Health (&#8220;MOH&#8221;) for the country. Each country or region has its own regulations and the documentation 

&#160;

required for submission varies. It typically takes less than nine months from the initiation of the project to obtain AxoGuard &#174; clearance in a given country or region. To date, the AxoGuard &#174; product line was registered in May 2013 in Canada for distribution and in April 2013 the product line was awarded the CE Mark allowing distribution into the E .U. &#160; and other countries that accept the CE Mark. 

&#160; 

Tissue products are not currently regulated under the CE Mark 

&#160; 

Although some standards of harmonization exist, each country in which AxoGen conducts business has its own specific regulatory requirements. AxoGen procures and processes its tissue products in the U.S., and markets in the U.S., Canada, Spain, Austria, United Kingdom, Israel, Greece, Chile , Switzerland and certain other countries under compliance with the individual country regulations. These requirements are dynamic in nature and, as such, are continually changing. New regulations may be promulgated at any time and with limited notice. AxoGen will review the regulations at the time of submission of the product dossier for regulatory review. This review involves reviewing the appropriate MOH regulations, discussion with in-country distributors and use of consultants. It typically takes less than nine months from the initiation of the product to develop a product dossier (specific for that country), submission of the documentation and MOH review of the product filing. While AxoGen believes that it is in compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations will not negati vely impact AxoGen&#8217;s operations . 

&#160; 

The FDA and international regulatory bodies conduct periodic compliance inspections of AxoGen&#8217;s U.S. processing facilities. AxoGen&#8217;s operations are registered with the U.S. FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, (CBER), as a tissue establishment. AxoGen is also accredited by the AATB and is licensed in the states of Florida, New York, California, Maryland, Delaware, Oregon and Illinois. AxoGen believes that worldwide regulation of tissue products is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implant products and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of citizen recipients. Changes in governing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on AxoGen&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. AxoGen management further believes that it can help to mitigate this exposure by continuing to work closely with government and industry regulators. 

&#160; 

Environmental 

&#160; 

AxoGen&#8217;s products, as well as the chemicals used in processing, are handled and disposed of in accordance with country-specific, federal, state and local regulations. Since 2007, AxoGen has used outside third parties to perform all biohazard waste disposal. 

&#160; 

AxoGen contracts with independent, third parties to perform sterilization of its allografts. In view of the engagement of a third party to perform irradiation services, the requirements for compliance with radiation hazardous waste do not apply, and therefore AxoGen does not anticipate that having any material adverse effect upon its capital expenditures, results of operations or financial condition. However, AxoGen is responsible for assuring that the service is being performed in accordance with applicable regulations. Although AxoGen believes it is in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations, the failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties, fines and/or sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on AxoGen&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160; 

On September 30, 2011, AxoGen Corporation (&#8220;AC&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, completed its business combination with LecTec Corporation (&#8220;LecTec&#8221;), a Minnesota corporation, in accordance with the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 31, 2011, by and among LecTec, Nerve Merger Sub Corp., a subsidiary of LecTec (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), and AC, which the parties amended on August 9, 2011 and September 30, 2011 (as amended, the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into AC, with AC continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of LecTec (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). Immediately following the Merger, LecTec changed its name to AxoGen, Inc. In October 2011, AxoGen Inc. moved its corporate headquarter facilities (principal executive office) from Texarkana, Texas to Alachua, Florida. 

&#160; 

LecTec was organized in 1977 as a Minnesota corporation and went public in December 1986. Prior to the Merger it was an intellectual property licensing and holding company. LecTec held multiple domestic and international patents based on its original hydrogel patch technology and filed patent applications on a hand sanitizer patch. LecTec also had a licensing agreement with Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. LecTec took legal action to protect its IP and settled all of its litigation prior to the Merger and AxoGen subsequent to the Merger continued to hold LecTec IP until it expired. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, AxoGen had 113 full time employees which included 10 in administration, information technology and finance, 16 in manufacturing and quality control, 13 in research and development and regulatory and 74 in sales and marketing. As of the date of this Form 10-K AxoGen has not had a work stoppage and no employees are represented by a labor union. AxoGen believes its relationship with its employees is satisfactory.
