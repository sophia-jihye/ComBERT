 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

Revance Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology &#32; company focused on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of novel botulinum toxin products for multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications. We are leveraging our proprietary portfolio of botulinum toxin type A compounds, combined with our patented TransMTS&#174; peptide delivery system, to address unmet needs in large and growing neurotoxin markets. Our proprietary TransMTS technology enables delivery of botulinum toxin type A through two investigational drug product candidates, DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical Gel (RT001), or RT001 topical, and DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002), or RT002 injectable. We are pursuing clinical development for RT001 topical and RT002 injectable in a broad spectrum of aesthetic and therapeutic indications. Neither formulation of our product candidates contains albumin or any other animal or human-derived materials. We believe this reduces the risk of the transmission of certain viral diseases. We hold worldwide rights for all indications of RT001 topical, RT002 injectable, and our TransMTS technology platform. 

RT001 topical has the potential to be the first commercially available non-injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A. We are studying RT001 topical for aesthetic indications, such as crow's feet (wrinkles around the eyes, also known as lateral canthal lines), and therapeutic indications, such as axillary hyperhidrosis (underarm excessive sweating). RT002 injectable is a novel, injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A designed to be a targeted and long-lasting injectable botulinum toxin treatment. We are studying RT002 injectable for aesthetic indications, such as glabellar (frown) lines and therapeutic indications, such as cervical dystonia. We believe both product candidates have the potential to expand into additional aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the future.

Our Product Candidates 

DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002) or RT002 Injectable 

We are developing an injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A, which we refer to as RT002 injectable, for indications where deep delivery of the botulinum toxin is required and a long-lasting effect is desired. We believe RT002 injectable may provide a targeted delivery of botulinum toxin to intended treatment sites while potentially reducing the unwanted spread of botulinum toxin to adjacent areas. We believe, and our preclinical and clinical studies indicate, that this targeted delivery, enabled by our proprietary peptide technology, may permit safe administration of higher doses of botulinum toxin and may result in long-lasting effect. We are initially focused on developing RT002 for the treatment of glabellar lines and cervical dystonia. 

Glabellar Lines 

Glabellar lines are the result of gathering the tissue between the eyebrows into a fold. They are caused by the repeated action of underlying muscles associated with facial expression. Years of squinting and frowning tend to leave deep wrinkles in the skin between the eyebrows and on the bridge of the nose, across the forehead and at the corners of the eyes. On many people, frown lines produce an angry or sad look that detracts from a pleasant facial appearance. Physical, emotional and social reasons for treating frown lines and forehead furrows include improved appearance and enhanced self-esteem. The most common cosmetic use of the market leader, BOTOX&#174; Cosmetic is for the treatment of glabellar lines. In general, consumers enjoy the benefits of botulinum toxin injections and there is a high rate of satisfaction. Longevity, or duration of effect, is the one area where consumers are less satisfied and desire longer duration. 

Botulinum toxin treatment of glabellar lines is the largest proportion of cosmetic neurotoxin sales in the United States and, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, botulinum toxin treatment is the number one nonsurgical cosmetic procedure in the United States. We believe RT002 injectable has the potential to satisfy significant unmet needs in this market. According to market research we conducted in April 2015, which involved a quantitative study with eighty dermatologists and plastic surgeons, 60% of the physicians surveyed stated that longer duration is a significant unmet need in the market for the botulinum toxin treatment of glabellar lines and 75% stated that they are likely or very likely to use RT002 injectable based on both injectable data available during the study and the RT002 injectable product concept. 

Also, primary market research among over 30 leading aesthetic physicians indicated that they were very impressed by the clinical data generated in the RT002 Phase 1/2 study. In fact, those physicians reported that if RT002 injectable demonstrated similar results in larger trials the increased duration of effect would cause them to change their treatment habits from currently available botulinum toxins to RT002 injectable. While potentially increased safety due to decreased spread to adjacent muscles was an appealing benefit in cosmetic indications, duration of effect was reported to be the primary driver of adoption. 

We believe that a product that still shows meaningful consumer benefit at six months would fit very nicely into the current treatment regimen and consumer habits. Most consumers only visit their physicians twice per year for treatments and the longer duration would mean that they would remain satisfied between treatments. Additionally, a longer lasting botulinum toxin product may align more closely with the duration of dermal filler treatments, which often are administered at the same time as botulinum toxin treatments. 

We believe that RT002 injectable may provide the following benefits to patients and physicians for treatment of glabellar lines, as compared to the market leader, BOTOX&#174; Cosmetic: 

&#8226; 

RT002 injectable may permit longer lasting effect of 6 months. 

&#8226; 

RT002 injectable may provide targeted delivery of botulinum toxin to intended treatment sites while potentially reducing the unwanted spread of botulinum toxin to adjacent areas. &#32;&#32;This could potentially decrease unwanted side effects like eyelid ptosis (droopy eyelids) and patient dissatisfaction. 

We believe that RT002 injectable may provide the following benefits to physicians: 

&#8226; 

RT002 injectable may be simple to use and consistent with administration of currently available marketed products. &#32;&#32;Minimal training is required because administration would be similar to currently available marketed products. 

&#8226; 

RT002 injectable may lead to more sustained patient satisfaction between treatments, which is critical for self-pay procedures. 

&#8226; 

RT002 injectable could potentially expand their practices by appealing to consumers (particularly men) who are not willing to come in multiple times per year to sustain the benefits of treatment. 

&#8226; 

Physicians may be willing to pay more for RT002 injectable compared to currently available neurotoxins as they believe that they could easily pass that cost along to their patients, who would be willing to pay for increased duration of effect. 

&#8226; 

In phase 2 studies, RT002 injectable appeared to be well-tolerated with no significant safety concerns. 

Development of RT002 Injectable for Treatment of Glabellar Lines 

Phase 1 and 2 Clinical Trials. &#32;&#32;We believe RT002 injectable may provide targeted delivery of botulinum toxin to intended treatment sites while reducing the unwanted spread of botulinum toxin to adjacent areas. We believe this could permit long-lasting effect and safe administration of botulinum toxin, even with higher targeted doses. These properties, longer lasting effect and reduced spread of botulinum toxin, have been demonstrated in a four-cohort Phase 1/2 clinical dose escalation trial outside the United States for improvement of glabellar lines. In the study, RT002 injectable met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints. The open-label, dose escalating, Phase 1/2 study enrolled 48 adults in four cohorts. All subjects had Severe or Moderate wrinkles at baseline, measured using the 4-point Global Line Severity Scale (GLSS). In summary, the data showed: 

&#8226; 

96% of subjects were rated with None or Mild wrinkle severity at maximum frown 4 weeks post-treatment using the GLSS as assessed by the clinical investigator. 

&#8226; 

83% of subjects assessed themselves as achieving None or Mild wrinkles at maximum frown at the same time point. 

&#8226; 

In the final cohort, the only one where duration of effect was measured, RT002 injectable achieved a median duration of 29.4 weeks or seven months based on both investigator and subject assessments. 

&#8226; 

In this final cohort, 60% of subjects maintained None or Mild wrinkle severity at 6 months. 

&#8226; 

RT002 injectable was well-tolerated, and there was no evidence of spread beyond the treatment site at any dose; additionally, adverse event rates did not change in frequency, severity, or type with increasing doses. 

RT002 appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated with minimal adverse events in our Phase 1/2 trial. Adverse events were generally mild, localized and transient. The most common adverse events observed were headache and injection site reactions. There was no evidence of spread beyond the treatment site at any dose. There were no serious adverse events or evidence of any systemic exposure based on clinical laboratory results and related evaluations. Adverse event rates did not change in frequency, severity, or type with increasing doses. 

Based on the results of this study, Revance initiated BELMONT, a Phase 2, Randomized, Double- B lind, Dos E &#32;Ranging, Active and P L acebo Controlled, M ulti-Center Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Duration of Effect O f RT002, a Botuli N um T oxin Type A for Injection, injectable to treat glabellar lines. The primary endpoints for the study are the investigator's assessment of glabellar line severity at maximum frown at Week 24 and median duration of effect from the date of treatment back to baseline severity. The BELMONT trial evaluated treatment for glabellar lines in 268 subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at nine investigational sites in Canada. The trial compares the safety, efficacy and duration of three doses of RT002 injectable, the labeled dose of the current market leader BOTOX Cosmetic/VISTABEL&#174; and a placebo control in a randomized 1:1:1:1:1 trial design. In October 2015, we reported topline interim data from the trial that showed RT002 injectable achieved its primary efficacy measurement at four weeks for all doses of RT002 injectable and that such efficacy was highly statistically significant as compared to placebo. In addition, the 40 unit dose of RT002 injectable demonstrated a 23.6-week median duration versus BOTOX&#174; Cosmetic with an 18.8-week median duration. Across all cohorts, RT002 injectable appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated. We plan to conduct an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the first half of 2016. We then expect to begin Phase 3 clinical studies of RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar lines in the second half of 2016. If approved, we believe RT002 injectable has the potential to satisfy significant unmet needs. 

Cervical Dystonia and Other Muscle Movement Disorders 

We have also been developing RT002 for the treatment of cervical dystonia, a muscle movement disorder. We will continue to evaluate development for other therapeutic indications, such as neurological movement and other disorders, based on the results of our current preclinical studies and clinical trials. Muscle movement disorders, such as cervical dystonia, are neurological conditions that affect a person's ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. Muscle spasticity happens after the body's nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke, disease, or trauma. While not life-threatening, spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Some tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become difficult, and a person's self-esteem may be affected by their abnormal posture. Common muscle movement disorders include cervical dystonia (excessive pulling of the muscles in the neck and shoulder), upper or lower limb spasticity (stiffness in muscles), and blepharospasm (involuntary closing of the eyelids). Botulinum toxin type A has proven safe and effective for such uses, as the most common treatment for muscle movement disorders is to relax the muscle by injecting it with botulinum toxin. Spasticity was the first approved indication for BOTOX&#174;. We believe muscle movement disorders accounted for approximately $900 million of therapeutic neurotoxin sales globally in 2014. 

RT002 Injectable for Treatment of Cervical Dystonia 

We have initiated a Phase 2 dose-escalating, open-label clinical study of RT002 injectable for the treatment of cervical dystonia. The Phase 2 study will evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy, and duration of effect of RT002 in subjects with moderate-to-severe isolated cervical dystonia symptoms of the neck. We completed enrollment in the first cohort and expect to release interim results in the first half of 2016. 

DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical Gel (RT001) or RT001 Topical 

RT001 topical is a topical gel formulation of botulinum toxin type A in a proprietary single-use applicator. The botulinum toxin in RT001 topical blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to receptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals and inhibiting the release of specific neurotransmitters. For example, when applied topically around the eye, RT001 topical produces partial interruption of the nerve signaling to the orbicularis oculi muscle, resulting in a localized reduction in muscle activity and improvement in crow&#8217;s feet and may offer improvement in skin texture and luminosity of the skin. When applied topically for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, RT001 topical produces temporary interruption of the nerve signaling to the sweat glands, resulting in local reduction in axillary sweating. 

RT001 topical is applied to the skin and uses our proprietary TransMTS&#174; technology, consisting of a proprietary peptide, to enable delivery of botulinum toxin across the skin, eliminating the need for injections. We plan to supply RT001 topical in a single-use applicator for reconstitution and administration that contains a vial of lyophilized, or freeze-dried, drug product and a vial of diluent for reconstitution. When the contents of these vials are combined, all within the single-use applicator, the diluent reconstitutes the freeze-dried drug product back to its original form to allow administration. In our crow's feet clinical trials, RT001 topical is administered as a gel and spread over the treatment area with a gloved finger, where it remains for 30 minutes. The application process is a simple procedure that requires minimal time to prepare and can be applied by either physician or medical staff. The gel is then removed by a series of gentle cleansing wipes, deactivated and disposed. 

We are developing and plan to commercialize RT001 topical for indications where topical application provides a meaningful advantage over injectable administration. RT001 is designed to have several such advantages, including painless topical administration, no bruising, ease of use and limited dependence on administration technique by physicians and medical staff. We believe these potential advantages may improve the experience of patients undergoing botulinum toxin procedures and make RT001 topical suitable for multiple indications. 

The first indications we are pursuing are in the fields of dermatology and plastic surgery. If approved, we believe RT001 topical can expand the overall botulinum toxin aesthetic market by appealing to new patients who would prefer a needle-free approach to treatment. The aesthetic dermatology market is attractive because we believe that patients in this market tend to be open to trying new products and paying for aesthetic procedures out of pocket, reducing our reliance on reimbursement. We are focused on this market not only because of its size and growth potential but also because, in the United States and Europe, this market can be accessed by a specialty sales force and distributor network. We are also developing RT001 topical for therapeutic applications where botulinum toxin has shown efficacy and that are particularly well suited for needle-free treatments. 

Lateral Canthal Lines, or Crow&#8217;s Feet 

Crow&#8217;s feet are skin wrinkles in the outer corner of the eye area, which are commonly caused by aging. Consumers in general, and women in particular, believe that the eye area is the first place where they notice the signs of aging. Consumers also believe that the perception of aging is affected by the quality of the skin. A large segment of the anti-aging topical cosmeceutical market is targeted towards improvement in skin texture and luminosity of the skin in the eye area. Despite the fact that prior to September 2013 there were no botulinum toxin products approved for crow&#8217;s feet, we believe that there has been significant use of botulinum toxin for this indication given the desire of consumers to address the condition. 

We believe that RT001 topical may provide the following benefits to patients and physicians for treatment of crow&#8217;s feet, as compared to traditional botulinum toxin treatments that are administered by injection: 

&#8226; 

The RT001 topical procedure is painless and has not shown any evidence of bruising, swelling or any of the other adverse events associated with injections . The RT001 topical procedure consists of a clear gel applied to the skin, remaining on the skin for 30 minutes and then removed with a series of gentle cleansing wipes. 

&#8226; 

RT001 topical relaxes the crow&#8217;s feet wrinkles appearance at &#8220;rest,&#8221; when the face is in a neutral expression, while still allowing a natural smile . Data from our Phase 2b clinical trials indicate that RT001 topical improves the appearance of crow&#8217;s feet at rest. This improvement is visible to both the consumer and the physician. By targeting only the muscles necessary to achieve this effect, treatment with RT001 topical allows for natural expression at smile. In comparison, injection involves a broader array of muscles, which can lead to an unwanted frozen face appearance even at smile. 

&#8226; 

Consumers distinguish between products that are injected into the body and those that are placed on the skin . Of the participants surveyed in consumer market research performed by a third party on our behalf in 2012, a majority of those who responded that they have not received injectable botulinum toxin treatments in the past but who did find the RT001 topical product concept appealing, listed their aversion to needles as the reason why they have not previously tried the injectable botulinum toxin treatments. The responses in this survey, including open-ended questions, suggest that 63% of consumers in the group surveyed are more likely to use RT001 topical over injectable options. 

We believe that RT001 topical may provide the following benefits to physicians: 

&#8226; 

RT001 topical has been shown to be well-tolerated with no significant safety concerns . There has been no report of the spread of botulinum toxin away from treatment site. 

&#8226; 

RT001 topical is simple to use and results are not technique dependent. RT001 topical comes in a pre-filled applicator that contains the proper dose for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet . A physician or medical staff applies droplets of the gel from our pre-filled applicator to the treatment area and uses a gloved finger to ensure that the entire area is covered. In contrast, a great deal of physician skill is required to accurately and precisely inject current needle-based botulinum toxin products into smaller, more superficial muscles to achieve a natural looking appearance in the crow's feet area. According to our market research data collected by a third-party research organization in 2009 through internet-based surveys and interviews: 82% of the 204 physicians surveyed with existing cosmetic revenues said that they were either &#8220;extremely interested&#8221; or &#8220;very interested&#8221; in purchasing the RT001 topical product concept for use in their patients; and 76% of the 204 physicians surveyed mentioned the benefits of topical administration, including no need for needles and easy and convenient administration, as why they liked the RT001 topical product concept. 

&#8226; 

RT001 topical is very appealing to both key physicians and practice groups who perform the majority of cosmetic procedures in the United States and physicians who have less injectable botulinum toxin experience . We believe that RT001 topical can expand the use of botulinum toxin to a wider range of physicians and allow those physicians who currently perform botulinum toxin procedures to do so on a larger number of patients. RT001 topical can also improve the profitability of practices by increasing the number of procedures a given patient receives per visit. Importantly, this expansion can come without any increase in the number of patients that the physician has in their practice. In addition, because the RT001 topical procedure for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet would be paid for directly by patients, consistent with current aesthetic treatments, physicians would not be encumbered by managed care and government payor reimbursement restrictions applicable in the United States and similar reimbursement-related constraints outside the United States. 

Development of RT001 Topical for Treatment of Crow&#8217;s Feet 

We have conducted seventeen clinical trials, with a total of over 1,600 subjects, for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet. In two of our Phase 2 clinical trials, RT001 topical demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in crow&#8217;s feet visible to both physicians and patients. After completing our Phase 2b clinical trials, we modified the formulation of the RT001 topical diluent by adding two ingredients to improve its stability. We then conducted a Phase 3 clinical trial with this new diluent formulation to evaluate efficacy and safety of RT001 topical. Data generated from this clinical trial were inconsistent with the data from our previous three Phase 2b clinical trials for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet. Specifically, we observed no improvement from baseline in either the placebo or RT001 topical group. We initiated two open-label studies to further assess our RT001 topical drug product candidate. Following analysis of the data available from these open-label studies, taken together with our analysis of prior studies and early data from newly developed clinical methods, we decided to proceed with a RT001 topical U.S. Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of crow's feet. Our clinical and other studies have consistently indicated that RT001 topical appears to be well-tolerated with no serious adverse events related to the study drug or study treatment procedures or other safety concerns. 

Phase 3 Clinical Trials. We are in a Phase 3 development program of RT001 topical in North America for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet. During the third quarter of 2015, we initiated REALISE 1, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single, bilateral administration of RT001 topical compared to placebo in approximately 450 subjects with moderate to severe crow's feet. We expect to report efficacy data from this study in the first half of 2016, and if successful, will need to conduct additional Phase 3 studies in order to submit our Biologics License Application, BLA, to the FDA. 

REALISE 1 and a second U.S. Phase 3 pivotal trial will utilize the same basic study design and evaluate efficacy and safety of RT001 topical after single administration compared to placebo. Our second U.S. Phase 3 pivotal trial will also measure duration of effect. We plan to conduct a third Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial in the European Union to support European Union marketing applications. The European trial will evaluate efficacy and safety of RT001 topical after single administration compared to placebo with a follow-up for safety. 

We have designed the long-term clinical trials to support a safety database adequate for both domestic and international marketing applications, and will continue to conduct clinical trials with periodic, thorough analyses of benefits and risks. 

Assuming successful completion of our Phase 3 clinical trials, we plan to file marketing applications in the United States, European Union and Canada. We anticipate that approval in the United States and the European Union would then support approvals in Latin America, such as Brazil and certain other territories in Asia. 

European Union Agency Interactions. We requested scientific guidance from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on the development of RT001 topical for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet and the proposed Phase 3 program in March 2012. The EMA scientific guidance for the crow&#8217;s feet Phase 3 program was completed following a meeting with the EMA in August 2012. The EMA provided comments on Quality, Nonclinical and Clinical programs. Overall, the EMA agreed with the proposed programs and provided details and suggestions to be considered for our marketing application. We have taken the EMA comments into consideration in the Phase 3 program and will provide data to support the various requests in the marketing application. 

End-of-Phase 2. After our Phase 2 clinical trials, we used the FDA&#8217;s Formal Dispute Resolution process and obtained written confirmation in May 2012 from the FDA that we had achieved End-of-Phase 2 and that our proposed indication, primary endpoint assessment and primary endpoint measurement were acceptable for Phase 3 clinical trials. Specifically, the primary efficacy assessments are being conducted at rest and additional assessments are being obtained at smile. 

RT001 Topical Safety 

Clinical Program. Subjects have received doses of RT001 topical containing 1.1 to 25 ng/mL of botulinum toxin per subject and peptide exposures up to 23 mcg/mL per subject for the treatment of crow's feet. Repeat doses of RT001 topical have been administered in the Phase 2 trials and the Phase 1 trial with cumulative exposures up to 50 ng/mL per subject. In all concentrations of peptide and botulinum toxin studied, RT001 topical appeared to be well-tolerated with no serious adverse events related to study drug or study treatment procedures or safety concerns. In particular, there were no systemic or local safety concerns at the site of application or evidence of spread and no significant differences in the incidence of treatment-related adverse events. 

Nonclinical Program. In accordance with international guidelines and in consultation with the FDA, we have also conducted a broad nonclinical development program for RT001 topical. The program included preclinical efficacy, safety 

bioavailability and single and repeat dose toxicity studies of RT001 topical, including chronic studies of up to nine months duration. Genotoxicity, local tolerance and formulation bridging studies were also conducted, along with reproductive toxicity testing. Together, these studies supported the clinical development and anticipated future safety labeling of RT001 topical for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet. 

Hyperhidrosis 

We are also developing RT001 topical for therapeutic applications where botulinum toxin is particularly well suited for needle-free treatments. According to published medical articles, hyperhidrosis affects approximately nine million people in the United States (or 2.8% of the current population), with approximately half experiencing axillary hyperhidrosis, or underarm excessive sweating. Prevalence in the United States is slightly higher among men than women, but women are more likely to take action to have the condition treated. In 2014, the International Hyperhidrosis Society or IHHS fielded a survey among its email subscribers. While it is recognized that consumers who regularly read newsletters from the IHHS are likely to be more severe sufferers and those who are more likely to treat their disease, this survey does provide up to date information on this population. Additionally, we believe that these consumers may likely be early adopters of new treatments. In this population, hyperhidrosis is a multi-focal disease where the majority of people (81%) suffer in more than one focal area in addition to their underarms, most commonly the hands and feet. Among this group of consumers, 90% have sought assistance from a medical professional (compared to 38% cited in medical literature that describes the general population of hyperhidrosis sufferers). Of the 90% who seek medical assistance, 79% receive a diagnosis of hyperhidrosis, and of those, 87% seek some type of treatment. The most commonly used treatments and percentage of respondents that use each are: 

&#8226; 

Over-the-counter antiperspirants (78%) 

&#8226; 

Prescription antiperspirants (77%) 

&#8226; 

Oral medication (53%) 

&#8226; 

Botulinum Toxin Injections (41%) 

&#8226; 

Iontophoresis, or the use of electrical current on skin (38%) 

&#8226; 

Surgery (13%) 

&#8226; 

Other (10%) 

Most of these treatments have low levels of satisfaction. Specifically, OTC antiperspirants, prescription antiperspirants and oral medications have satisfaction rates of 5%, 11% and 26% respectively. Only botulinum toxin injections have a higher satisfaction rate versus dissatisfaction (53% versus 35%). Allergan&#8217;s Botox&#174; was approved in 2004 for axillary hyperhidrosis and remains the only botulinum toxin approved for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. However, the treatment requires up to 30 injections in the underarms. Additionally, in qualitative research consumers who have tried botulinum toxin say that often the injections will &#8220;stop working&#8221; or cause compensatory sweating in other focal areas. 

Severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis affects approximately 1.5 million individuals in the United States and similar proportions globally. This condition has a negative impact on the overall quality of life of patients due to the debilitating psychosocial and emotional consequences of excessive sweating as well as significant medical dermatologic impact. Despite this dramatic impact on quality of life there is a large unmet need for effective treatment given the low levels of treatment satisfaction. In fact, even among the most involved consumers survey by the IHHS almost 40% of them either don&#8217;t treat or had stopped treating their disease and were coping with lifestyle adjustments (e.g. clothing choices, limited physical activity and avoiding social contact). 

Injected delivery of botulinum toxin has been validated as a therapeutically effective pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of hyperhidrosis. However, the injected treatment has not been widely embraced by hyperhidrosis patients because of significant pain and trauma associated with the large number of required injections. 

Having a topical solution could encourage more patients to seek treatment without having to suffer the pain of numerous injections. Additionally, a topical solution may more readily lend itself to treatment of other focal areas such as the palms or feet. From the physicians&#8217; standpoint, injections are very time-consuming and reimbursement for the procedure is low. RT001 topical could significantly decrease the physician time and effort necessary for the procedure and potentially make the procedure more profitable for a physician&#8217;s practice. 

We also believe that the appeal of RT001 topical may go beyond the sufferers of hyperhidrosis and appeal to the one-third of all U.S. adults who simply believe they have too much underarm sweat. According to a 2008 survey by the International Hyperhidrosis Society, 60% of all U.S. adults reported that they would be &#8220;embarrassed&#8221; or &#8220;very embarrassed&#8221; by visible underarm sweat stains, and 70% of those U.S. adults who believe they have too much underarm sweat took steps to hide their condition. 

Development of RT001 Topical for Treatment of Hyperhidrosis 

Data from our initial Phase 2 dose escalation hyperhidrosis clinical trial suggest the feasibility of treating primary axillary hyperhidrosis with RT001 topical. As the dose of RT001 topical increased, patients showed reduced sweating and improvement in their self-assessed sweating severity. To test for sweat production, the skin was first treated with iodine solution that is allowed to dry, and then followed by dusting of corn starch and sweat assessment period of ten minutes. The occurrence of sweat causes the starch and iodine to dissolve permitting their reaction to form the dark staining pattern observed. Reduction in the dark staining intensity signals a reduction in sweat. 

This initial Phase 2 clinical trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multi-center study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of using RT001 topical to treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adults. This clinical trial was designed to enroll 36 subjects, with twelve subjects in each dosing group, or cohort. The safety of each cohort was evaluated by an independent data safety committee prior to escalating the dose to the next level. Subjects were randomized to receive a single treatment of RT001 topical or placebo in each cohort. After receiving the treatment, the patients were followed for 28 days in the clinical trial. 

In September 2015, we initiated an additional randomized, double-blinded, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single, bilateral application of RT001 topical for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. This trial evaluated the efficacy of two different doses of RT001 as compared to placebo. In December 2015, we reported positive interim results and, although the trial sample size was not chosen to meet statistical significance, using quantitative gravimetric measurements, the data was positive and showed that a single treatment of RT001 topical gel achieved clinically meaningful efficacy at Week 4. On the primary quantitative assessment of average reduction from baseline in gravimetrically-measured sweat production at Week 4, the results ranged from 214.2 mg to 165.7 mg (p=0.003 for the higher dose) per five minutes for RT001, compared to 66.3 mg per five minutes in patients who received placebo. These ranges corresponded to 81.1% to 79.6% change for RT001, compared to 54.6% for placebo. On the primary qualitative efficacy assessment of a 2-point or greater response from baseline using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale, or HDSS, at Weeks 1 and 2 the results ranged from a 23.8% to 13.3 % improvement for RT001 compared to 11.8% at Week 1 and 17.6% at Week 2 for placebo. By Week 4, there was a 14.3% to 13.3% improvement for RT001, compared to a 29.4% improvement in patients who received placebo. The clinical study indicated that RT001 topical appeared to be well-tolerated with no serious adverse events related to the study drug or study treatment procedures or other safety concerns. Adverse events were generally mild, localized and transient. The most common treatment-related events reported were application site erythema (redness), folliculitis (razor bumps) and application site pain. We plan to advance RT001 topical into a larger Phase 2 study for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in 2016, which will be designed to confirm a final dose. Upon successful completion of this study, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss moving forward into Phase 3 studies. 

Migraine Headache 

Migraine headache is a central nervous system disorder characterized by moderate-to-severe headache and often includes additional symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The global market for treatment of migraine headache was estimated to be $3.8 billion in 2009. Migraine headache affects 36 million people in the United States, 14 million of whom suffer from chronic migraine headache. In the United States, this debilitating condition results in 113 million lost workdays and costs employers $13.0 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Injected delivery of botulinum toxin has been validated as a therapeutically effective pharmaceutical agent for the preventive treatment of migraine headache. Botox&#174; was approved for the treatment of chronic migraine headache in 2010. However, the treatment requires up to 31 injections in a patient&#8217;s head and neck and may have significant side effects, including the potential for injected botulinum toxin to diffuse to neighboring sites causing muscle weakness and pain, sometimes even triggering migraine headache attacks. 

Development of RT001 Topical for Prevention of Migraine Headache 

We have generated preliminary data that support the feasibility of treating chronic migraine headache with topical application of RT001 topical. In our initial Phase 2 clinical trial, RT001 topical was shown to be effective for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine headache. In this trial, RT001 topical was applied topically to five areas on the head, left on for 30 minutes and removed by a series of cleansing wipes. This trial, which used a 25 ng/mL dose, demonstrated statistically 

significant improvement (43.8% for RT001 topical versus 10.5% for placebo) of the composite endpoint of a Headache Impact Test-6, or HIT-6, score, number of migraines and migraine intensity. 

RT001 Topical for Treatment of Other Indications 

Based on the results of our future preclinical studies and clinical trials, we will determine further development of other indications for RT001 topical, such as: 

Neuropsychiatric disorders : 

Chronic daily headache , which is defined as an idiopathic headache occurring on more than 15 days per month for at least 3 months and a daily duration of at least 4 hours, is considered as a headache disorder that may benefit from treatment with botulinum toxin A. It is likely that those patients with chronic daily headache (with or without medication overuse) who are severely impaired (i.e., highest loss of productivity) and who are not receiving any other prophylactic treatment are the appropriate group of patients with a benefit from botulinum toxin. Since this total patient group shows a prevalence of up to 4% in population based epidemiological studies, it is warranted to further elucidate the clinical efficacy of botulinum toxin in this subgroup. 

Major depressive disorder &#32;is a common and serious disease that may be resistant to routine pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatment approaches. Preliminary studies have shown a single treatment of botulinum toxin in the forehead region can improve symptoms of depression in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, as defined by DSM-IV criteria. Positive effects on mood have been observed in subjects who underwent treatment of glabellar lines with botulinum toxin and, in an open case series, depression remitted or improved after such treatment. 

Neuropathic pain &#32;is a condition that may arise as a result of a lesion or disease affecting the nervous system and, as a collection of syndromes, is often chronic in nature causing significant negative impact to quality of life. Existing treatments include antidepressants, serotonin inhibitors and calcium channel agonists, each of which require daily dosing and are often accompanied by side effects and modest efficacy. More recently, injected botulinum toxin has been shown to address many forms of neuropathic pain and provide extended relief, of approximately three months, in line with the known duration profile for botulinum toxin treatment of other targets. RT001 topical represents an appealing alternative with its topical delivery, allowing relatively large areas to be treated without injection pain while maintaining the potential benefit of extended duration from a single treatment of botulinum toxin. RT001 topical is currently in preclinical development for neuropathic pain. 

Chronic inflammatory diseases : 

Psoriasis &#32;is a chronic skin condition that affects an estimated 125 million people worldwide, 2 to 3 percent of the total population, and is the most prevalent autoimmune disease according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium. Animal-model studies have shown the potential role of botulinum toxin in inflammatory skin conditions, specifically demonstrating that botulinum toxin injections improved the clinical appearance of psoriasis. 

Eczema &#32;is another chronic inflammatory skin condition marked by dry, itchy skin. Atopic dermatitis - &#32;the most common form of eczema - &#32;affects millions of people, including an estimated six to 10 percent of children. Early research suggests that there could be a role for botulinum toxin in combating itch by better understanding the interaction of the vascular system in inflammatory skin conditions. While there are available therapies to treat eczema and psoriasis, not all therapies are equally effective. 

In inflammatory conditions such as these, a topical botulinum toxin could potentially provide a viable treatment alternative to the current standard treatment, topical steroids, which have side effects, such as rosacea, perioral dermatitis, and acne. 

Rheumatic conditions : In rheumatology, botulinum toxin may be able to help treat painful blood vessel conditions, such as Raynaud&#8217;s disease and Scleroderma. In initial studies, botulinum toxin injections have shown overall improvement in patient pain as well as a reduction in soft tissue ulceration. 

Our Technology 

Our Proprietary TransMTS&#174; Technology Platform 

Our TransMTS&#174; peptide technology serves different purposes depending on whether it is used in a topical formulation, such as in RT001 topical, or in an injectable formulation, such as in RT002 injectable. In a topical formulation, the TransMTS&#174; peptide technology enables transmembrane delivery of large macromolecules, such as our botulinum toxin type A, to the targeted tissue and eliminates the need for injections or other invasive procedures. In an injectable formulation, the TransMTS&#174; peptide technology may restrict the active macromolecule to the target site and reduce unwanted spread to other neighboring tissues. 

The TransMTS&#174; proprietary peptides are single, straight-chain, peptides which have two distinct types of domains: 

&#8226; 

The peptide backbone core is a sequence of consecutive lysine residues that are positively charged under physiologic conditions. The purpose of this positively charged core is to form a non-covalent (electrostatic) bond with the negatively charged macromolecule to be transported across the skin. 

&#8226; 

The second part of the peptide is a Protein Transduction Domain, or PTD, which is responsible for delivering the macromolecule to the target site. There are two identical PTDs at each end of the peptide. 

We believe our TransMTS&#174; peptide technology could be applied to a range of active ingredient molecules. We have begun to leverage our TransMTS&#174; platform to develop additional products through partnering arrangements and may use our technology platform to develop additional proprietary products. 

Our Proprietary Botulinum Toxin-Peptide Complex 

Our proprietary botulinum toxin-peptide complex has two components that contribute to the performance of RT001 and RT002. First, our TransMTS&#174; peptide provides the delivery across the skin and restricts the toxin molecule to the target site. Second, the botulinum toxin type A provides the mechanism of pharmacologic action and is responsible for the drug effects demonstrated in our clinical trials. 

RT002 Injectable Delivery of Botulinum Toxin 

RT002 injectable utilizes our proprietary botulinum toxin-peptide complex in a saline-based formulation. In RT002 injectable, the peptide interacts with both extracellular structures and cell surface receptors in the targeted muscle. This interaction restricts the toxin molecule to the target site and potentially reduces unwanted spread to other neighboring muscles. We believe that by limiting the spread of RT002 injectable to neighboring muscles, RT002 injectable is likely to be tolerated at higher doses than Botox&#174; Cosmetic. Additionally, at doses where the spread of BOTOX&#174; Cosmetic and RT002 injectable were compared, RT002 injectable appeared to be more targeted with longer duration in our preclinical studies. Nonclinical and clinical data taken together suggest that RT002 injectable may provide longer duration of effect at the target muscle and reduce spread to untargeted muscles. 

RT001 Topical Botulinum Toxin-Peptide Complex 

In RT001 topical, our proprietary peptide carries and releases botulinum toxin to a defined depth of penetration targeting the mid-dermis, which is an appropriate depth of skin penetration for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet, hyperhidrosis, migraine headache, pain syndromes and other conditions. 

Our nonclinical and clinical data show that the absorption enhancer peptide is necessary for the botulinum toxin to cross the skin and have pharmacologic effect. Our data also show that the peptide alone does not have pharmacologic action and that the botulinum toxin molecule without the peptide cannot cross the skin to achieve its effect. 

RT001 topical is applied to the skin as a clear gel. The gel is temperature-triggered so that it is liquid at ambient temperature and forms a gel as it warms upon contact with the skin. RT001 topical quickly reaches a viscosity sufficient to remain in place in the defined treatment area 

RT001 Topical Delivery of Botulinum Toxin 

The absorption enhancer peptide has two pathways for the delivery of the botulinum toxin. The first pathway is energy independent and can occur in non-living cells, such as the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of the skin. This pathway allows the molecule to bind and traverse the stratum corneum where the molecule &#8220;shuttles&#8221; across the surface of the lipid layers in a process called &#8220;lipid rafting.&#8221; 

The second pathway is energy dependent and can only occur across living cells. It is an active process where transcytosis, the process by which molecules are transported across the interior of a cell, takes the molecule from one side of the cell to another. The peptide triggers the cell to fold around the peptide, carrying the target molecule with it. This pathway releases RT001 topical on either side of the cell. When returned to the original side, no net change occurs; but when returned to the opposite side, the contents have crossed the cell. The result is a net flow of RT001 topical from high to low concentration across the cells. 

Administration of RT001 Topical on the Skin 

The proprietary applicator for delivering RT001 topical to multiple locations was developed to provide for simple storage, reconstitution and ease of applying RT001 topical to the skin with minimal training. 

Botulinum toxin is not stable in liquid form. It must be lyophilized, or freeze-dried, for refrigerated storage and distribution. Injectable botulinum toxin products are distributed as lyophilized powders in sealed vials. Before they can be injected into a patient, the products must be reconstituted by a trained healthcare provider by drawing a precisely measured volume of saline solution into a syringe through a needle, and then transferring it into the botulinum toxin vial through the needle. 

We designed our proprietary applicator in collaboration with Duoject, a supplier of medical devices and provider of design and development services, with over 25 years of developing medical devices for drug reconstitution and delivery. The design of our applicator has several features focused on safety and ease-of-use, and is covered by pending patents. 

We plan to supply RT001 topical in a single-use administration applicator containing a vial of our lyophilized drug product and a vial of diluent for reconstitution. The vial of drug product is protected within our device to reduce potential for misuse as an injectable, and to eliminate the potential for needle stick injuries as could occur when reconstituting currently available injectable botulinum toxin products. The pre-filled amounts of drug product and diluent ensure accurate preparation of the intended concentration and dosage for treatment. 

Once reconstituted, our device allows for storage of the dose within our device for up to eight hours, and then provides a means to easily administer the dose of RT001 topical. RT001 topical is spread over the treatment area with a gloved finger, where it remains in place for 30 minutes and is then removed by a series of gentle cleansing wipes, deactivated and disposed. The entire application process is a simple procedure which requires minimal time to prepare and apply by physician or medical staff. 

The Botulinum Toxin Market 

Botulinum toxin is a protein and neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum . Since 1989 botulinum toxin in an injectable dose form has been used to treat a variety of aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the United States. Botulinum toxin has been approved for a variety of therapeutic indications including cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity, blepharospasm, strabismus associated with neurological movement disorders, hyperhidrosis, migraine headache, overactive bladder conditions and, most recently, lower limb spasticity. In the United States, botulinum toxin has been approved to treat two aesthetic indications, glabellar lines and lateral canthal lines, although we believe that botulinum toxin is widely used for other aesthetic indications. Only three products, Allergan&#8217;s Botox &#174; Cosmetic, Ipsen and Galderma&#8217;s Dysport &#174; , and Merz&#8217;s 

Xeomin &#174; , each of which is delivered in an injectable form, have been approved for the treatment of glabellar lines in the United States. 

According to UBS, the global market for botulinum toxin was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2014 and has an estimated compound growth rate of 8.8% from 2015 to 2020, reaching $5.3 billion by the end of this decade. The market is split into aesthetic ($1.4 billion in 2015) and therapeutic indications ($2.0 billion in 2015). We expect continued growth of the botulinum toxin market to be driven by new indications and product launches in new geographies. According to the National Library of Medicine, there are over 200 active clinical trials for a wide range of uses of botulinum toxin, with more than one-fifth of these identified as being in Phase 3 clinical development. While we are unaware of any clinical trials for potentially competitive topical products that may reach the market before RT001 topical, it is possible that clinical trials for such potentially competitive topical products have occurred or are occurring. 

The Opportunity for Botulinum Toxins for Aesthetic Indications 

Today&#8217;s culture places significant value on physical appearance, leading to widespread adoption of anti-aging and aesthetic treatments. The aesthetic market has grown dramatically in the United States, driven by a large population of consumers who are looking to delay signs of aging and improve general appearance. 

Injectable botulinum toxin treatments are the single largest cosmetic procedure in the United States and the rest of the world. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, or ASAPS, a strong consumer preference for non-surgical options and the increasing availability of effective alternatives have prompted adoption of non-surgical aesthetic procedures by a broader patient population. These trends have made non-surgical procedures the primary driver of growth in the aesthetic medicine market, accounting for 83.5% of the total number of procedures performed in 2013, according to the ASAPS annual statistics. Injectable botulinum toxin was the most frequently performed non-surgical procedure in 2013, with 3.8 million procedures in the US, a 16% increase over 2012. 

Injectable botulinum toxin treatments have almost doubled in the past ten years according to ASAPS annual statistics. Global Industry Analysts, Inc., or GIA, further estimates that in 2014, clinicians spent an estimated $1.3 billion globally on injectable botulinum toxin for aesthetic procedures, and such spending is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 10% from 2013 through 2020. 

The Opportunity for Botulinum Toxins for Therapeutic Indications 

While currently approved botulinum toxin products may be better known for their aesthetic applications, according to GIA, the fastest-growing segment of the botulinum toxin market in the United States and Europe is actually for therapeutic indications. This growth has been driven largely by the approval of botulinum toxin products in new indications such as preventive treatment of migraine headache and upper limb spasticity in 2010, urinary incontinence in 2011, overactive bladder in 2013, and lower limb spasticity in 2016. Botulinum toxin&#8217;s ability to affect neuromuscular junctions, muscle activity or the release of neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and neuromediators in a controlled manner has enabled it to be developed and used in a wide range of therapeutic indications. Botulinum toxin products in their injectable form have been approved for multiple therapeutic indications including: 

&#8226; 

hyperhidrosis; 

&#8226; 

chronic migraine headache; 

&#8226; 

urinary incontinence and overactive bladder; 

&#8226; 

movement disorders, such as cervical dystonia and upper and lower limb spasticity; and 

&#8226; 

uncontrolled blinking. 

In addition to these approved therapeutic indications, botulinum toxin products are being evaluated in clinical trials in multiple other therapeutic indications including acne, rosacea, skin and wound healing, scar reduction, hair loss treatments, plantar fasciitis and several muscular-skeletal conditions. 

While botulinum toxin products have been very effective in the treatment of many conditions, there are limitations to the use of the currently approved products in their injectable form. For example, in the case of hyperhidrosis, injectable botulinum toxin products require up to 30 injections in the underarms, an area that is particularly sensitive to pain, and a procedure that is reimbursed to physicians at a low rate relative to the time required to perform the procedure. As a result, the use of Botox &#174; , which is the only injectable botulinum toxin product currently approved for hyperhidrosis, has been limited. In the case of chronic migraine headache, injectable botulinum toxin products require as many as 31 injections in different parts of the head 

and neck. Due to the pain associated with injections and other limitations associated with injectable botulinum toxin products, we believe that there is a significant need for a painless, topically administered and effective botulinum toxin. 

We also believe there is opportunity to improve injectable botulinum toxin use in neurological movement and other disorders. Muscle movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect a person&#8217;s ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. Muscle spasticity happens after the body&#8217;s nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke, disease, or trauma. Muscle spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person&#8217;s quality of life. Some tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become difficult, and a person&#8217;s self-esteem may be affected by their abnormal posture. Common muscle movement disorders include cervical dystonia (excessive pulling of the muscles in the neck and shoulder), and upper or lower limb spasticity (stiffness in arm or leg muscles). Botulinum toxin type A has proven safe and effective for such uses, as the most common treatment for muscle movement disorders is to relax the muscle by injecting it with botulinum toxin. However, such injections must be repeated every 3-4 months and require large doses, typically more than 200 BOTOX&#174; units each treatment. As a result of the discomfort associated with muscle movement disorders and the associated demand for treatment that currently requires up to four visits per year, we believe that there is a significant need for a longer-lasting and more targeted injectable botulinum toxin. 

Our Strategy 

Our objective is to be a leading provider of botulinum toxin products across multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications in both topical and injectable dose forms and to expand the market for botulinum toxin products. To achieve this objective, we plan to develop and commercialize two proprietary, patent-protected product candidates: RT002 injectable, our injectable botulinum toxin, and RT001 topical, our topical botulinum toxin. 

Key elements of our strategy are: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Advance RT002 Injectable Clinical Development. In the first half of 2016, we plan to complete the BELMONT Phase 2 active comparator against the market leader, BOTOX&#174; Cosmetic, for the treatment of glabellar lines and have an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. Following the End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program in the second half of 2016. In muscle movement disorders, we plan to continue our Phase 2 trial for the treatment of cervical dystonia. 

&#8226; 

Complete Development And Seek Regulatory Approval for RT001 Topical . We are in the advanced stages of our development process of RT001 topical for the treatment of crow's feet. We expect to report results from the first of two U.S. Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials in the first half of 2016 and plan to initiate additional Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials in the United States and Europe subsequently. We expect to file for regulatory approvals for the treatment of crow's feet in the United States and Europe. We chose to focus on these markets not only because of their size and growth potential but also because, in the United States and Europe, the market can be easily accessed by a specialty sales force. 

&#8226; 

Advance Future Therapeutic Indication for RT001 Topical . We expect to initiate a second Phase 2 clinical study using RT001 topical for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis in the second half of 2016. In the future, we expect to continue developing RT001 topical for therapeutic indications where injection-based botulinum toxin dose forms are poorly tolerated, or have higher risk of adverse events. We believe that the commercial potential of RT001 topical in therapeutic indications could be substantial given the number of indications that we could pursue and the significant advantages of a painless, topical approach. 

&#8226; 

Build Our Own Sales And Marketing Capabilities To Commercialize RT001 Topical and RT002 Injectable in North America. If RT001 topical is approved &#32; for the treatment of crow's feet or RT002 injectable is approved for the treatment of glabellar lines by the FDA, we intend to build our own sales force and commercial organization to launch in North America. Specifically, we plan to build a specialty sales force to target key physicians who perform the majority of aesthetic procedures, including dermatologists, plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, and oculo-plastic surgeons. 

&#8226; 

Expand The Global Market For Botulinum Toxin Products . We believe RT001 topical can expand the overall botulinum toxin market beyond the current patient base by bringing in new patients who would prefer a needle-free approach to treatment and a more tolerable procedure. RT001 topical's profile may also make it preferable for aesthetic indications where the risk of toxin spreading to adjacent muscles can cause undesired outcomes such as bruising, droopy eye and unwanted frozen face. We believe RT002 injectable also has the ability to expand the botulinum toxin market by appealing to patients who seek a longer lasting effect. 

&#8226; 

Establish Selective Strategic Partnerships To Maximize The Commercial Potential Of Our Product Candidates and TransMTS&#174; Delivery Technology Platform . Outside of North America, we plan to evaluate whether to 

commercialize our product candidates on our own or in collaboration with potential partners and distributors. Specifically, assuming regulatory approval of RT001 topical and RT002 injectable outside of the United States, we will evaluate whether to build in-house commercial capabilities in one or more foreign countries or to seek commercialization partners to maximize the profitability of RT001 topical and RT002 injectable. Additionally, the TransMTS&#174; peptide delivery technology platform can be used for molecules other than botulinum toxin. We plan on opportunistically partnering or licensing the technology to develop this capability. 

&#8226; 

Maximize The Value Of Our Botulinum Toxin Cell Line And Manufacturing Assets . We have developed an integrated manufacturing, analytics, research and development facility that is capable of producing proprietary forms of botulinum toxin combined with TransMTS&#174; peptide for Revance and any future partners. 

Manufacturing and Operations 

We have established capabilities for the production of botulinum toxin type A, including bulk drug substance and both topical and injectable finished drug product. Botulinum toxin is regulated as a Select Agent under authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Detection, or CDC, and as such requires that we perform our operations in compliance with CDC regulations. We are in good standing under our Select Agent license with the CDC. We have assembled a team of experienced individuals in the technical disciplines of chemistry, biology and engineering and have appropriately equipped laboratory space to support ongoing research and development efforts in our botulinum toxin product development platform. We have the ability to manufacture our own botulinum toxin to support our clinical trial programs and eventually, our commercial production. We believe that having direct control over our manufacturing processes will enable us to develop additional pharmaceutical product configurations effectively and with a competitive cost structure. 

We manufacture and perform testing for both bulk drug substance and finished dosage forms of drug product to support our RT001 topical and our RT002 injectable product candidates. The additional components required for our RT001 topical dose form, the peptide, diluent and delivery applicator, are all manufactured by third parties under contract with us. See the section entitled &#8220;Outsourced Components&#8221; below for additional information. 

Drug Substance 

The manufacture of the drug substance for RT001 topical and RT002 injectable is based on microbial fermentation followed by product recovery and purification steps. The process is entirely free of animal and human-derived materials and depends on standard raw materials available commercially. The process is already scaled to support all future commercial demands. Bulk drug substance is stable when stored for extended periods, which allows us to establish reserves of drug substance and allows periodic drug substance production to replenish inventories as needed. 

Drug Product 

Manufacture of topical and injectable dose forms to support RT001 topical and RT002 injectable is currently performed at our pilot fill-finish facility and third-party manufacturer. The manufacturing process consists of bulk compounding, liquid fill and freeze-drying to support acceptable shelf-life duration. We have constructed a larger capacity fill-finish line dedicated to RT001 topical that we plan to validate to support our regulatory license applications and future commercial demand. RT001 topical botulinum toxin and diluent has shown stability to date to support commercial launch. We plan to perform further scale-up of RT002 injectable drug product manufacturing to meet anticipated commercial demand. 

Outsourced Components 

We contract with third parties for the manufacture of the additional components required for RT001 topical dose form, which includes the manufacture of bulk peptide through American Peptide Company, Inc., or American Peptide, diluent through Hospira Worldwide, Inc., or Hospira, and our delivery applicator through Duoject. American Peptide, Hospira, and Duoject have been or were recently acquired by Bachem, Pfizer, Inc., and Novocol Healthcare, Inc., respectively. 

Our agreement with List Biological Laboratories, Inc., or List Laboratories, a developer of botulinum toxin, includes certain milestone payments related to the clinical development of our botulinum toxin products and the toxin manufacturing process. There is a royalty with an effective rate ranging from low-to-mid single-digit percentages of future sales of botulinum toxin. Our agreement with List Laboratories will remain in effect until expiration of our royalty obligations and may be terminated earlier on mutual agreement or because of a material breach by either party. 

Our agreement with Hospira includes product development services and manufacture and supply services and requires that we provide Hospira with advance forecasts of our product needs. This agreement also includes minimum purchase requirements once we have commercialized our products. Our agreement with Hospira will remain in effect for seven years, subject to extensions, after we commercialize our products and may be terminated earlier by either party following advance notice and good faith consultation. 

Our agreement with Duoject includes development work and manufacture and supply services. This agreement also includes a royalty of less than one percent of future sales of products which include the delivery applicator, in the event we do not use Duoject to manufacture the delivery applicator. Our agreement with Duoject will remain in effect until the later of April 30, 2020 or the expiration of the last patent issued to us for the delivery applicator and may be terminated earlier because of a material breach by either party. 

Our agreement with American Peptide includes development, manufacture and supply of peptide in accordance with certain specifications. This agreement also includes certain quality control and inspection provisions through which we can ensure the satisfactory quality of our peptide. Our agreement with American Peptide will remain in effect until May 20, 2020 and may be terminated earlier by either party following advance notice or a material breach by either party. 

Competition 

We expect to enter highly competitive pharmaceutical and medical device markets. Successful competitors in the pharmaceutical and medical device markets have the ability to effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical staff. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing. 

Many of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition to product development, testing, approval and promotion, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries include industry consolidation, product quality and price, product technology, reputation, customer service and access to technical information. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop competing or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases, which could lead to litigation. 

Upon marketing approval, the first expected use of our products will be to treat crow&#8217;s feet, glabellar lines and other indications in aesthetic medicine, followed by potential use to treat excessive sweating, cervical dystonia and other therapeutic conditions. The technologies with which we expect to compete directly are injectable and topical neuromodulators, and to a lesser extent, dermal fillers. 

Injectable and Topical Neuromodulators 

Our primary competitors in the pharmaceutical market are companies offering injectable dose forms of botulinum toxin, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

BOTOX &#174; and BOTOX Cosmetic&#174;, marketed by Allergan, Inc., since its original approval by the FDA in 1989, has been approved for multiple indications, including glabellar lines, crow&#8217;s feet, hyperhidrosis, upper and lower limb spasticity, cervical dystonia, strabismus, blepharospasm, chronic migraine, incontinence, and overactive bladder. In November 2015, Pfizer Inc. and Allergan entered into a merger agreement set to close in 2016. This creates a leading global pharmaceutical company with significant research, discovery, and delivery capabilities. 

&#8226; 

Myobloc &#174; , a neuromodulator currently marketed by US WorldMeds and approved by the FDA in 2000. 

&#8226; 

Dysport &#174; , an injectable botulinum toxin for the treatment of cervical dystonia, and glabellar lines and upper limb spasticity, which is marketed by Ipsen Ltd., or Ipsen, and Galderma, a Nestle company. Galderma acquired rights to market the product in the United States and Canada from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. in 2014. Dysport&#174; was approved by the FDA in 2009. Ipsen had previously received marketing authorization for a cosmetic indication for Dysport &#174; &#32;in Germany in 2006 and, in 2007, Ipsen granted Galderma an exclusive 

development and marketing license for Dysport &#174; &#32;for cosmetic indications in the European Union, Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and first rights of negotiation for other countries around the world, except the United States, Canada and Japan. In 2008, Galderma became Ipsen&#8217;s sole distributor for Dysport &#174; &#32;in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. In 2009, the health authorities of 15 European Union countries approved Dysport &#174; &#32;for glabellar lines under the trade name Azzalure &#174; . In 2011, Ipsen and Syntaxin engaged in a research collaboration agreement to develop native and engineered formats of botulinum toxin. 

&#8226; 

Xeomin &#174; , marketed by Merz Pharma, or Merz, and approved by the FDA in 2010 for cervical dystonia and blepharospasm in adults previously treated with Botox &#174; . In the third quarter of 2011, Xeomin &#174; &#32;was approved by the FDA and in Korea for glabellar lines. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Xeomin &#174; was approved by the FDA for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. Xeomin &#174; &#32;is also currently approved for therapeutic indications in most countries in the European Union as well as Canada and certain countries in Latin America and Asia. Bocouture &#174; &#32;(rebranded from Xeomin &#174; ), marketed by Merz and received approval for glabellar lines in Germany in 2009. In 2010, Bocouture &#174; &#32;was approved in significant markets within the European Union. Xeomin &#174; &#32;is also approved for glabellar lines in Argentina and Mexico. 

We are aware of competing neuromodulators currently being developed and commercialized in Asia, South America and other markets. These lightly regulated markets may not require adherence to the FDA&#8217;s cGMPs or the regulatory requirements of the European Medicines Agency or other regulatory agencies in countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While these products are unlikely to meet stringent U.S. regulatory standards, the companies operating in these markets may be able to produce products at a lower cost than United States and European manufacturers. In addition to the injectable botulinum toxin dose forms, we are aware that other companies are developing topical neuromodulators for cosmetic and therapeutics indications and are conducting clinical trials for acne and facial aesthetic and hyperhidrosis. 

Aesthetic Medicine 

We anticipate that the first use of our products will be in the professional facial aesthetic medicine market, which includes neurotoxins and dermal fillers, as well as polymer-based injectables. These and other products experience indirect competition from procedures, such as laser treatments, face lifts, chemical peels, fat injections and cold therapy. In the United States, dermal filler products, including Allergan&#8217;s Juv&#233;derm family of fillers including Juv&#233;derm VoLUMA &#174; &#32;XC, compete with Galderma&#8217;s products Restylane &#174; &#32;and Perlane&#8482;. In 2010, the FDA approved Allergan&#8217;s Juv&#233;derm &#174; &#32;Ultra XC and Ultra Plus XC products containing lidocaine as well as new formulations of Galderma's Restylane &#174; &#32;and Perlane&#8482;, also containing lidocaine and Restylane &#174; &#32;without lidocaine for lips. Additional competitors in the filler category include Radiesse &#174; , a calcium hydroxylapatite from BioForm, which was acquired by Merz in 2010, Sculptra &#174; &#32;from Galderma, and Belotero Balance &#174; &#32;from Merz. Internationally, competitive products include Q-Med&#8217;s range of Restylane &#174; &#32;and Perlane&#8482; products, as well as products from Anteis, Filoraga, Teoxane, Galderma and a large number of other hyaluronic acid, bioceramic, protein and other polymer-based dermal fillers. 

Sales and Marketing 

We currently have limited marketing capabilities and no sales organization. Assuming successful completion of clinical trials and receipt of marketing approval for RT001 topical for treatment of crow&#8217;s feet or for RT002 injectable for treatment of glabellar lines by the FDA, we plan to launch in North America with our own sales force and commercial organization. Specifically, we would access the North American market through a focused, specialized sales force that targets the core physicians (dermatologists, plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and oculo-plastic surgeons) who perform the majority of the cosmetic procedures. Assuming approval to market in the United States, we will focus our initial marketing of RT001 topical and RT002 injectable on these core specialties. 

After European approval to market, we anticipate marketing RT001 topical and RT002 injectable through either our own commercial infrastructure or a combination of our own infrastructure and that of our possible future partners. For future uses of RT001 topical and RT002 injectable outside of aesthetic medicine, we are evaluating launching on our own or through partner relationships. 

Strategic Partnering 

We plan to focus our efforts on developing and commercializing RT001 topical and RT002 injectable in North America. We intend to market on our own and seek collaborative relationships outside of North America to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates and delivery technology. 

We also plan to leverage our TransMTS &#174; &#32;technology platform outside of our core focus in botulinum toxin by partnering with other companies. For example, in June 2013 we entered into an exclusive technology evaluation agreement with the Procter &#38; Gamble Company to co-develop a peptide and explore applications of the TransMTS &#174; &#32;delivery technology in two classes of over-the-counter cosmetic compounds. If successful, this partnership would enable us to receive royalty revenue. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, novel biological discoveries, and drug development technology and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary or intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on know-how, copyright, trademarks and trade secret laws, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Such protection is also maintained using confidential disclosure agreements. Protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers proprietary services and products unavailable from our competitors, and to exclude our competitors from practicing technology that we have developed. If competitors in our industry have access to the same technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected. 

It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity. For more information, please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

As of February 25, 2016, we held approximately 125 issued patents and approximately 138 pending patent applications, including foreign counterparts of U.S. patents and applications. Eleven of our patents are issued in the United States, with the rest issued in Australia, Canada, China, various countries in Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. In addition, we have pending patent applications in the United States as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore. The earliest that any of our patents will expire is July 20, 2021 for U.S. Patent No. 7,807,780. Because approval for RT001 topical is still pending before the FDA, one of these patents, or a later granted Revance patent, may be eligible for a patent term extension of up to five years, provided the total period of market exclusivity based on the extended patent does not exceed 14 years. For more information, please see &#8220;Business - Government Regulation - U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity.&#8221; 

We will continue to pursue additional patent protection as well as take appropriate measures to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our innovative technologies. 

Our registered and pending U.S. trademarks include REVANCE &#174; , TRANSMTS &#174; , MOTISTE, XOTIKIS and JANTYNG. 

Government Regulation 

Product Approval Process in the United States 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, its implementing regulations, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates, RT001 topical and RT002 injectable, are subject to regulation by the FDA as a biologic. Biologics require the submission of a BLA to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the United States. 

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U. S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial 

suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin; 

&#8226; 

approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current good clinical practices, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of a BLA; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if the FDA deems it as a requirement, of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practice standards, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as compliance with applicable Quality System Regulations, or QSR, for devices; 

&#8226; 

potential audits by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; 

&#8226; 

potential review of the BLA by an external advisory committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and 

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale. 

Preclinical Studies 

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, or for other reasons. 

Clinical Trials 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

&#8226; 

Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population, but larger than in Phase 1, to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 

&#8226; 

Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, such as several hundred to several thousand, at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. These trials typically have at least 2 groups of patients who, in a blinded fashion, receive either the product or a placebo. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA. 

IND sponsors may dispute FDA decisions concerning clinical development. For example, we engaged in the Formal Dispute Resolution process with the FDA for the proposed indication, primary endpoint assessment and primary endpoint measurement of RT001 topical for crow&#8217;s feet. In May 2012, we received a determination that the End-of-Phase 2 had been reached for the indication of lateral canthal lines. 

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication to further assess the biologic&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Phase 4 trials can be initiated by the drug sponsor or as a condition of BLA approval by the FDA. 

Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees. 

Once the FDA receives a BLA, it has 60 days to review the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete and the data are readable, before it accepts the BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has twelve months from submission in which to complete its initial review of a standard BLA and make a decision on the application, and eight months from submission for a priority BLA, and such deadline is referred to as the PDUFA date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either standard or priority BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date. 

After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not 

approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval and limit commercial opportunity. 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA can inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before a BLA can be approved. 

The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The complete response letter describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Any biologic products for which we or our collaborators receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling, known as &#8220;off-label use,&#8221; industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, and although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity. 

We currently manufacture clinical drug supplies using a combination of third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing facility in order to support both of our product candidates and plan to do so on a commercial scale if our product candidates are approved. We contract with third-party manufacturers for certain components necessary to produce RT001 topical in clinical quantities and expect to continue to do so to support commercial scale production if RT001 topical is approved. Our future collaborators may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our biologic product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company&#8217;s BLA. Specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator BLA holder. The BPCIA is complex and subject to interpretation as it is presently being implemented. 

Product Approval Process Outside the United States 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 

Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure includes selecting one &#8220;reference member state,&#8221; or RMS, and submitting to more than one member state at the same time. The RMS National Competent Authority conducts a detailed review and prepares an assessment report, to which concerned member states provide comment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states post-initial approval. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict certain business practices in the biotechnology &#32; industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims statutes. We will be subject to these laws and regulations once we begin to directly commercialize our products. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exemptions or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to 

induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal transparency requirements under ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests. 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities now and in the future could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

Environment, Health and Safety 

We are voluntarily assessing and publicly reporting our greenhouse gas emissions and water usage, and have begun to take action to reduce such emissions and usage. For example we have established employee commuter programs, evaluated the energy efficiency of our buildings and installed low-flow water fixtures. Various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board is in the process of drafting regulations to meet state emissions targets. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. However, because we are not an energy-intensive business, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would likely be material to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. 

We are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Certain misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties. We have implemented proactive programs to reduce and minimize the risk of hazardous materials incidents. 

Research and Development 

Conducting research and development is central to our business model. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $47.5 million, $33.4 million, and $27.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future to initiate and complete clinical trials and other associated programs relating to RT001 topical for the treatment of crow&#8217;s feet and therapeutic indications such as hyperhidrosis, and to initiate and complete additional clinical trials and associated programs related to RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar lines and therapeutic indications in areas such as muscle movement disorders. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 103 full-time employees. Of these employees, 82 employees were engaged in research and development and 21 employees were engaged in finance, marketing, human resources, facilities, information technology, general management, and administrative activities. We plan to continue to expand our research and development activities. To support this growth, we will need to expand managerial, research and development, operations, commercial, finance and other functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
