 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Matson, Inc., a holding company incorporated in January 2012 in the State of Hawaii, and its subsidiaries (&#147;Matson&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;), is a leading provider of ocean transportation and logistics services. The Company consists of two segments, Ocean Transportation and Logistics. For financial information by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2015, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II below. 

&#160; 

Ocean Transportation: &#160; Matson&#146;s Ocean Transportation business is conducted through Matson Navigation Company, Inc. (&#147;MatNav&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Matson, Inc. Founded in 1882, MatNav is an asset-based business that provides a vital lifeline of ocean freight transportation services to the domestic economies of Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam, and to other island economies in Micronesia and in the South Pacific. MatNav also operates a premium, expedited service from China to Long Beach, California. In addition, subsidiaries of MatNav provide container stevedoring, container equipment maintenance and other terminal services for MatNav and other ocean carriers on the Hawaii islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai, and in the Alaska locations of Anchorage, Kodiak, Dutch Harbor and Akutan.

&#160; 

Matson has a 35 percent ownership interest in SSA Terminals, LLC (&#147;SSAT&#148;) through a joint venture between Matson Ventures, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MatNav, and SSA Ventures, Inc. (&#147;SSA&#148;), a subsidiary of Carrix, Inc. SSAT provides terminal and stevedoring services to various carriers at six terminal facilities on the U.S. West Coast, including to MatNav at three of those facilities. Matson records its share of income in the joint venture in operating expenses within the Ocean Transportation segment due to the nature of SSAT&#146;s operations. 

&#160; 

Horizon Acquisition: &#160; On May 29, 2015, Matson completed its acquisition of Horizon Lines, Inc. (&#147;Horizon&#148;). As a result, Matson acquired Horizon&#146;s Alaska operations and assumed all of Horizon&#146;s non-Hawaii assets and liabilities (the &#147;Horizon Acquisition&#148;). For additional information on the Horizon Acquisition, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II below.

&#160; 

Logistics: &#160; Matson&#146;s Logistics business is conducted through Matson Logistics, Inc. (&#147;Matson Logistics&#148; or &#147;Logistics&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MatNav. Established in 1987, Matson Logistics is an asset-light business that provides multimodal transportation services, including domestic and international rail intermodal service (&#147;Intermodal&#148;); long-haul and regional highway brokerage, specialized hauling, flat-bed and project services, less-than-truckload services, and expedited freight services (collectively &#147;Highway&#148;); supply chain management, and warehousing and distribution services.

A. &#160; BUSINESS DESCRIPTION 

&#160; 

(1) Operations 

&#160; 

Ocean Transportation 

&#160; 

Matson&#146;s Services: &#160; Matson&#146;s Ocean Transportation segment provides the following ocean freight services:

&#160; 

Hawaii Service: Matson&#146;s Hawaii service provides ocean freight services (lift-on/lift-off, roll-on/roll-off and conventional services) between the ports of Long Beach, Oakland, Seattle, and the major ports in Hawaii on the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui and Hawaii. Matson is the largest carrier of ocean cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii.

&#160; 

Westbound cargo carried by Matson to Hawaii includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods, building materials, automobiles and household goods. Matson&#146;s eastbound cargo from Hawaii includes automobiles, household goods, dry containers of mixed commodities, and livestock. The majority of Matson&#146;s Hawaii service revenue is derived from the westbound carriage of containerized freight and automobiles. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Alaska Service: Matson&#146;s Alaska service, which Matson acquired on May 29, 2015 as part of the Horizon Acquisition, provides ocean freight services (lift-on/lift-off and conventional services) between the port of Tacoma, Washington, and the ports of Anchorage, Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor in Alaska. The Company also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan, and other transportation services to smaller locations in Alaska.

&#160; 

Matson&#146;s northbound cargo to Alaska includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods, household goods, and automobiles. Matson&#146;s southbound cargo from Alaska primarily consists of household goods, automobiles and seafood. 

&#160; 

China Service: Matson&#146;s China service is part of an integrated Hawaii/Guam/China service. This service carries cargo from Long Beach to Honolulu and then to Guam. The vessels continue to the ports of Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai in China, where they are loaded with cargo to be discharged in Long Beach. These vessels also carry cargo destined to and originating from the Guam and Micronesia services. China cargo consists mainly of garments, footwear, and other retail merchandise.

&#160; 

Guam Service: Matson&#146;s Guam service provides weekly container and conventional freight services carrying mainly general sustenance cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Guam. Additionally, Matson provides freight services from Guam to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

&#160; 

Micronesia Service: Matson&#146;s Micronesia service provides container and conventional freight services carrying mainly general sustenance cargo between the U.S. West Coast and the islands of Kwajalein, Ebeye and Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the islands of Yap, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau. Cargo destined for these locations is transshipped through Guam.

&#160; 

South Pacific Service: Matson&#146;s South Pacific service provides container and conventional freight services carrying general sustenance cargo between New Zealand and other South Pacific Islands including Fiji, Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, Niue, Vanuatu, Nauru, and the Solomon Islands.

&#160; 

Matson&#146;s Vessel Information: Matson&#146;s fleet includes 23 owned and three chartered vessels. The Matson-owned fleet represents an initial investment of approximately $1.4 billion and consists of: 17 containerships; two combination container/roll-on/roll-off ships; one roll-on/roll-off barge; and three container barges equipped with cranes (see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 of Part II below for additional information about vessel costs and net book values). The majority of vessels in the Matson-owned fleet have been acquired with the assistance of withdrawals from a Capital Construction Fund (&#147;CCF&#148;) established under Section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II below for additional information about the CCF).

&#160; 

During the fourth quarter of 2013, MatNav and Philly Shipyard (formerly known as Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, Inc.) entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which Philly Shipyard will construct two new 3,600 twenty-foot equivalent unit (&#147;TEU&#148;) Aloha-class containerships with dual-fuel capable engines, which are expected to be delivered during the third quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 (the &#147;Shipbuilding Agreements&#148;), at a total cost of approximately $418.0 million. Philly Shipyard&#146;s obligations under the Shipbuilding Agreements are guaranteed by Aker Philadelphia Shipyard ASA, a publicly listed company on the OSLO Stock Exchange. 

&#160; 

As a complement to its fleet, as of December 31, 2015, Matson owns approximately 37,400 containers and 12,200 chassis, which represents an initial investment of approximately $295 million, and miscellaneous other equipment. Matson also leases approximately 13,700 containers and 11,100 chassis. 

&#160; 

Matson&#146;s U.S. flagged vessels must meet specified seaworthiness standards established by U.S. Coast Guard rules and classification society requirements. These standards require that our ships undergo two dry-docking inspections within a five-year period. The majority of Matson&#146;s U.S. flagged vessels are enrolled in the U.S. Coast Guard&#146;s Underwater Survey in Lieu of Dry-docking (&#147;UWILD&#148;) program. The UWILD program allows eligible ships to meet their intermediate dry-docking requirement with a less costly underwater inspection. 

&#160; 

Matson operates four non-U.S. flagged vessels (one owned; one under a bareboat charter arrangement; and two on time charter arrangements) in the Micronesia and South Pacific services. Matson is responsible for ensuring that the owned and bareboat chartered vessels meet international standards for seaworthiness, which among other requirements generally mandate that Matson perform two dry-docking inspections every five years. The dry-dockings of Matson&#146;s time chartered vessels are the responsibility of the ships&#146; owners. 

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition, SSAT provides terminal and stevedoring services to various carriers at six terminal facilities on the U.S. West Coast and to MatNav at three of those facilities, including Long Beach and Oakland, California, and Seattle, Washington. Matson records its share of income in the joint venture in operating expenses within the Ocean Transportation segment due to the nature of SSAT&#146;s operations. Furthermore, APM Terminals provides terminal and stevedoring services to MatNav in Tacoma, Washington.

&#160; 

(2) &#160; Maritime Laws and the Jones Act 

&#160; 

Maritime Laws: &#160; All interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. falls under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act).

&#160; 

The Jones Act is a long-standing cornerstone of U.S. maritime policy. Under the Jones Act, all vessels transporting cargo between covered U.S. ports must, subject to limited exceptions, be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, be manned predominantly by U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and 75 percent owned by U.S. citizens. U.S. flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign flagged vessels and are subject to rigorous supervision and inspections by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Coast Guard, which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members. Under Section 27 of the Jones Act, the carriage of cargo between the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited. 

&#160; 

During 2015, approximately 67 percent of Matson&#146;s revenues generated by ocean transportation services, including Hawaii and Alaska, came from trades that were subject to the Jones Act. Matson&#146;s Hawaii and Alaska trade routes are included within the non-contiguous Jones Act market. Hawaii, as an island economy, and Alaska due to its geographical location, are both dependent on ocean transportation. The Jones Act ensures frequent, reliable, roundtrip service to these locations. Matson&#146;s vessels operating in these trade routes are fully Jones Act qualified. 

&#160; 

Matson is a member of the American Maritime Partnership (&#147;AMP&#148;), which supports the retention of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. The Jones Act has broad support from both houses of Congress. Matson also believes that the ongoing war on terrorism has further solidified political support for U.S. flagged vessels because a vital and dedicated U.S. merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense, as well as a critical source of trained U.S. mariners for wartime support. AMP seeks to inform elected officials and the public about the economic, national security, commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws. Repeal of the Jones Act would allow foreign-flag vessel operators that do not have to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations to sail between U.S. ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. domestic operators that must comply with all such laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Other U.S. maritime laws require vessels operating between Guam, a U.S. territory, and U.S. ports to be U.S. flagged and predominantly U.S. crewed, but not U.S. built. 

&#160; 

Cabotage laws are not unique to the United States, and similar laws exist around the world in over 50 countries, including regions in which Matson provides ocean transportation services. Any changes in such laws may have an impact on the services provided by Matson in those regions. 

&#160; 

(3) &#160; Competition 

&#160; 

Hawaii Service: &#160; Matson&#146;s Hawaii service has one major containership competitor, Pasha Hawaii (&#147;Pasha&#148;), which operates container and roll-on/roll-off services between the ports of San Diego, Long Beach and Oakland, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii. There also are two barge operators, Aloha Marine Lines and Sause Brothers, which offer barge service between the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.

&#160; 

Foreign-flag vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from non-U.S. locations also provide competition for Matson&#146;s Hawaii service. Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific islands have direct foreign-flag services to Hawaii. Mexico, South America and Europe have indirect foreign-flag services to Hawaii. Other competitors in the Hawaii service include proprietary operators and contract carriers of bulk cargo. Air freight competition for time-sensitive and perishable cargo exists; however, inroads by such competition in terms of cargo volume are limited by the amount of cargo space available in passenger aircrafts and by relatively high 

air freight rates. 

&#160; 

Matson vessels are operated on schedules that provide shippers and consignees regular day-of-the-week sailings from the U.S. West Coast and day-of-the-week arrivals in Hawaii. Matson generally offers an average of three to four westbound sailings per week, though this amount may be adjusted according to seasonal demand and market conditions. Matson provides over 150 westbound sailings per year, which is greater than its domestic liner ocean competitors&#146; combined sailings. One of Matson&#146;s westbound sailings each week continues on to Guam and China, so the number of eastbound sailings from Hawaii to the U.S. Mainland averages two to three per week. This service is attractive to customers because more frequent arrivals permit customers to reduce inventory costs. Matson also competes by offering a more comprehensive service to customers, supported by the scope of its container equipment, a dedicated neighbor islands barge network, its efficiency and experience in handling cargo of all types, and competitive pricing.

&#160; 

Alaska Service: Matson&#146;s Alaska service has one major competitor, Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc., which operates a roll-on/roll off service between Tacoma, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska. There are also two barge operators, Alaska Marine Lines which mainly serves Seattle, Washington to the main ports of Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, and other locations in Alaska, and Samson Tug &#38; Barge which mainly serves Seattle, Washington to many other locations in Alaska. The barge operators have historically shipped lower value bulk commodities and construction materials that can accommodate a longer transit time.

&#160; 

Matson offers customers twice weekly scheduled services from Tacoma, Washington to Anchorage and Kodiak, Alaska and weekly service to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. &#160; The Company also provides a weekly barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan. Matson is the only Jones Act containership operator providing service to Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, which are the primary loading ports for southbound seafood volume.

&#160; 

China Service: &#160; Major competitors to Matson&#146;s China service include large international carriers such as Maersk, Hanjin, MSC, CMA CGM, Evergreen, China COSCO Shipping Corporation, APL, &#147;K&#148; Line, OOCL, Hyundai and NYK Line.

&#160; 

Matson competes by offering fast and reliable freight availability from the ports of Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai in China to Long Beach, California, providing fixed day arrivals and next-day cargo availability. Matson&#146;s service is further differentiated by offering a dedicated Long Beach marine terminal, an off-dock container yard providing fast truck turn times, one-stop intermodal connections, and providing state-of-the-art technology and world-class customer service. Matson has offices in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai, and has contracted with terminal operators in Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai.

&#160; 

Guam Service: &#160; Matson&#146;s Guam service competes with several foreign carriers that call at Guam with less frequent service, along with Waterman Steamship Corporation, a U.S. flagged carrier, which periodically calls at Guam. At the beginning of 2016, American President Lines (APL) launched a U.S. flagged container feeder bi-weekly service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan, via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan.

&#160; 

Micronesia and the South Pacific Services: &#160; Matson&#146;s Micronesia and South Pacific services have competition from a variety of local and international carriers that provide freight services to the area.

&#160; 

Logistics: &#160; Matson Logistics competes with hundreds of local, regional, national and international companies that provide transportation and third-party logistics services. The industry is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition varies by geography and areas of service. Matson Logistics competes most directly with C.H. Robinson Worldwide, the Hub Group, and other freight brokers and intermodal marketing companies, and asset-invested market leaders such as JB Hunt. Competition is differentiated by the depth, scale and scope of customer relationships; vendor relationships and rates; network capacity; and real-time visibility into the movement of customers&#146; goods and other technology solutions. Additionally, while Matson Logistics primarily provides surface transportation brokerage, it also competes to a lesser degree with other forms of transportation for the movement of cargo, including air freight services.

&#160; 

(4) &#160; Customers and Rate Regulations 

&#160; 

Customers: Matson serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo. In 2015, the Company&#146;s 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the Company&#146;s Ocean Transportation revenue, and the Company&#146;s 10 largest Logistics customers accounted for approximately 23 percent of the Company&#146;s Logistics revenue. None of these customers accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company&#146;s revenues in their respective operating segments.

&#160; 

Rate Regulations: &#160; Matson is subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board with respect to its domestic ocean rates. A rate in the non-contiguous domestic trade is presumed reasonable and will not be subject to investigation if the aggregate of increases and decreases is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate in effect one year before the

&#160; 

&#160; 

effective date of the proposed rate, subject to increase or decrease by the percentage change in the U.S. Producer Price Index. Matson generally provides a 30 day notice to customers of any increases in general rates and terminal handling charges, and passes along decreases as soon as possible. 

&#160; 

Matson&#146;s Ocean Transportation services engaged in U.S. foreign commerce are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission (&#147;FMC&#148;). The FMC is an independent regulatory agency that is responsible for the regulation of ocean-borne international transportation of the U.S. Conducting business in foreign shipping markets subjects the Company to certain risks (see Item 1A of Part I below for additional information about such risks). 

&#160; 

(5) &#160; Fuel Costs 

&#160; 

Matson purchases fuel oil, lubricants and gasoline for its operations; and also pays fuel surcharges to drayage providers and rail carriers. The cost of fuel oil is by far Matson&#146;s largest energy-related expense. 

&#160; 

Matson applies a fuel surcharge rate to its Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, China, Micronesia and South Pacific customers. Changes in the fuel surcharge levels are correlated to prevailing market rates for bunker fuel prices along with other fuel related cost factors. In markets excluding China, Matson generally provides a 30-day notice to customers of increases in fuel surcharge rates. In the China market, Matson adjusts the fuel surcharge quarterly. 

&#160; 

(6) &#160; Seasonality 

&#160; 

Matson&#146;s Ocean Transportation services typically experience seasonality in volume, generally following a pattern of increasing volumes starting in the second quarter of each year, culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter, with subsequent decline in demand during the fourth and first quarters. This seasonality trend is amplified in the Alaska service primarily due to winter weather and the timing of southbound seafood trade. As a result, earnings tend to follow a similar pattern, offset by periodic vessel dry-docking and other episodic cost factors, which can lead to earnings variability. &#160; In addition, in the China trade, volume is driven primarily by U.S. consumer demand for goods during key retail selling seasons while freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply and demand variables.

&#160; 

Matson&#146;s Logistics services are not significantly impacted by seasonality factors. 

&#160; 

(7) &#160; Emissions 

&#160; 

Matson is focused on reducing transportation emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide, through improvements in vessel fuel consumption and truck efficiency; and the development of more fuel-efficient transportation solutions. 

&#160; 

The global sulfur emissions cap of 4.5 percent was reduced to 3.5 percent effective January 1, 2012, and is planned to be reduced to as low as 0.5 percent by 2020. With respect to North America, the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) received approval from the International Maritime Organization, in coordination with Environment Canada, to designate all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of U.S. and Canadian coast lines as designated emission control areas (&#147;ECAs&#148;). Most of Matson&#146;s vessels operate a portion of their voyages in ECAs while Matson&#146;s Alaska vessels operate a substantial portion of their voyages in ECAs. The North American ECA went into effect on August 1, 2012, limiting the sulfur emissions to 1.0 percent, with scheduled reductions in future years. Maximum sulfur emissions permitted in designated ECA&#146;s were reduced to 0.1 percent on January 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

In 2014, Matson received a conditional waiver from the EPA ECA regulations for three diesel-powered vessels used in the Hawaii service that permits the continued use of 1.0 percent sulfur content fuel for a limited time, subject to the development of technologies that monitor main engine performance and promote full power operations on fuels with a sulfur content of less than 0.1 percent. 

&#160; 

Effective in 2015, Horizon received a conditional waiver (subsequently transferred to Matson pursuant to the Horizon Acquisition) from the EPA ECA regulations for three diesel-powered vessels used in the Alaska service that permits the use of 2.0 percent sulfur content fuel on these vessels for a limited time, subject to the installation and testing of an exhaust gas cleaning system (known as &#145;scrubbers&#146;) on such vessels. The conditional waiver includes a schedule by which such installation and testing is to be completed, with dates of installation ranging from the second half of 2015 to the end of 2016. The estimated costs for the installation of scrubbers on all three vessels is approximately $27.7 million, of which approximately $10.1 million was incurred as of December 31, 2015 related to the installation on one vessel. The Company expects the installation of the other two vessels to be completed later in 2016. These capital expenditures are related to the Ocean Transportation segment. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

B. &#160; EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,663 employees, of which 650 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with shoreside and offshore unions. These numbers do not include billets on vessels discussed below, or employees of SSAT or non-employees such as agents, temporary workers and contractors. 

&#160; 

Matson and SSAT are members of the Pacific Maritime Association (&#147;PMA&#148;), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (&#147;ILWU&#148;) on the U.S. Pacific Coast. The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor. Matson also has collective bargaining agreements with other shoreside unions that expire at various dates in the future. 

&#160; 

Matson&#146;s active fleet employed seagoing personnel in 325 billets at December 31, 2015. Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore. 

Matson&#146;s seagoing employees are represented by unions for both unlicensed crew members and licensed crew members. Matson has collective bargaining agreements with these unions that expire at various dates in the future. 

&#160; 

While Matson believes that it will be able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements with its various unions as they expire without any significant impact on its operations; no assurance can be given that such agreements will be reached without slow-downs, strikes, lock-out or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson&#146;s operations. 

&#160; 

Matson contributes to a number of multi-employer pension plans. If Matson were to withdraw from or significantly reduce its obligation to contribute to any one of the plans, Matson would review and evaluate data, actuarial assumptions, calculations and other factors used in determining its withdrawal liability, if any. If any third-parties materially disagree with Matson&#146;s determination, Matson would pursue the various means available to it under federal law for the adjustment or removal of its withdrawal liability. Matson has no present intention of withdrawing from, and does not anticipate the termination of any of the multi-employer pension plans that it contributes to except for the ILA-PRSSA pension fund in Puerto Rico (see Notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II below for a discussion of withdrawal liabilities under certain multi-employer pension plans). 

&#160;
