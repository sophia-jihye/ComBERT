 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Nukkleus Inc (formerly Compliance &#38; Risk Management Solutions Inc) (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was formed on July 29, 2013 in the State of Delaware as a for-profit Company and established a fiscal year end of September 30. The Company was organized to engage in the business of providing corporate governance, compliance and risk management business services and technology solutions. On February 25 th , 2015, John Nettlefold closed a transaction in which he purchased a total of 137,795,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company, representing 88% of the shares in the Company from Mountain Laurel Holdings. At the same time, Mr. Christopher Neuert, the former Director resigned his position at that time and the shareholders of the company elected Mr. Nettlefold as Director of the Company. Subsequent to the change in control on February 25th, 2015, the new Director John Nettlefold decided to transition the company from business technology to advertising technology. By late July, management had decided that many of the underlying factors of Mr. Nettlefold&#8217;s business would not be feasible as presented. As such, on July 26 th , 2015, the previous Merger Agreement was rescinded. 

Since this rescission, the Company has been conducting due diligence and reviewing several possibilities within the technology arena.
