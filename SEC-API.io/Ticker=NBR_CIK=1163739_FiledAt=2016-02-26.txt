 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Nabors was formed as a Bermuda exempted company on December 11, 2001. Through predecessors and acquired entities, Nabors has been continuously operating in the drilling sector since the early 1900s. We own and operate the world&#146;s largest land-based drilling rig fleet and are a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the United States and numerous international markets. As a global provider of services for land-based and offshore oil and natural gas wells, our fleet of rigs and drilling-related equipment as of as of December 31, 2015 includes: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 430 actively marketed rigs for land-based drilling operations in the United States, Canada and approximately 20 other countries throughout the world; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 42 actively marketed rigs for offshore drilling operations in the United States and multiple international markets.

&#160; 

We also provide innovative drilling technology and equipment and comprehensive well-site services including engineering, transportation and disposal, construction, maintenance, well logging, directional drilling, rig instrumentation, data collection and other support services in many of the most significant oil and gas markets in the world. In addition, we manufacture and lease or sell top drives and other rig equipment. 

&#160; 

On March 24, 2015, we completed the merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;) of our Completion &#38; Production Services business with C&#38;J Energy Services, Inc. (&#147;C&#38;J Energy&#148;). In the Merger and related transactions, our wholly-owned interest in our Completion &#38; Production Services business was exchanged for cash and an equity interest in the combined entity, C&#38;J Energy Services Ltd. (&#147;CJES&#148;), and is now accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate as of the acquisition date. As a result of the Merger, we report our share of the earnings (losses) of CJES through earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of income (loss). See further discussion in Note 9&#151;Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates in Part II, Item 8.&#151;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Prior to the Merger, our Completion &#38; Production Services business conducted our operations involved in the completion, life-of-well maintenance and plugging and abandonment of wells in the United States and Canada. These services include stimulation, coiled-tubing, cementing, wireline, workover, well-servicing and fluids management. Since the date of the Merger, CJES has not been consolidated in our financial results. As we no longer consolidate the results of operations from our historical Completion &#38; Production Services business, our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are not directly comparable to the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160; 

Our Drilling &#38; Rig Services business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig services, consisting of equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation, optimization software and directional drilling services. Our Drilling &#38; Rig Services business consists of four reportable operating segments: U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services. Through our investment in CJES, we remain engaged in the completion and production services business. CJES provides well construction, well completions, well support and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America. 

&#160; 

Additional information regarding the geographic markets in which we operate and our business segments can be found in Note 21&#151;Segment Information in Part II, Item 8.&#151;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

&#160; 

U.S. Drilling 

&#160; 

We operate one of the largest land-based drilling rig fleets in the United States, consisting of 177 AC rigs and 57 SCR rigs as of December 31, 2015. Our PACE &#174; -X rig is the latest generation AC rig designed specifically for multi-well drilling on a single pad. As of December 31, 2015, we have placed 40 PACE &#174; -X rigs into service, inclusive of 8 during fiscal year 2015. We also operate 17 platform rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We commenced utilization of a new 4600 horsepower deepwater platform rig on a limited basis during 2015, pending full start-up of the project.

&#160; 

Our U.S. drilling operations contributed approximately 33% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with approximately 32% of our consolidated operating revenues during 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Canada Drilling 

&#160; 

We operate 58 land-based drilling rigs in Canada. Our Canada drilling operations contributed approximately 4% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with approximately 5% of our consolidated operating revenues during 2014. 

&#160; 

International Drilling 

&#160; 

We operate 137 land-based drilling rigs in approximately 20 countries as of December 31, 2015. We also operate 19 platforms and 6 jackup rigs in the international offshore drilling markets. Many of our rigs in our international drilling markets were designed to address the challenges inherent in specific drilling applications such as those required in the desert, remote/environmentally sensitive locations and the various shale plays. We continue to upgrade and deploy high-specification desert rigs specifically for gas drilling in the Middle East. During 2015, we deployed 3 high-specification rigs in the Middle East and 6 PACE &#174; -X rigs in Latin America.

&#160; 

In May 2015, we paid $106.0 million in cash to acquire the remaining 49% equity interest in Nabors Arabia Company Limited (&#147;Nabors Arabia&#148;), our joint venture in Saudi Arabia, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. As a result, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of Nabors Arabia on the acquisition date based on their respective fair values. We have also consolidated the operating results of Nabors Arabia since the acquisition date and reported those results in our International drilling segment. The acquisition of the remaining interest allows us to strategically align our future growth in this market by providing additional flexibility to invest capital and pursue future investment opportunities. 

&#160; 

Our International drilling operations contributed approximately 48% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with approximately 24% of our consolidated operating revenues during 2014. 

&#160; 

Rig Services 

&#160; 

Through various subsidiaries, we manufacture and sell top drives, catwalks, wrenches, drawworks and other drilling related equipment which are installed on both onshore and offshore drilling rigs. We offer specialized drilling technologies, such as patented steering systems and rig instrumentation software systems including: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; ROCKIT &#174; directional drilling system, which is used to provide data collection services to oil and gas exploration and service companies, and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; RIGWATCH &#174; software, which is computerized software and equipment that monitors a rig&#146;s real-time performance and daily reporting for drilling operations, making this data available through the internet.

&#160; 

We have engaged in a number of acquisitions with the specific goal of developing projects that enhance our drilling-related service offerings. See &#151; &#147;Acquisitions and Divestitures&#148;. 

&#160; 

Our Rig Services operations contributed approximately 6% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with approximately 6% of our consolidated operating revenues during 2014. 

&#160; 

Drilling Contracts 

&#160; 

Our drilling contracts are typically daywork contracts. A daywork contract generally provides for a basic rate per day when drilling (the dayrate for our providing a rig and crew) and for lower rates when the rig is moving between drilling locations, or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond our control. In addition, daywork contracts may provide for a lump-sum fee for the mobilization and demobilization of the rig, which in most cases approximates our anticipated costs. A daywork contract differs from a footage contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid on the basis of a rate per foot drilled) and a turnkey contract (in which the drilling contractor is paid for drilling a well to a specified depth for a fixed price). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our contracts for land-based and offshore drilling have durations that are single-well, multi-well or term. Term contracts generally have durations ranging from six months to five years. Under term contracts, our rigs are committed to one customer. Offshore workover projects are often contracted on a single-well basis. We generally receive drilling contracts through competitive bidding, although we occasionally enter into contracts by direct negotiation. Most of our single-well contracts are subject to termination by the customer on short notice, while multi-well contracts and term contracts may provide us with early termination compensation in certain circumstances. Such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances the customer may not be obligated, able or willing to make an early termination payment to us. Contract terms and rates differ depending on a variety of factors, including competitive conditions, the geographical area, the geological formation to be drilled, the equipment and services to be supplied, the on-site drilling conditions and the anticipated duration of the work to be performed. In addition, throughout 2015, we experienced downward pricing-pressure and demand for our drilling services from existing customers in light of the industry conditions and, as a result, renegotiated pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers. See Part 1A.&#151;Risk Factors &#151;Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability and Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment. 

&#160;

Our Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers include major, national and independent oil and gas companies. One customer, Saudi Arabian Oil Company, accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015, as a result of our acquisition of the remaining interest in Nabors Arabia and our consolidation of Nabors Arabia&#146;s results of operations. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. 

&#160; 

Our Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 13,500 people operating in approximately 30 countries. Our number of employees fluctuates depending on the current and expected demand for our services. Some rig-based employees in Alaska, Argentina, Mexico and Australia are represented by collective bargaining units. We believe our relationship with our employees is generally good. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to seasonal factors. Specifically, our drilling and workover operations in Canada and Alaska generally experience reduced levels of activity and financial results during the second quarter of each year, due to the annual spring thaw. In addition, our U.S. offshore market can be impacted during summer months by tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Our overall financial results reflect the seasonal variations experienced in these operations, but seasonality does not materially impact the remaining portions of our business. 

&#160; 

Research and Engineering 

&#160; 

Research and engineering continues to be an important part of our overall business. During 2015, we spent approximately $41.3 million on research and engineering activities. The effective use of technology is critical to maintaining 

&#160; 

&#160; 

our competitive position within the drilling industry. We expect to continue developing technology internally and acquiring technology through strategic acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Industry/Competitive Conditions 

&#160; 

To a large degree, our businesses depend on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The level of exploration, development and production activities is to a large extent tied to the prices of oil and natural gas, which can fluctuate significantly and are highly volatile. Since the second half of 2014, the oil and gas industry has experienced a significant decline as a result of decreasing oil and natural gas prices, resulting in a reduction of exploration, development and production activities of our customers. The level of activity in the sector remains suppressed into 2016. A continued decrease or further prolonged decline in the price of oil or natural gas or in the exploration, development and production activities of our customers could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and/or a reduction in dayrates and utilization, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A.&#151;Risk Factors&#151; Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability and Item 7.&#151; Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

&#160; 

The markets in which we provide our services are highly competitive. We provide our drilling and rig services in the United States, Canada and approximately 20 countries throughout the world. We believe that competitive pricing is a significant factor in determining which service provider is awarded a job in these markets and customers are increasingly sensitive to price during periods of market instability. Historically, the number of available rigs and drilling-related equipment has exceeded demand in many of the markets in which we operate, resulting in strong price competition. This is due in part to the fact that most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in the levels of exploration, development and production activities and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas. 

&#160; 

In late 2014, falling oil prices forced a curtailment of drilling-related expenditures by many companies and resulted in an oversupply of rigs in the markets where we operate. During 2015, this continued decline in drilling and related activity impacted our key markets. Although many rigs can be readily moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and many of the total available contracts are currently awarded on a bid basis, competition has increased based on the supply of existing and new rigs across all of our markets. Most available contracts for our services are currently awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. 

&#160; 

In addition to price, other competitive factors in the markets we serve are the overall quality of service and safety record, the technical specification and condition of equipment, the availability of skilled personnel and the ability to offer ancillary services. Our drilling business is subject to certain additional competitive factors. For example, our ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features and, in certain international markets, our experience operating in certain environments and strong customer relationships have been significant factors in the selection of Nabors for the provision of drilling services. We expect that the market for our drilling services will continue to be highly competitive. See Part I, Item 1A.&#151;Risk Factors&#151; We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations . 

&#160; 

Certain competitors are present in more than one of the markets in which we operate, although no one competitor operates in all such markets. We compete with (1) Helmerich &#38; Payne, Inc., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. and several other competitors with national, regional or local rig operations in the United States, (2) Saipem S.p.A, KCA Deutag, and Weatherford International Ltd. and various contractors in our international markets and (3) Precision Drilling, Ensign Energy Services, and others in Canada. 

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our business strategy is to build shareholder value and enhance our competitive position by: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; leveraging our existing global infrastructure and operating reputation to capitalize on growth opportunities;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; achieving superior operational and health, safety and environmental performance;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; continuing to develop our existing portfolio of value-added services to our customers;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; enhancing our technology position and advancing drilling technology both on the rig and downhole; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; achieving returns above our cost of capital.

&#160; 

As a result of the Merger, we are now a pure-play provider of drilling and rig services and are able to streamline our business to sharpen our focus on our core business of drilling and rig services. We continue to leverage the completion and production services business through our equity method investment in CJES and are committed to enhancing shareholder value through this investment. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we made significant progress in expanding our technology portfolio. Our technological development efforts are focused on advanced rig designs with emphasis on automation of the drilling floor, a suite of downhole measurement and sensing tools and the seamless integration of the rig&#146;s operations with downhole sensing. In addition, we are adding complementary services to our traditional rig offering and in many cases replacing third parties. These efforts support our strategy to differentiate our drilling services, and ultimately reduce our customers&#146; unit costs, through advanced drilling technology. 

&#160; 

Additionally, in the Lower 48 market, we commenced the formal rollout of a suite of related services &#151; including BOP testing, drillpipe rental and casing running services &#151; which complement our core drilling activities. These services represent an opportunity to increase our revenue per rig, generally with minimal incremental investment. Moreover, since our rig crews provide the services, our incremental cost is generally lower than the costs incurred by existing third-party service providers. 

&#160; 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

&#160; 

We have grown from a land drilling business centered in the U.S. lower 48 states, Canada and Alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in most of the major oil and gas markets in the world. At the beginning of 1990, our fleet consisted of 44 actively marketed land drilling rigs in Canada, Alaska and in various international markets. Today, our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of 430 land drilling rigs, 36 offshore platform rigs and 6 jackup units. This growth was fueled in part by strategic acquisitions. Although we continue to examine opportunities, including acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions, there can be no assurance that such opportunities will continue to be available, that the pricing will be economical or that we will be successful in completing and realizing the expected benefits of such transactions in the future. 

&#160; 

As noted above, we may sell a subsidiary or group of assets outside of our core markets or business if it is strategically or economically advantageous for us to do so. 

&#160; 

In addition to the Merger, we undertook the following transactions over the last three years. These transactions have allowed us to streamline our business to become a pure-play driller. 

&#160; 

Acquisitions 

&#160; 

In January 2013, we purchased the business of Navigate Energy Services, Inc. (&#147;NES&#148;) for a total cash price of approximately $37.5 million. This acquisition expanded our technology and development capability for drilling and measurement tools and services, and is included in our Rig Services operating segment. 

&#160; 

In October 2013, we purchased KVS Transportation, Inc. and D&#38;D Equipment Investments, LLC, (collectively, &#147;KVS&#148;) for total consideration of $149.0 million. KVS provides various logistics and support services operating in the oilfield and well-servicing industry. Services are provided by tractor trucks, bobtail trucks, winch trucks, other truck types, trailers, container bins, eyewash stations, various types of tanks, shop equipment and other related support equipment. This acquisition expanded our truck fleet, vacuum truck services, tank and related equipment services and was included in our Production Services operating segment for the periods subsequent to the acquisition date until the date of the Merger. 

&#160; 

In October 2014, we purchased the outstanding shares of 2TD Drilling AS (&#147;2TD&#148;), a drilling technology company based out of Norway. 2TD is in the process of developing a rotary steerable system for directional drilling which, once developed, will be included in our Rig Services operating segment. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid an initial amount of $40.3 million for the purchase of the shares. We may also be required to make future payments of up to an additional $40.0 million, contingent on the achievement of various milestone objectives. 

&#160; 

In May 2015, we paid $106.0 million in cash to acquire the remaining 49% equity interest in Nabors Arabia, our joint venture in Saudi Arabia, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. Previously, we held a 51% equity interest with a carrying value 

&#160; 

&#160; 

of $44.7 million, and we had accounted for the joint venture as an equity method investment. The acquisition of the remaining interest allows us to strategically align our future growth in this market by providing additional flexibility to invest capital and pursue future investment opportunities. As a result, we consolidated the assets and liabilities of Nabors Arabia on the acquisition date based on their respective fair values. We have also consolidated the operating results of Nabors Arabia since the acquisition date and reported those results in our International drilling segment. 

&#160; 

Divestitures 

&#160; 

In 2013, we sold the assets of one of our former Canadian subsidiaries that provided logistics services for proceeds of $9.3 million. In addition, we sold Peak Oilfield Service Company (&#147;Peak&#148;), one of our businesses in Alaska, for gross cash proceeds of $135.5 million. We also sold some of our oil and gas assets and received proceeds of approximately $90.0 million. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we sold a large portion of our interest in our oil and gas proved properties located on the North Slope of Alaska. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $35.1 million at closing and expect to receive additional payments of $27.0 million upon certain future dates or the properties achieving certain production targets. We retained both a working interest and an overriding royalty interest in the properties at various interests. The working interest is fully carried up to $600 million of total project costs. 

&#160; 

See Note 4&#151;Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations for additional discussion in Part II, Item 8.&#151;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

&#160; 

Environmental Compliance 

&#160; 

We do not anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change our competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2016. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental rules and regulations and that the cost of such compliance is not material to our business or financial condition. For a more detailed description of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, see Part I, Item 1A.&#151;Risk Factors&#151; Changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. 

&#160;
