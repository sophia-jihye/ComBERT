 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for people with rare debilitating diseases. We currently have three drug candidates in development: 

Firdapse &#174; 

In October 2012, we licensed the North American rights to Firdapse &#174; , a proprietary form of amifampridine phosphate, or chemically known as 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate, from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin). In August 2013, we were granted &#147;breakthrough therapy designation&#148; by the U.S. Food &#38; Drug Administration (FDA) for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of patients with Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, or LEMS, a rare and sometimes fatal autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness, and, in March 2015, we were granted Orphan Drug Designation for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of patients with Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes, or CMS. 

The chemical entity, amifampridine (3,4-diaminopyridine, or 3,4-DAP), has never been approved by the FDA for any indication. Because Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS and CMS has previously been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA, the product is eligible to receive seven years of marketing exclusivity for either or both indications. Further, if we are the first pharmaceutical company to obtain approval for an amifampridine product, of which there can be no assurance, we will be eligible to receive five years of marketing exclusivity with respect to the use of this product for any indication, running concurrently with the seven years of orphan drug marketing exclusivity described above if both exclusivities are granted. 

As part of our 2012 agreement with BioMarin, we took over the sponsorship of an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS. The Phase 3 trial was designed as a double blind, randomized &#147;withdrawal trial&#148; in which all patients were initially treated with Firdapse &#174; during a 91-day run-in period followed by treatment with either Firdapse &#174; or placebo (randomly assigned, about 1:1) during a two-week randomization period. A total of 38 patients completed the three month run-in period and subsequent two week randomization period. In a trial of this design, the clinically significant findings, when present, are worsening of symptoms in the placebo group. 

On September 29, 2014, we reported top-line results from this trial. A summary of the results is as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Primary endpoints: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The primary endpoint of change in quantitative myasthenia gravis score, or QMG, at day 14 reached statistical significance (p=0.0452), with a worsening of 2.2 points observed in the placebo group and a worsening of 0.4 points observed in the treatment group. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The primary endpoint of change in subject global impression, or SGI, at day 14 was highly statistically significant (p=0.0028), with a worsening of 2.6 points observed in the placebo group and a worsening of 0.8 points observed in the treatment group. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Secondary endpoints: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The secondary endpoint for the physician&#146;s clinical global impression of improvement, or CGI-I, reached statistical significance (p=0.0267), with a worsening at day 14 of 1.1 points between the placebo group and the treatment group. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The secondary endpoint of change in walking speed at day 14 showed a worsening of 9.7 feet per minute in the placebo group. The magnitude of the change relative to the variance in this test prevented the change from achieving statistical significance. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patient tolerance of Firdapse &#174; : &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Firdapse &#174; was generally safe and well tolerated. During the 91-day open label run-in period, treatment emergent adverse events occurred more frequently in treatment-na&#239;ve patients than in previously treated patients (approximately 10% of treatment na&#239;ve patients withdrew during this part of the study). During the placebo-controlled portion of the study, side effects occurring more frequently in the Firdapse &#174; group were benign and consisted primarily of perioral and digital paresthesia and infections. No patients withdrew during this period. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; All subjects who were randomized into the trial elected to continue with Firdapse &#174; in the two-year safety follow-up phase of the trial. During 2014, we established an expanded access program (EAP) to make Firdapse &#174; available to any patients diagnosed with LEMS, CMS, or Downbeat Nystagmus in the United States who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with Firdapse &#174; being provided to patients at no cost until sometime after NDA approval, should we receive such approval (of which there can be no assurance). We are informing neuromuscular physicians on the availability of the EAP and working with various rare disease advocacy organizations to inform patients and physicians about the program. 

On July 22, 2015, we announced that we had initiated a rolling submission of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS and CMS, and on December 17, 2015, we announced the completion of this submission. 

On February 17, 2016, we announced that we had received a &#147;refusal to file&#148; letter from the FDA regarding our NDA submission. The &#147;refusal to file&#148; letter states that after a preliminary review, the FDA has found that our application was not sufficiently complete and requests additional supporting information. The letter does not provide comment on the acceptability of the submitted clinical data, and no judgment is made in the letter on the efficacy or safety of Firdapse &#174; . We are currently scheduled to meet with the FDA in early April 2016 to discuss the FDA&#146;s comments on our NDA submission and to hopefully reach an understanding as to what will be required for the NDA to be filed by the FDA for review. 

There can be no assurance as to what additional supporting data (including any additional clinical trials or other information) will be required before the FDA accepts any NDA that we may submit in the future for Firdapse &#174; . There can also be no assurance that even if any future NDA that we may submit is filed by the FDA and undergoes substantive review, that such NDA will be approved and that we will be granted the right to commercialize Firdapse &#174; . 

Our original NDA submission for Firdapse &#174; included data and information (including data from a currently ongoing investigator treatment IND) providing evidence supporting the benefits of Firdapse &#174; for treating certain types of CMS, and requested that CMS be included in our initial label for Firdapse &#174; . To provide additional support for our submission of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of CMS, in October 2015 we initiated a small blinded clinical trial in the pediatric CMS population, ages 2 to 17, to further evaluate the use of Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of CMS. There can be no assurance that this trial will be successful, whether other trials will be required before the FDA considers any NDA for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of CMS, or whether any NDA that we may submit for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of CMS will be filed by the FDA for review and approved. 

&#160;

Firdapse &#174; is also currently being evaluated as a treatment for MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis. In February 2016, we announced the initiation of an investigator-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of Firdapse &#174; as a symptomatic treatment for patients with MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG). The study is planned to include approximately 20 patients and we anticipate the investigator reporting top-line results from the study in early 2017. We are providing study drug and financial support for this trial. If this trial is successful, we will consider submitting an application for orphan drug designation and pursuing approval of Firdapse &#174; for this indication. There can no assurance that this trial will be successful, or, even if this trial is successful, whether other clinical trials will be required before we may seek approval of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of MuSK-MG. 

Finally, we may seek to evaluate Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of other treatment-refractory types of Myasthenia Gravis or other rare, similar neuromuscular diseases, although we have not yet begun to develop clinical programs for these indications. There can be no assurance that Firdapse &#174; will be an effective treatment for other treatment-refractory types of myasthenia gravis or for any other rare, similar neuromuscular diseases. 

We are taking steps to prepare for the commercialization of Firdapse &#174; in the United States. This has included the September 2015 hiring of Paul J. Merrigan as our Chief Commercial Officer. We have also hired several key individuals to begin to build our commercial organization who, together with Mr. Merrigan, are working to develop our commercial plans and operations. With respect to the marketing of Firdapse &#174; , we intend to develop an internal sales force of approximately 15-20 representatives experienced in creating awareness of rare diseases and promoting products that treat rare diseases to promote Firdapse &#174; to the approximately 900 neuromuscular specialists who we believe most often diagnose and treat neuromuscular diseases such as LEMS and CMS. We are also currently working with several rare disease advocacy organizations to help increase awareness of LEMS and CMS and to provide and support education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. We also plan to introduce and support a comprehensive offering of patient services, including patient assistance programs to eligible patients. We further expect to distribute our product through a network of specialty pharmacies with a single dedicated case management hub responsible for interfacing with patients, physicians and payors. 

Further, as part of our commitment to the healthcare professional community, we expect to deploy a medical field organization with several medical science liaisons to support the physicians and their staff who treat patients with the diseases our products are indicated to treat. We also intend to hire several market access account managers who will supplement the efforts of our medical organization to educate payors in an effort to facilitate and gain insurance coverage. 

The following discusses several important aspects of our development program for Firdapse &#174; : 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Amifampridine is a voltage-gated potassium channel blocker. The Firdapse &#174; tablets used in our Phase 3 clinical trial was the same product approved for marketing in Europe and has been shown to be more stable than the free base form of amifampridine. This enhanced stability is expected to provide LEMS and CMS patients with the assurance that their drug consistently has the correct potency and purity and can be stored at room temperature. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We are aware that another pharmaceutical company, Jacobus Pharmaceutical, has conducted a Phase 2 trial with a different formulation of amifampridine as a free base (i.e., 3,4-DAP) for the treatment of LEMS. While there can be no assurance, based on currently available information, we believe that our comprehensive development program for amifampridine phosphate is further along in development than this other company&#146;s development program. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We believe that the LEMS patient community deserves the benefits of having an approved product to treat their disease that has met the FDA&#146;s stringent approval requirements, including a demonstration of safety and efficacy and is widely available for use by physicians treating LEMS patients. To date, no version of amifampridine has been approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of LEMS or CMS. To obtain approval to market a drug in the U.S., a significant number of pre-clinical and clinical safety and efficacy studies must be completed. This includes studies that evaluate the efficacy of the product, including in most cases two adequate and well-controlled, pivotal registration trials that meet the requirements established by the FDA, although a single adequate and well-controlled pivotal registration trial with confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some cases. It also includes studies that evaluate the drug&#146;s long-term toxicity, acute toxicity, reproductive toxicity, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, cardiac safety, renal safety, pharmacokinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Also of importance with an FDA approved product are the instructions to healthcare providers on how to safely use and prescribe the drug to their patients. Our development plan for Firdapse &#174; was designed to meet all of these requirements. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We have already made, and we are continuing to make, a significant investment in developing Firdapse &#174; . Our NDA submission for Firdapse &#174; included more than 60 pre-clinical and clinical studies conducted over the last five years. This is a major investment of capital and years of research and development by us, and is in addition to the substantial investments that were previously put into the development of this product by BioMarin, by the other former licensors of the product, and by the innovator of the product (the pharmaceutical unit (AGEPS) of the Paris Public Hospital Authority). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; While pricing for Firdapse &#174; has not been established, we recognize the importance of access to affordable medicines. We expect to work to develop appropriate plans for broad patient access in the U.S. market to the small population of patients in need with LEMS and CMS. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We expect to have available patient assistance programs and to provide grant support to independent 501(c)(3) foundations to assist eligible patients who cannot afford their medication. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We believe that there are many patients with LEMS and CMS who do not presently have access to treatment with experimental versions of 3,4-DAP. We believe that once there is an FDA approved version of amifampridine available in the market, patients who currently do not have access to investigational versions of this drug because of its limited accessibility through our EAP, through several investigator-sponsored INDs at a small number of academic medical institutions (where the 3,4-DAP provided to patients is supplied by Jacobus Pharmaceuticals), or through compounding pharmacies, will have access to an amifampridine treatment for the first time. We also believe that there are LEMS patients who are currently undiagnosed or who have been misdiagnosed with another neuromuscular disease who, once an approved drug is available, may be re-evaluated and could benefit from treatment with amifampridine. CPP-115 

We are developing CPP-115, a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor that, based on our pre-clinical studies to date, we believe is a more potent form of vigabatrin, and may have fewer side effects (e.g., visual field defects, or VFDs) than those associated with vigabatrin. We are hoping to develop CPP-115 for the treatment of epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and for the treatment of other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and Tourette&#146;s Disorder. CPP-115 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of infantile spasms and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation in the European Union, or E.U., for West Syndrome (a form of infantile spasms). 

&#160;

We recently announced top line results from a Phase 1b double-blind, placebo controlled safety and tolerance study of CPP-115 in six normal, healthy, adult male volunteers. The results showed significant increases in brain levels of the surrogate marker for potential efficacy, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a mechanism known to effectively treat epilepsy, infantile spams, and potentially Tourette&#146;s Disorder. The main adverse effect of prolonged elevated brain GABA, somnolence, was also observed. 

While the primary objective of this study was to obtain safety and tolerability data for CPP-115 administered over 14 days, brain GABA levels were measured as a surrogate marker of potential efficacy, since CPP-115 is a second generation GABA aminotransferase inhibitor. Specifically, this study examined GABA levels in both the POC (Parietal-Occipital Cortex), a grey matter rich region thought to be associated with epilepsy, and which was previously studied using vigabatrin, and the SMA (Supplementary Motor Area), which is thought to be associated with Tourette&#146;s Disorder. The maximum brain GABA increases, in both brain regions, ranged from about 150% to over 200% of baseline levels, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 

We are presently evaluating the full results of this study, including additional data from laboratory safety tests and pharmacokinetic modeling of the patients in this study, and developing a plan to make CPP-115 &#147;ready for Phase 2,&#148; including a Phase 1b dose ranging study evaluating the effects on brain GABA of CPP-115 at lower doses. We hope to commence this next study sometime in 2016, subject to the availability of funding. 

CPP-109 

Tourette&#146;s Disorder 

During June 2015, we announced the top-line results of an academic investigator proof-of-concept study evaluating the use of CPP-109 (our formulation of vigabatrin, another GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) for the treatment of Tourette&#146;s Disorder. The 8-week, four subject open label study was designed as an open label trial to evaluate the potential effect of GABA-aminotransferase inhibition as a mechanism for reducing tics in patients with treatment-refractory Tourette&#146;s Disorder. The most common side-effect was daytime tiredness, and one subject experienced an increase in moodiness and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Vigabatrin was used as a &#147;research surrogate&#148; in this study to demonstrate the utility of GABA-aminotransferase (GABA-AT) blockade, with the expectation that upon successfully demonstrating the utility of this mechanism, further development activities would focus on the potentially safer, more potent GABA-AT inhibitor, CPP-115. 

We believe that the top-line results from this study suggest an encouraging signal of activity in adult treatment-refractory patients with Tourette&#146;s Disorder. Further, we believe that CPP-109&#146;s mechanism of action validates the potential for CPP-115 to be a candidate for the treatment of Tourette&#146;s Disorder. However, there can be no assurance that CPP-115 will be effective for the treatment of refractory patients with Tourette&#146;s Disorder. 

Generic Sabril &#174; 

During September 2015, we announced the initiation of a project to develop a generic version of Sabril &#174; (vigabatrin). Sabril &#174; is marketed by Lundbeck Inc. (&#147;Lundbeck&#148;) in the United States for the treatment of infantile spasms and complex partial seizures. We have substantial previous experience with our version of vigabatrin (CPP-109), which we believe will contribute to our development and submission of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for a generic version of Sabril &#174; . There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts or that any ANDA that we submit for vigabatrin will be accepted for review or approved. 

&#160;

Capital Resources 

Based on our current financial condition and forecasts of available cash, we believe that we have sufficient funds to support our operations through the first quarter of 2017. However, we will require additional funding to support our operations beyond the first quarter of 2017. There can be no assurance that we will obtain additional funding or that we will ever be in a position to commercialize any of our drug candidates. See Item 7. &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; below for further information on our liquidity and cash flow. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to develop and commercialize novel prescription drugs targeting rare (orphan) diseases with an initial focus on neuromuscular and neurological diseases and disorders. Specifically, we intend to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursue approval of Firdapse &#174; for LEMS and CMS . We are continuing our efforts to seek approval to commercialize Firdapse &#174; for LEMS. We are also taking steps that we hope will allow us to include CMS in our initial labeling for our product. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Seek additional orphan drug indications for Firdapse &#174; . We believe that Firdapse &#174; may also be an effective treatment for other neuromuscular orphan indications such as MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG). We are currently supporting an investigator-sponsored clinical trial evaluating the use of Firdapse &#174; to treat MuSK-MG, and, subject to the availability of funding, we plan to pursue the necessary clinical and non-clinical trials and studies to evaluate Firdapse &#174; as a treatment for additional neuromuscular indications. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue required clinical and pre-clinical work on CPP-115 . We recently reported the results of a Phase 1b multi-dose safety and tolerance study of CPP-115, and, subject to the availability of funding, we plan to undertake an additional Phase 1b dose-ranging study of CPP-115 during 2016. We hope to develop CPP-115 for the treatment of epilepsy (initially infantile spasms), Tourette&#146;s Disorder, and the treatment of other selected neurological indications. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue the development of a generic version of Sabril &#174; . Because of our prior experience developing our version of vigabatrin (CPP-109), we believe we are well positioned to develop a generic version of Sabril &#174; . We have obtained the referenced product from Lundbeck and are presently taking the steps required to complete the bioequivalence and other studies that will be required for us to submit an ANDA for this product. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in filing and obtaining approval of an ANDA for this product. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Seek a partner for CPP-115 or generic Sabril &#174; . We may seek a strategic partner to work with us in the development and future commercialization of CPP-115 and/or generic Sabril &#174; . However, no arrangements have been entered into to date. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Seek to acquire additional products . We continue to seek to acquire additional relatively late stage orphan drug opportunities to add to our product portfolio. However, no agreements have been entered into to date to acquire additional products and any such product acquisitions would be subject to the availability of funding. &#160;

Firdapse &#174; 

Product overview 

Firdapse &#174; is Catalyst&#146;s and BioMarin&#146;s (depending on market region) registered trade name for amifampridine phosphate tablets. Amifampridine is the WHO (World Health Organization) registered INN (International Nonproprietary Name) and United States Adopted Name (USAN) for the chemical entity, 3,4-diaminopyridine, often abbreviated as 3,4-DAP. Firdapse &#174; contains the phosphate salt of amifampridine, hence the name &#147;amifampridine phosphate.&#148; We will refer to our drug by its trade name (Firdapse &#174; ), by the INN/USAN (amifampridine phosphate), or both, throughout this Form 10-K. 

In addition to the positive results we reported from our Phase 3 trial described below, clinical efficacy information for the symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS with amifampridine base have been derived from five published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and one published randomized, double-blind, active-control study in patients with LEMS. The data from the randomized controlled studies generally show statistically significant improvements across a number of measures of neurological function, including Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and compound muscle action potential (CMAP), which have been demonstrated to be clinically relevant in patients with LEMS. Results of these studies suggest that amifampridine is more effective for the symptomatic treatment of LEMS compared with placebo or active investigational comparator (pyridostigmine). Additionally, data from multiple published uncontrolled investigations and case reports support the long-term benefits of treatment with amifampridine in patients with LEMS. In some cases, removal of patients from drug can lead to a recurrence of underlying symptoms, but with reintroduction of amifampridine improvement of muscle function is regained. Amifampridine has been recommended as first-line symptomatic treatment for LEMS by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now known as the European Academy of Neurology). In December 2009, amifampridine phosphate received marketing approval from the European Commission for Firdapse &#174; for the symptomatic treatment of patients with LEMS. 

Safety data from clinical data published over the last 30 years in patients with LEMS or other neurological disorders treated with amifampridine show that amifampridine is well tolerated at doses &#163; 80 mg per day. Among the 1,279 patients or healthy subjects assessed in the literature, the most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) were perioral and peripheral paresthesias (unusual sensations like pins and needles), and gastrointestinal disorders (abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and epigastralgia (pain around the upper part of the stomach)). These events were typically mild or moderate in severity, and transient, seldom requiring dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment. 

Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome 

Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, or LEMS, is a rare autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized primarily by muscle weakness of the limbs. The disease is caused by an autoimmune reaction where antibodies are formed against voltage gated calcium channels on nerve endings, which damages the channels. These calcium channels are responsible for the transport of charged calcium atoms that activate the biochemical machinery responsible for releasing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for causing muscles to contract and the failure to release enough of this neurotransmitter results in muscle weakness in LEMS patients. Additionally, LEMS is often associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and in some individuals, LEMS is the first symptom of such malignancy. 

&#160;

LEMS generally affects the extremities, especially the legs. As LEMS most affects the parts of limbs closest to the trunk, difficulties with climbing stairs or rising from a sitting position are commonly noted. Physical exercise and high temperatures tend to worsen the symptoms. Other symptoms often seen include weakness of the muscles of the mouth, throat, and eyes. Individuals affected with LEMS also may have a disruption of the autonomic nervous system, including dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, impaired sweating, and/or hypotension. 

LEMS is managed by treating the symptoms or treating the underlying autoimmune attack on voltage gated calcium channels. Unapproved treatments include steroids, azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system; and pyridostigmine and amifampridine, which enhance neuromuscular transmission. Plasma exchange has also been used in an attempt to remove antibodies from the body. Firdapse &#174; is a symptomatic treatment and does not alter the underlying autoimmune condition. As a voltage gated potassium blocker, Firdapse &#174; prevents charged potassium particles from leaving the nerve cells, which prolongs the period of depolarization. This allows more charged calcium atoms to enter the nerves, which enables the nerves to release acetylcholine and causes muscles to contract and to restore lost muscle strength in LEMS patients. 

Based on currently available information, we estimate that there are approximately 3,000 LEMS patients in the United States. However, until an amifampridine product is finally approved by the FDA and awareness of the disease is increased, it is unlikely that the total number of LEMS patients in the United States can be determined with absolute certainty, as is typical of rare diseases, and the actual number of patients in the United States with LEMS may be higher or lower than our estimate. Some of the factors that affect the size of the population with a rare disease such as LEMS include, without limitation, the number of patients actually diagnosed with the disease, the number of patients who were misdiagnosed with other diseases before it is determined that they have the disease and the number of patients who have the disease whose doctors do not become aware of the availability of a treatment for the disease until after a product is approved or, even if they are aware of the product, are unwilling or unable to prescribe the product until it is approved and generally available in the commercial marketplace. Further, we believe that some patients who have LEMS could have been misdiagnosed with another disease (such as myasthenia gravis) and that while there is an antibody test that positively identifies patients with LEMS, we believe that the test is not particularly well known or utilized at this time by neurologists. Further, we believe that many patients with SCLC, some of whom also have LEMS, are not being treated for LEMS because many of the oncology medical professionals who treat SCLC patients are generally not familiar with how to diagnose and treat LEMS. All of these factors are likely to affect the ultimate number of patients, either up or down, who are indicated and in need of treatment with an amifampridine product. 

Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes 

Congenital myasthenic syndromes, or CMS, is a rare neuromuscular disorder comprising a spectrum of genetic defects and is characterized by fatigable weakness of skeletal muscles with onset at or shortly after birth or early childhood; in rare cases symptoms may not manifest themselves until later in childhood. The severity and course of the genetic disease types are variable, ranging from minor symptoms to progressive disabling weakness; symptoms may be mild, but sudden severe exacerbations of weakness or even sudden episodes of respiratory insufficiency also occur. 

Many patients with CMS may respond to unapproved pharmacologic intervention, including esterase inhibitors, amifampridine (i.e. 3,4-DAP), ephedrine, fluoxetine or quinidine, and albuterol, alone or in combinations. The particular therapy is dictated by the diagnosed CMS type, as drugs beneficial in treating one type of CMS can be detrimental in patients with another type of CMS. 

&#160;

Congenital myasthenic syndrome(s) is rare, estimated at one-tenth that of myasthenia gravis, which in itself is rare. Based on currently available information, we estimate that there are between 1,000 and 1,500 CMS patients in the United States. 

MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis 

MuSK-MG is a rare disease that is estimated to inflict 5-8% of all myasthenia gravis patients (equating to an estimate of approximately 4,500 patients in the United States). MuSK antibodies identify a clinically distinguishable, more severe form of MG. The disease is characterized by a predominance in females, prominent bulbar involvement, more severe clinical condition and resistance to treatment. Although many patients with MuSK-MG are presently treated with anticholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants, such patients do not generally respond adequately to these treatments. 

Strategic collaboration with BioMarin for Firdapse &#174; 

On October 26, 2012, we entered into a strategic collaboration with BioMarin for Firdapse &#174; . The key components of the collaboration included our licensing of the exclusive North American rights to Firdapse &#174; pursuant to a License Agreement, dated October 26, 2012, between us and BioMarin (the BioMarin License Agreement), and BioMarin making a $5.0 million investment in our common stock to advance the development of Firdapse &#174; . We believe that we remain in compliance with the license agreement. 

As part of the license, we took over the Phase 3 clinical trial that BioMarin had previously begun in the United States and Europe evaluating Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS. We completed the Phase 3 treatment phase during September 2014 and announced the top-line results from the trial shortly thereafter. 

Under the BioMarin License Agreement, we have agreed to make the following royalty payments: 

(i) royalty payments to BioMarin for seven years from the first commercial sale equal to: (a) 7% of net sales (as defined in the license agreement) in North America in any calendar year for sales up to $100 million, and (b) 10% of net sales in North America in any calendar year in excess of $100 million; and 

(ii) royalty payments to a third party licensor of the rights sublicensed to us for seven years from the first commercial sale equal to 7% of net sales (as defined in the license agreement between BioMarin and the third party licensor) in North America in any calendar year. 

Under the BioMarin License Agreement, we have also agreed to make certain milestone payments to such third party licensor and to the former stockholders of Huxley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Huxley) that BioMarin is obligated to make. With respect to Firdapse &#174; , the milestones aggregate approximately $2.6 million upon filing by the FDA of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS, and approximately $7.2 million upon the unconditional approval by the FDA of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS. 

Firdapse &#174; was approved by European Medicines Agency for the treatment of LEMS in December 2009, and BioMarin sells the product in the EU. BioMarin is also currently performing or has previously completed certain post-marketing studies of Firdapse &#174; that they are required to conduct to support their continued approval of Firdapse &#174; in the EU. We have agreed to pay one half of the costs of these studies. We have also shared the costs of a cardiac safety study and reproductive toxicity studies that have been completed and are required for approval of Firdapse &#174; by the FDA. 

&#160;

On April 15, 2014, effective as of April 8, 2014, we and BioMarin entered into Amendment No. 1 to the License Agreement, amending in certain respects the BioMarin License Agreement, dated October 26, 2012. The amendment related to purchases of additional product by us from BioMarin, the sharing of data between the parties with respect to clinical trials and studies undertaken by each party, and the payment terms for certain joint studies. 

Breakthrough therapy designation 

Firdapse &#174; for LEMS has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is &#147;intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.&#148; 

A Breakthrough Therapy Designation conveys all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program. The FDA also has an organizational commitment to involve senior management in such guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. 

Orphan drug designation 

Amifampridine phosphate has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA for the treatment of both LEMS and CMS, making the drug eligible to be granted seven-year marketing exclusivity for these indications if we are the first pharmaceutical company to obtain approval of an NDA for a product containing amifampridine as the active moiety for the treatment of either LEMS or CMS. 

The Phase 3 clinical trial 

In June 2011, BioMarin commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States studying Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS, which trial was transferred to us pursuant to the BioMarin License Agreement. The trial was designed as a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation trial in approximately 36 LEMS patients. After patients were treated with amifampridine phosphate for at least 91 days, they were randomly assigned to either continue on amifampridine phosphate or be discontinued to placebo over a 2-week period. They were then returned to open label amifampridine phosphate treatment for a two-year follow-up period. 

On September 29, 2014, we reported top-line results from this trial. A summary of the results is as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Primary endpoints: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The primary endpoint of change in quantitative myasthenia gravis score, or QMG, at day 14 reached statistical significance (p=0.0452), with a worsening of 2.2 points observed in the placebo group and a worsening of 0.4 points observed in the treatment group. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The primary endpoint of change in subject global impression, or SGI, at day 14 was highly statistically significant (p=0.0028), with a worsening of 2.6 points observed in the placebo group and a worsening of 0.8 points observed in the treatment group. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Secondary endpoints: &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The secondary endpoint for the physician&#146;s clinical global impression of improvement, or CGI-I, reached statistical significance (p=0.0267), with a worsening at day 14 of 1.1 points between the placebo group and the treatment group. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The secondary endpoint of change in walking speed at day 14 showed a worsening of 9.7 feet per minute in the placebo group. The magnitude of the change relative to the variance in this test prevented the change from achieving statistical significance. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Patient tolerance of Firdapse &#174; : &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Firdapse &#174; was generally safe and well tolerated. During the 91-day open label run-in period, treatment emergent adverse events occurred more frequently in treatment-na&#239;ve patients than in previously treated patients (approximately 10% of treatment na&#239;ve patients withdrew during this part of the study). During the placebo-controlled portion of the study, side effects occurring more frequently in the Firdapse &#174; group were benign and consisted primarily of perioral and digital paresthesia and infections. No patients withdrew during this period. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; All subjects who were randomized into the trial elected to continue with Firdapse &#174; in the two year safety follow-up phase of the trial. Further details regarding our trial and its design can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01377922). 

The results of the Phase 3 trial were first reported in October 2014 at the 139 th Annual Meeting of the American Neurological Association (ANA). They have subsequently been presented at the 2014 and 2015 annual meeting of the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) and at the 2015 meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). 

Ongoing studies of Firdapse &#174; 

In October 2015 we initiated a small blinded clinical trial in the pediatric CMS population, ages 2 to 17, to further evaluate the use of Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of CMS. There can be no assurance that this trial will be successful. 

In February 2016, we announced the initiation of an investigator-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of Firdapse &#174; as a symptomatic treatment for patients with MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK-MG). The study is planned to include approximately 20 patients and we anticipate the investigator reporting top-line results from the study in early 2017. We are providing study drug and financial support for this trial. 

Pre-NDA meeting with the FDA on Firdapse &#174; 

In January 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss our anticipated submission of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS. Based on our discussions with the FDA at the meeting, and our review of the minutes of the meeting that we received from the FDA, we believed that our clinical program provided acceptable support for submission of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; for LEMS. Further, at the meeting we discussed potential paths forward for approval of certain types of CMS as an additional indication for Firdapse &#174; . 

&#160;

NDA submission and Refusal to File Letter 

On July 22, 2015, we announced that we had initiated a rolling submission of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; for the treatment of LEMS and CMS, and on December 17, 2015, we announced the completion of this submission. 

On February 17, 2016, we announced that we had received a &#147;refusal to file&#148; letter from the FDA regarding our NDA submission. The &#147;refusal to file&#148; letter states that after a preliminary review, the FDA has found that our application was not sufficiently complete and requests additional supporting information. The letter does not provide comment on the acceptability of the submitted clinical data, and no judgment is made in the letter on the efficacy or safety of Firdapse &#174; . We are currently scheduled to meet with the FDA in early April 2016 to discuss the FDA&#146;s comments on our NDA submission and to hopefully reach an understanding as to what will be required for the NDA to be filed by the FDA for review. 

There can be no assurance as to what additional supporting data (including any additional clinical trials or other information) will be required before the FDA accepts any NDA that we may submit in the future for Firdapse &#174; . There can also be no assurance that even if any future NDA that we may submit is filed by the FDA and undergoes substantive review, that such NDA will be approved and that we will be granted the right to commercialize Firdapse &#174; . 

Pre-commercialization efforts 

We are taking steps to prepare for the commercialization of Firdapse &#174; in the United States. This has included the September 2015 hiring of Paul J. Merrigan as our Chief Commercial Officer. We have also hired several key individuals to begin to build our commercial organization who, together with Mr. Merrigan, are working to develop our commercial plans and operations. With respect to the marketing of Firdapse &#174; , we intend to develop an internal sales force of approximately 15-20 representatives experienced in creating awareness of rare diseases and promoting products that treat rare diseases to promote Firdapse &#174; to the approximately 900 neuromuscular specialists who we believe most often diagnose and treat neuromuscular diseases such as LEMS and CMS. We are also currently working with several rare disease advocacy organizations to help increase awareness of LEMS and CMS and to provide and support education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. We also plan to introduce and support a comprehensive offering of patient services, including patient assistance programs to eligible patients. We further expect to distribute our product through a network of specialty pharmacies with a single dedicated case management hub responsible for interfacing with patients, physicians and payors. 

Further, as part of our commitment to the healthcare professional community, we expect to deploy a medical field organization with several medical science liaisons to support the physicians and their staff who treat patients with the diseases our products are indicated to treat. We also intend to hire several market access account managers who will supplement the efforts of our medical organization to educate payors in an effort to facilitate and gain insurance coverage. 

Future pricing of our product 

We have not yet established the pricing for Firdapse &#174; . However, the independent market research that we have conducted to date indicates that we should be able to obtain typical orphan disease pricing for our product and that our product will likely be widely reimbursed by private and public payors for the indicated small populations of LEMS and CMS. There can be no assurance, however, as to the pricing of our product that we may be able to obtain or as to whether payors will agree to cover our product. 

&#160;

The pricing of pharmaceutical products, in general, and specialty drugs, in particular, has been a topic of concern in the U.S. Congress, where hearings on the topic were recently held, and has been a topic of speeches given by several of the candidates currently running for President of the United States. There can be no assurance as to how this scrutiny on pricing of pharmaceutical products will impact future pricing of our products or orphan drugs or pharmaceutical products generally. 

While our proposed pricing for Firdapse &#174; has not been established, we recognize the importance of access to our medicines and, if Firdapse &#174; is approved by the FDA, we expect to work with insurers to gain broad patient access in the U.S. market for the small patient populations of LEMS and CMS. We also expect to introduce and support comprehensive patient assistance programs to assist eligible patients who on their own could not afford their medication. 

There is a vocal group of neuromuscular physicians and some patients with LEMS who have recently raised public concerns in a letter to the editor of a medical journal and in interviews quoted in recent articles published in the press that LEMS patients may not be able to get amifampridine treatment because of the concern that it would be priced too high as an orphan drug if we are the first pharmaceutical company to receive an FDA approval for an amifampridine product, thereby giving us the seven year orphan drug exclusivity and the five year new chemical entity exclusivity for our product. Stories about their concerns have been recently published in several national publications and some in the press have sought to tie their expectations about the anticipated pricing of Firdapse &#174; to stories about perceived abusive price increases of drug products by other pharmaceutical companies. This vocal group has also questioned the appropriateness of the provisions of the Orphan Drug Act that would grant us exclusivity if our product were to be the first amifampridine product approved by the FDA and whether this exclusivity should be eliminated from the law. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate impact of these activities on us or our products. 

Expanded access program 

We currently operate an expanded access program (EAP) that makes Firdapse &#174; available to all patients diagnosed with LEMS, Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS) or Downbeat Nystagmus in the United States who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with Firdapse &#174; being provided to patients at no cost until sometime after FDA approval, should we receive such approval (of which there can be no assurance). We are currently working with various rare disease advocacy organizations to inform physicians and patients as to the availability of our EAP. 

Third-Party Reimbursement 

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private commercial insurance plans and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) plans. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided for Firdapse &#174; are expected to be made on a plan-by-plan, and in some cases, on a patient-by-patient basis. Particularly given the rarity of LEMS and CMS, we anticipate that securing coverage and appropriate reimbursement from third-party payors will require targeted education. To that end, we expect to hire a dedicated team of field-based market access account managers and reimbursement experts focused on ensuring that clinically qualified patients have access to our product. 

Intellectual property protections for Firdapse &#174; 

Under the BioMarin License Agreement, we licensed two pending patents and certain trademarks for Firdapse &#174; . One of the licensed patents is a pending composition of matter patent that, if issued, will protect Firdapse &#174; until February 2027, which includes five years of patent term extension that is expected under the Patent Term Restoration Act. This application was initially rejected following an appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. The application was refiled with new claims. The new claims were the subject of an office action in which the claims were rejected. A response to the rejection was filed and a final rejection was issued. The application was refiled and is awaiting substantive examination. There can be no assurance that this patent will be issued. The second patent claims methods of administering Firdapse &#174; . No examination has occurred on this patent application and none is expected until the end of 2016. We may also pursue other patents in order to seek to protect the exclusivity of the drug, dosage forms and methods of administration. 

&#160;

No drug product containing amifampridine for any indication has been approved by the FDA. Therefore, our version of amifampridine, if we are the first to obtain approval of the product in the U.S., will be eligible for five-year new chemical entity exclusivity, which provides a five-year period of marketing exclusivity for all indications. 

We have licensed the FIRDAPSE &#174; trademark from BioMarin. A trademark application for Firdapse &#174; was allowed, but did not register due to the inability to show use of the mark in interstate shipment. The application was refiled and a Statement of Use was submitted and accepted by the Trademark Office, and the mark was registered in March 2015. 

In January 2014, the FDA provisionally approved Firdapse &#174; as a proprietary name for amifampridine phosphate tablets. This provisional approval by the FDA does not stop the agency from rejecting the name Firdapse &#174; at a later date. 

CPP-115 

Product Overview 

In August 2009, we licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize certain composition of matter patents relating to a new class of novel GABA aminotransferase inhibitors and derivatives of vigabatrin. We intend to develop these compounds for a broad range of neurological illnesses that could benefit from the inhibition of GABA aminotransferase. CPP-115 is our lead compound from this group of composition of matter patents. 

The development efforts of CPP-115 were led by Dr. Richard B. Silverman, the Patrick G. Ryan/Aon Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern University (Northwestern). Dr. Silverman, who holds 69 patents, is the inventor of pregabalin, also known as Lyrica &#174; , which is marketed by Pfizer. His goal in inventing the compound that became CPP-115 was to mimic the mechanism of action of vigabatrin, while making it both more potent and specific. 

CPP-115 works by the same mechanism of action as vigabatrin; that is, the inhibition of GABA aminotransferase, which leads to increased brain GABA levels that reduce epileptogenesis. Due to these similarities, we believe that these two drugs will share a number of biochemical features related to absorption, metabolism, and elimination, and our pre-clinical studies of CPP-115 to date support our expectations. However, based upon our pre-clinical studies of CPP-115 to date, we expect that there will be a significant reduction, and possibly elimination, of visual field defects (VFDs) from the use of CPP-115 compared to vigabatrin. However, there can be no assurance that this will ultimately prove to be the case. 

Further, based on animal testing to date, CPP-115 has been shown to be at least 200 times more potent than vigabatrin in both in-vitro and animal model studies. The increased potency could enable the development of dosage forms potentially administrable by other routes of administration compared with the marketed oral, immediate release formulation of vigabatrin, Sabril &#174; . Further, based on non-clinical testing completed to date, CPP-115 appears to have superior specificity to GABA aminotransferase and we believe, will have a better side effect profile (e.g. less VFDs) compared with Sabril &#174; . 

&#160;

CPP-115 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. for the treatment of infantile spasms. CPP-115 has also been granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation in the EU to treat West Syndrome (a form of infantile spasms). 

Mechanism of action for CPP-115 

We believe that our drug candidate, CPP-115, will be an effective treatment for epilepsy because it increases endogenous GABA levels in the brain through the inhibition of GABA-aminotransferase (GABA-AT). GABA-AT is responsible for the eventual breakdown of GABA and helps to balance its inhibitory effects. 

CPP-115 is a GABA analog that is readily absorbed and promptly available to the nervous system, producing effects that last for many hours after a single dose. Due to the fact that this drug is not &#147;receptor active&#148;, its administration does not appear to affect the baseline levels of dopamine, nor those variations in dopamine levels caused by normal stimuli. 

Epilepsy 

Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. Epilepsy is a disorder with many possible causes. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity - from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development - can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, imbalance of sensitivity to neurotransmitters, or some combination of these factors. We intend to focus our development efforts for CPP-115 on its use as a treatment for West Syndrome (a form of infantile spasms) and adult complex partial seizures. 

An infantile spasm is a specific type of seizure seen in an epilepsy syndrome of infancy and childhood. The onset of infantile spasms is usually in the first year of life, typically between 4-8 months. The seizures primarily consist of a sudden bending forward of the body with stiffening of the arms and legs; some children arch their backs as they extend their arms and legs. Spasms tend to occur upon awakening or after feeding, and often occur in clusters of up to 100 spasms at a time. Infants may have dozens of clusters and several hundred spasms per day. Infantile spasms usually stop by age five, but may be replaced by other seizure types. 

In complex partial seizures, consciousness is altered. Patients may exhibit automatisms (automatic repetitive behavior) such as walking in a circle, sitting and standing, or smacking their lips together. Often accompanying these symptoms are the presence of unusual thoughts, such as the feeling of d&#233;j&#224; vu, uncontrollable laughing, fear, visual hallucinations, and experiencing unusual unpleasant odors. These symptoms are thought to be caused by abnormal discharges in the temporal lobe. 

According to the Epilepsy Foundation, there are about 3.0 million epilepsy patients in the United States, with approximately 150,000 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year. Worldwide, 65 million people are estimated to have epilepsy. The incidence of epilepsy appears to depend somewhat on the age of the individual. The risk of epilepsy from birth through age 20 is approximately 1%. Within this group, incidence is highest during the first year of life and increases somewhat at the onset of puberty. From age 20 to 55 it decreases again, but increases after age 55. 

&#160;

Anti-epileptic drugs work through a variety of mechanisms, including inhibition of sodium ion channels and the enhancement of GABA mechanisms. Although the different types of epilepsy vary greatly, in general, available medications can only control seizures in about two-thirds of patients. CPP-115, like vigabatrin, is a GABA-AT inhibitor, and we are developing it initially for West Syndrome (a form of infantile spasms) and refractory complex partial seizures. Based on the historic use of vigabatrin in treating epilepsy, we believe that CPP-115 may ultimately work best as an adjunct therapy to existing drugs. 

Vigabatrin has been marketed for decades in over 30 countries by Lundbeck and Sanofi-Aventis and their predecessors and licensees under the brand names Sabril &#174; , Sabrilex &#174; and Sabrilan &#174; (hereinafter referred to as &#147;Sabril &#174; &#148;) as an adjunct (add-on) treatment for adult epilepsy and as a primary treatment for the management of infantile spasms. The composition of matter patents for Sabril &#174; in the U.S. expired many years ago. On August 21, 2009, the FDA approved two NDAs for Sabril &#174; for the treatment of infantile spasms and as an adjunctive therapy for adult patients with refractory complex partial seizures who have failed treatments with several other anti-epileptic drugs. The NDAs are for different formulations of Sabril &#174; and both NDAs are held by Lundbeck. Due to the risks of visual field damage associated with vigabatrin, Sabril &#174; was approved under an FDA-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program and is only available through a special restricted distribution program approved by the FDA. 

In chronic use for the treatment of epilepsy, vigabatrin has been generally well tolerated with lower than average neurological side effects compared to other approved epilepsy therapies. The most common side effects reported have been drowsiness and fatigue. However, one clearly established adverse side effect is the development of peripheral visual field defects, or VFDs. VFDs occur in approximately 33% of users when cumulative dosage levels of vigabatrin approach approximately 1,500 grams. These VFDs are manifest as a constriction of the peripheral field of vision (i.e., &#147;tunnel vision&#148;). 

Our clinical and non-clinical studies of CPP-115 

On November 1, 2010, we announced key results for our initial series of safety and efficacy evaluations in a number of animal and in-vitro laboratory studies. These results included superior visual safety of CPP-115, compared to vigabatrin, pharmacokinetic data supporting oral administration of CPP-115, pharmacologic target specificity, metabolic profile, and an absence of genotoxic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and liver enzyme side effects. It was also shown to be effective in multiple animal models for epilepsy and cocaine addiction. 

On May 22, 2012, we reported positive results from a Phase 1a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of CPP-115. The study evaluated single ascending doses ranging from 5 mg to 500 mg (a dose greater than ten times the predicted effective dose of 15-30 mg/day derived from animal data) of CPP-115 solution administered orally to 55 healthy volunteers. CPP-115 was found to be well tolerated with no side effects, rapidly absorbed and eliminated, and exhibited linear, dose dependent pharmacokinetics. 

In December 2015 we announced top line results from a Phase 1b double-blind, placebo controlled safety and tolerance study of CPP-115 in six normal healthy adult male volunteers. The results showed significant increases in brain levels of the surrogate marker for potential efficacy, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a mechanism known to effectively treat epilepsy, infantile spams, and potentially Tourette&#146;s Disorder. The main adverse effect of prolonged elevated brain GABA, somnolence, was also observed. 

&#160;

While the primary objective of this study was to obtain safety and tolerance data for CPP-115 administered over 14 days, brain GABA levels were measured as a surrogate marker of potential efficacy, since CPP-115 is a second generation GABA aminotransferase inhibitor. Specifically, this study examined GABA levels in both the POC (Parietal-Occipital Cortex), a grey matter rich region thought to be associated with epilepsy, and which was previously studied for vigabatrin, and the SMA (Supplementary Motor Area), which is thought to be associated with Tourette&#146;s Disorder. The maximum brain GABA increases, in both brain regions, ranged from about 150% to over 200% of baseline levels, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 

We are presently evaluating the full results of this study, including additional data from laboratory safety tests and pharmacokinetic modeling of the patients in this study, and developing a plan to make CPP-115 &#147;Phase 2 ready,&#148; including a Phase 1 dose ranging study evaluating the efficacy of CPP-115 at lower doses. We hope to commence this next study sometime in 2016, subject to the availability of funding. 

Clinical and pre-clinical studies of CPP-115 undertaken by others 

An animal study reporting positive pre-clinical efficacy in a &#147;rat multiple hit model&#148; in which the use of CPP-115 was evaluated for the treatment of infantile spasms was published in the January 2014 issue of the journal, Epilepsia , The study was authored by Stephen W. Briggs, Tomonori Ono, MD, PhD, Solomon L. Moshe, MD and Aristea S. Galanopoulou, MD, PhD of the Saul R. Korey Department of Neurology, Dominick P. Purpura Department of Neuroscience, Laboratory of Developmental Epilepsy, The Comprehensive Epilepsy Center (CEC) at Montefiore Medical Center / Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York. The study concluded that (i) CPP-115 suppresses spasms in the multiple-hit model of infantile spasm, with onset of effect as early as the day after the first dose; (ii) the therapeutic doses of CPP-115 were well tolerated in developing rat pups; and (iii) CPP-115 showed efficacy for a longer duration at lower doses that were better tolerated than the previously tested therapeutic vigabatrin doses. 

CPP-115 has also been submitted to the Anticonvulsant Screening Program (ASP) of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), one of the institutes within the National Institutes of Health (NIH). To date, CPP-115 has been tested in about 20 animal models of epilepsy, including maximal electric shock (MES) in both rats and mice, corneal kindling in mice, minimal clonic seizure (6 Hz) model in mice, and subcutaneous picrotoxin (scPIC). CPP-115 has shown significant potential in a variety of epilepsy models. Due to change in focus and budgetary constraints, the ASP has suspended further testing of a variety of potential anticonvulsant drugs, including CPP-115. Samples of CPP-115 remain on file at NIH, and we will provide additional material to the NIH upon request for future testing, should it be resumed. There can be no assurance that the ASP will conduct any further testing of CPP-115. 

Northwestern University License Agreement 

On August 27, 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Northwestern University (Northwestern), under which we acquired worldwide rights to commercialize new GABA aminotransferase inhibitors and derivatives of vigabatrin which had been discovered and patented by Northwestern. Under the terms of the license agreement, Northwestern granted us an exclusive worldwide license to United States composition of matter patents related to the new class of inhibitors and a patent application relating to derivatives of vigabatrin. This includes U.S. patent number 6,794,413 covering the composition of matter for CPP-115. We have designated the lead compound to be developed under this license as CPP-115. 

&#160;

We believe that these licensed compounds are the only known GABA aminotransferase inhibitors in existence or in development other than vigabatrin. We also believe, based on our non-clinical testing to date of CPP-115, that these compounds are significantly more potent than vigabatrin with less visual side effects than vigabatrin. We plan to seek to develop these compounds for the treatment of several indications, including epilepsy (specifically, complex partial seizures and infantile spasms). However, these compounds are at an early stage of development and there can be no assurance as to whether these new compounds will ever be determined to be safe and effective. 

Under our license agreement with Northwestern, we will be responsible for continued research and development of any resulting drug candidates. We have the right to terminate the agreement in whole or in part after August 27, 2012, upon written notice. As of December 31, 2015, we have paid Northwestern upfront payments, milestone fees and maintenance and patent fees aggregating $406,590, and we are obligated to pay certain additional fees and milestone payments in future years relating to our clinical development activities under this license or payable upon passage of time. We are also obligated to pay Northwestern royalties on any products resulting from the license agreement. We also have the right to enter into sub-license agreements, and if we do, a royalty on any sub-license fees will be payable to Northwestern.

In March 2015 the U.S. Patent &#38; Trademark Office (US PTO) issued a patent 8,969,413 for the method of use patent for CPP-115 for neurological and psychological uses. This patent will expire in 2032, subject to potential extensions allowed under the patent term restoration act. A continuation application was filed to capture additional methods of using CPP for neurological and psychological conditions. This continuation application has not yet undergone substantive examination. Patents for the same coverage remain pending in the European Patent Office, Japan and Canada. There can be no assurance that the claims of this patent will be allowed, or if allowed, that such claims will provide adequate patent protection for CPP-115. 

CPP-109 

CPP-109 and CPP-115 for the treatment of Tourette&#146;s Disorder and related license agreement 

We, as a co-inventor with scientists at New York University and the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, have filed patent applications in the United States, European and Canadian Patent Offices for the use of GABA aminotransferase inhibitors, including CPP-109 and CPP-115, in the treatment of Tourette&#146;s Disorder. We also have entered into a license agreement with NYU and the Feinstein Institute granting us worldwide rights with respect to such patent.

Tourette&#146;s Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple tics, which are repetitive, non-rhythmic involuntary movements and vocalizations that persist for more than one year. Onset occurs in most children by about age five to six years. Some of the more common simple motor tics include eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, and head or neck jerking. Common simple vocal tics, include grunting, throat clearing, coughing and squeaking. Among the most dramatic and disabling complex tics are those that result in self-harm, such as punching or poking oneself, or complex vocal tics such as coprolalia (uttering swear words) or echolalia (repeating the words or phrases of others). Many patients with Tourette&#146;s Disorder experience additional neurobehavioral problems including inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts/worries and repetitive rituals. 

&#160;

Tourette&#146;s Disorder occurs in all ethnic groups; males are affected three to four times more often than females. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in 2012 Tourette&#146;s Disorder prevalence estimates from a national, telephone-based survey in which they asked parents if their children had received a diagnosis of the disorder. The trial found that approximately 1 out of every 360 children have Tourette&#146;s Disorder, but it is thought that this underestimates the true occurrence of the disorder (the CDC notes that other studies using different methods have estimated the rate of Tourette&#146;s Disorder at 1 out of every 162 children). The prevalence of Tourette&#146;s Disorder in adults is expected to be significantly less than in children as tic symptoms generally abate in later adolescence or early adulthood. 

Tourette&#146;s Disorder is generally treated by a combination of therapy and psychiatric medication. Tics can be treated with medications such as clonidine (Catapres &#174; ), haloperidol (Haldol &#174; ), pimazide (Orap &#174; ), or fluphenazine (Prolixin &#174; ). Medications used to treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder can also be used, such as clomipramine (Anafranil &#174; ), fluoxetine (Prozac &#174; ) and sertraline (Zoloft &#174; ), as well as stimulants used to treat ADHD, a disorder commonly comorbid with Tourette&#146;s Disorder, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin &#174; ), pemoline (Cylert &#174; ) and dextroamphetamine (Dexadrine &#174; ). 

During June 2015, we announced the top-line results of an academic investigator proof-of-concept study evaluating the use of CPP-109 for the treatment of Tourette&#146;s Disorder. The 8-week, four subject open label study was designed as an open label trial to evaluate the potential effect of GABA-aminotransferase inhibition as a mechanism for reducing tics in patients with treatment-refractory Tourette&#146;s Disorder. The most common side-effects were daytime tiredness, and one subject experienced an increase in moodiness and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Vigabatrin was used as a &#147;research surrogate&#148; in this study to demonstrate the utility of GABA-aminotransferase (GABA-AT) blockade, with the expectation that upon successfully demonstrating the utility of this mechanism, further development activities would focus on the potentially safer, more potent GABA-AT inhibitor, CPP-115. 

We believe that the top-line results from this study suggest an encouraging signal of activity in adult treatment-refractory patients with Tourette&#146;s Disorder. Further, we believe that CPP-109&#146;s mechanism of action validates the potential for CPP-115 to be a candidate for the treatment of Tourette&#146;s Disorder. However, there can be no assurance that CPP-115 will be effective for the treatment of refractory patients with Tourette&#146;s Disorder. 

In February 2016, the US PTO issued U.S. Patent 9,254,274 for a method of treating Tourette&#146;s Disorder using the entire class of GABA-aminotransferase inactivators, including CPP-115 and vigabatrin (marketed in the U.S. by Lundbeck as Sabril &#174; ). This patent is expected to expire no earlier than its twenty-year term in January 2033. The expiration of this patent could also be extended by up to 5 years under the patent term restoration act, depending on the review and approval of a new drug application for a new chemical entity claimed in this patent and upon the indication approved for that drug. A continuation in part application including new data was filed prior to the patent issuance. No substantive examination of this new application is expected prior to 2017. 

Generic Sabril &#174; 

In September 2015, we announced the launch of a program to develop CPP-109 as a generic version of Sabril &#174; , which is marketed in the United States by Lundbeck. Lundbeck&#146;s exclusivity for Sabril &#174; expires on April 26, 2017. Because of our prior experience developing our version of vigabatrin (CPP-109), we believe we are well positioned to develop and seek approval for a generic version of Sabril &#174; . 

To date, we have: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; obtained the reference listed drug and the active pharmaceutical ingredient; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; entered into an exclusive supply agreement for the vigabatrin active pharmaceutical ingredient with a manufacturer that has filed a DMF, validated the manufacturing process, and prepared a number of batches of vigabatrin for us on a commercial scale in the past; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; developed and validated quality control and stability test methods; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; conducted a bioequivalence study of CPP-109 against the European equivalent of Sabril (marketed by Sanofi Aventis); and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; collected stability data showing that CPP-109 has an acceptable shelf life in two container closure systems. We are presently taking the steps required to undertake the bioequivalence and other studies that must be successfully completed before we will be in a position to submit an ANDA for this product. There can be no assurance that we can design a bioequivalence study for this product that will be acceptable to the FDA, and even if our study design is deemed acceptable, whether any such study will be successful. In addition, approved versions of vigabatrin are subject to an FDA-mandated REMS program due to the risks of visual field damage and are only available through a special restricted distribution program approved by the FDA. Our generic version of Sabril &#174; , if approved, will be required to share that REMS program or we will be required to develop a comparable REMS program subject to FDA review and approval. There can also be no assurance any ANDA that we submit for this product will be approved. 

Intellectual Property Rights 

Protection of our intellectual property and proprietary technology is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws along with institutional know-how and continuing technological advancement, to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our ability to protect and use our intellectual property rights in the future development and commercialization of our products, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights, is crucial to our future success. See Item 1A. &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.&#148; 

Manufacturing and Supply 

We have no plans to build or acquire the manufacturing capability needed to prepare any of our products. We expect that our drug products will be prepared by contractors with suitable capabilities for these tasks and that we will enter into appropriate supply agreements with these contractors at appropriate times in the development and commercialization of our products. Because we will use contractors to manufacture and supply our products, we will be reliant on such contractors. Further, the contractors selected would have to be inspected by the FDA and found to be in substantial compliance with federal regulations in order for an NDA for one of our drug candidates to be approved, and there can be no assurance that the contractors we select would pass such an inspection. 

Firdapse &#174; 

We have entered into agreements with a supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) contained in Firdapse &#174; for future requirements and we have contracted with a third-party contract manufacturer who will manufacture Firdapse &#174; tablets for us assuming Firdapse &#174; is approved for commercialization. 

Any NDA that we submit for Firdapse &#174; must include a manufacturing plan. If the manufacturing plan and data are insufficient, any NDA we submit will not be approved. Before an NDA can be approved, our manufacturer must also demonstrate compliance with FDA&#146;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) regulations and policies. Further, even if we receive approval of an NDA for Firdapse &#174; , if our manufacturer does not follow cGMPs in the manufacture of our products, it may delay product launches or shipments or adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

Since we contract with a third party to manufacture our products, if the FDA approves an NDA for Firdapse &#174; , our contract manufacturer will be required to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect the manufacturing process. As a result, we do not believe that we will have any significant exposure to environmental issues. 

CPP-115 

We have entered into a contract to manufacture the API sufficient to meet the needs of our ongoing and planned pre-clinical and clinical studies of CPP-115. While we believe that we have ordered and obtained sufficient API for our planned upcoming studies, there can be no assurance of this. 

CPP-109 

In preparation for the potential future marketing of CPP-109 as a generic version of Sabril &#174; , we have entered into supply agreements for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of CPP-109. Additionally, our contract manufacturer of the finished dosage form of CPP-109 has previously developed a manufacturing process for the drug product and prepared several commercial scale batches. We have recently entered into contracts with this manufacturer regarding a contract for the manufacture of commercial batches. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates. 

We are taking steps to prepare for the commercialization of Firdapse &#174; in the United States. This has included the September 2015 hiring of Paul J. Merrigan as our Chief Commercial Officer. We have also hired several key individuals to begin to build our commercial organization who, together with Mr. Merrigan, are working to develop our commercial plans and operations. With respect to the marketing of Firdapse &#174; , we intend to develop an internal sales force of approximately 15-20 representatives experienced in creating awareness of rare diseases and promoting products that treat rare diseases to promote Firdapse &#174; to the approximately 900 neuromuscular specialists who we believe most often diagnose and treat neuromuscular diseases such as LEMS and CMS. We are also currently working with several rare disease advocacy organizations to help increase awareness of LEMS and CMS and to provide and support education for the physicians who treat these rare diseases and the patients they treat. We also plan to introduce and support a comprehensive offering of patient services, including patient assistance programs to eligible patients. We further expect to distribute our product through a network of specialty pharmacies with a single dedicated case management hub responsible for interfacing with patients, physicians and payors. 

Further, as part of our commitment to the healthcare professional community, we expect to deploy a medical field organization with several medical science liaisons to support the physicians and their staff who treat patients with the diseases our products are indicated to treat. We also intend to hire several market access account managers who will supplement the efforts of our medical organization to educate payors in an effort to facilitate and gain insurance coverage. 

In the future, we may consider entering into arrangements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the marketing and sale of Firdapse &#174; in Canada or Mexico, where we have also licensed the product. 

&#160;

Competition 

The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed or licensed by us would likely compete with currently marketed and potentially new drugs and therapies even though they are not indicated for these conditions. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of orphan diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources than we have. 

Firdapse &#174; for LEMS 

LEMS is currently treated with unapproved drugs and therapies including steroids, azathioprine, other immunosuppressants and intravenous immunoglobulin, which work by suppressing the immune system, and pyridostigmine. Plasma exchange has also been used in an attempt to remove antibodies from the body. Further, one other product, guanidine HCl tablets, was approved many years ago (during a period when drugs were not required to be reviewed by the FDA for both safety and effectiveness) for use in the treatment of LEMS. However, this drug has significant side effects and is not currently viewed as an effective treatment for LEMS. Notwithstanding, drugs may be prescribed by physicians for the treatment of LEMS whether or not they are considered effective. 

Another pharmaceutical company, Jacobus Pharmaceutical, has completed a Phase 2 trial studying its own formulation of amifampridine for the treatment of LEMS. While there can be no assurance, we believe that Firdapse &#174; is further along in development than this other company&#146;s version of amifampridine. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the first pharmaceutical product to get approval for an indication receives the orphan exclusivity under the statute. If this other pharmaceutical company is able to receive approval of an NDA for its formulation of amifampridine for the treatment of LEMS before we are able to receive approval of Firdapse &#174; for the same indication, we would be barred from marketing Firdapse &#174; in the United States during the seven-year orphan exclusivity period, which would have a severe adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if this other company were to receive five-year new chemical entity exclusivity for amifampridine for any indication prior to approval of Firdapse &#174; , we would be barred from marketing Firdapse &#174; in the United States during this five-year exclusivity period for any indication. Further, we are aware that Jacobus Pharmaceutical has been making 3,4-DAP available to LEMS patients under compassionate use Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) for a number of years and, based on current information, we believe that approximately 200 LEMS patients may be receiving the drug under their program. If we are the first to obtain an approval for this product and its associated exclusivity and patent protection, we may not be able to stop Jacobus Pharmaceutical from continuing to supply its existing patients under compassionate use INDs. 

Finally, we are aware that amifampridine has been available from compounding pharmacies for many years and may remain available, even if we are able to obtain FDA approval of Firdapse &#174; . Compounded amifampridine, if it remains available, is likely to be substantially less expensive than Firdapse &#174; . The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 included a new section, which clarified the status of pharmacy compounding under Federal law. Under section 503A, drug products that are compounded by a pharmacist or physician for an individual patient may be entitled to exemptions from three key provisions of the act: (1) the adulteration provision of section 501(a)(2)(B) (concerning the good manufacturing practice requirements); (2) the misbranding provision of section 502(f)(1) (concerning the labeling of drugs with adequate directions for use); and (3) the new drug provision of section 505 (concerning the approval of drugs under new drug or abbreviated new drug applications). 

&#160;

To qualify for these statutory exemptions, a compounded drug product must satisfy several requirements. One of these requirements restricted the universe of bulk drug substances that a compounder may use; i.e. that every bulk drug substance used in compounding: (1) must comply with an applicable and current USP or NF monograph, if one exists, as well as the current USP chapter on pharmacy compounding; (2) if such a monograph does not exist, the bulk drug substance must be a component of an FDA-approved drug; or (3) if a monograph does not exist and the bulk drug substance is not a component of an FDA-approved drug, it must appear on a list of bulk drug substances that may be used in compounding (i.e., the bulk drugs list). While Section 503 was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2002, the FDA has continued to aggressively oversee the practice of compounding under a compliance policy guide utilizing its discretion under the principles described above, and these principles were codified into a new section 503A passed by Congress as part of the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA). While FDA has been aggressively enforcing section 503A since its enactment, compounders still may attempt to compound copies of approved drug products, under section 503A, so long as the prescriber makes a change to the compounded formulation that creates a difference between the commercially available drug and the compounded version for that particular patient.

The FDA&#146;s Pharmacy Compounding Advisory Committee at its meeting on May 6-7, 1999 voted 7-4 against inclusion of 3,4-DAP on the bulk drugs list, largely based on the safety concerns and the commitment of Jacobus Pharmaceutical to make the drug available under compassionate use INDs, while pursuing FDA approval. Therefore, since 3,4-DAP does not meet the requirements codified in Section 503A described above, the individual or firm that compounds a drug product containing 3,4-DAP may be subject to a warning letter, seizure of product, injunction, and/or criminal prosecution for violations of the FD&#38;C Act. After the re-enactment of section 503A, and the enactment of new section 503B of the DQSA (i.e., permitting sterile compounding for office use by outsourcing facilities), certain entities nominated 3,4 DAP as a bulk substance to be used in compounding under both reenacted section 503A and under the newly enacted section 503B. As of October 2015, FDA included 3,4-DAP in its Bulks Substance &#147;List 3&#148; under both section 503A and section 503B&#150; which list includes bulk drug products that may not currently be used in compounding because there is insufficient clinical evidence to support their use. 

We intend to take all available steps to try to enforce our marketing proprietary rights if we are the first company to obtain an approval for this product. We cannot determine with certainty what impact these factors will have on the market for our product. However, while there can be no assurance, we expect that despite these factors, we will be able to successfully market our product. 

CPP-115 for Epilepsy 

The market for epilepsy treatments is highly competitive. Large pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer (Neurontin &#174; , Lyrica &#174; , Dilantin &#174; , Zarontin &#174; ), J&#38;J (Topamax &#174; ), UCB (Keppra &#174; ), Abbott (Depakote &#174; ), GSK (Lamictal &#174; ), Roche (Klonopin &#174; ), and Novartis (Trileptal &#174; ) sell, or are developing, epilepsy therapies. However, as stated earlier, approximately one-third of all epilepsy patients are refractory to treatment with any currently available epilepsy treatments. It is difficult to determine sales of products specifically for epilepsy as many of these products are used in other indications such as neuropathic pain, migraine, dementia, and bipolar disorders. 

Factors affecting competition generally 

In general, our ability to compete will depend in large part upon: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the efficacy, safety and reliability of our drug candidates; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the timing and scope of regulatory approvals; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; protection of our proprietary rights and the level of generic competition; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the speed at which we develop drug candidates; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product to the market; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to obtain reimbursement from private and/or public insurance entities for product use in approved indications; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the availability of capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities, including the availability of funding from the federal government. Regulatory Matters 

Government regulation and product approval 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, record-keeping, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our drugs must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. 

In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state statutes. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to the FDA&#146;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; &#160;

&#149; &#160; submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before the trials are initiated; &#160;

&#149; &#160; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; &#160;

&#149; &#160; submission to, and acceptance by, the FDA of an NDA; &#160;

&#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity; &#160;

&#149; &#160; potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and &#160;

&#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA. United States drug development process 

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Prior to beginning human clinical trials, an IND sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some pre-clinical or non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the pre-clinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30&#150;day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may, at any time, impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with federal regulations and GCP. 

Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before any clinical trial commences at that institution. All research subjects must provide informed consent, and informed consent information must be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to initiation of the trial. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if adverse events or other certain types of other changes occur. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases. A fourth, or post-approval, phase may include additional clinical studies. These phases generally include the following, and may be sequential, or may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are designed to determine the safety of usually single doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting intolerance, as well as evidence of the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. &#160;

&#149; &#160; In Phase 3, if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 (or occasionally Phase 1) studies, the Phase 3 studies will be conducted to further confirm clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded population which may involve geographically diverse clinical trial sites. Generally, but not always, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Phase 4 clinical trials are studies required of or agreed to by a sponsor that are conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement. Failure to promptly conduct Phase 4 clinical trials where necessary could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. While Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 tests are generally required for approval of an NDA, certain drugs may not require one or more steps in the process depending on other testing and the situation involved. Additionally, the FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may stop testing at any time if results show patients being exposed to unnecessary health risks or overly dangerous side effects. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other requirements, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

Special factors with respect to clinical trials and pre-clinical studies conducted by others 

The primary focus of our product development efforts is on our own clinical trials and pre-clinical studies. However, we have in the past supported and will continue in the future to support pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and studies by academic investigators (including members of our scientific advisory committee and academic institutions with which they are affiliated) of the use of our drug candidates that we believe might further the understanding or increase the value of our drug candidates. 

In some cases, in the past, we have provided unrestricted sponsorship funds for such studies and we may do so again in the future. In other cases, we have provided, and may in the future provide, alternative assistance to the investigator, most typically providing drug substance or dosage form as well as matching placebo. We expect to continue supporting investigator-sponsored studies in the future to the extent that they meet criteria acceptable to us. In all cases, we seek to assist investigators in designing their studies so that such studies are most appropriately conducted and, to the extent possible, to make sure that these investigator studies potentially complement, and do not adversely impact, our activities. 

&#160;

United States review and approval process 

FDA approval of an NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and composition of the product. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of the NDA to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before accepting it for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The submission of an NDA is also subject to the payment of a substantial application fee (for FDA fiscal year 2016 this fee is $2,374,200), although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, including when the drug that is subject of the application has received Orphan Drug Designation for the indication sought. Further, the sponsor of an approved NDA is subject to annual product and establishment user fees, which for FDA fiscal year 2016 are $114,450 per product and $585,200 per establishment. Application, product, and establishment fees increase annually. The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured to determine whether its manufacturing is cGMP&#150;compliant to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality, purity and stability. 

If the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the NDA submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue a complete response letter. The complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and often requires additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even after submitting this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA may withhold approval of a NDA regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor. 

Post-approval requirements and consideration 

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may also require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for the healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. 

&#160;

Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments 

Orange Book Listing 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant&#146;s product or methods of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#146;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#147;generic equivalents&#148; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 

The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#146;s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

&#160;

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#146;s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 

Exclusivity 

Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. A drug may obtain a three-year period of exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for the previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. During this period of exclusivity, FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. 

An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 

Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2), NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on FDA&#146;s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. 

505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA&#146;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness or published literature is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain pre-clinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three years of marketing exclusivity to the same extent that a Section 505(b)(1) NDA is. 

&#160;

Abbreviated new drug applications 

Generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA. The ANDA development process typically does not require new pre-clinical or clinical studies, but it does typically require one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved brand name reference listed drug. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug product with that of the approved listed product containing the same active ingredient. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. A demonstration of bioequivalence means that the rate and extent of absorption of the ANDA drug is not significantly different from the rate and extent of absorption of the brand name reference listed drug when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions. 

As noted above, generic drug products are generally introduced to the marketplace at the expiration of patent protection and non-patent market exclusivity for the reference listed drug. However, if an ANDA applicant is the first ANDA applicant to submit an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification, that ANDA may be eligible for a period of generic marketing exclusivity on approval. This exclusivity, which under certain circumstances must be shared with other ANDA applicants with Paragraph IV certifications, lasts for 180 days, during which the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA sponsors of an application for a generic equivalent to the same reference drug. Under certain circumstances, eligibility for 180-day exclusivity may be forfeited. 

Various types of changes to an approved ANDA must be requested in a prior approval supplement. In addition, some changes may only be approved only after new bioequivalence studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied. In addition, the ANDA applicant must demonstrate that manufacturing procedures and operations conform to FDA cGMP requirements. Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and inspections to determine whether the systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. 

There are also user fees for ANDA applicants, sponsors, and manufacturers. For fiscal year 2016, the fees are $76,030 per ANDA application, $38,020 per ANDA prior approval supplement, and facility fees of $243,905 per domestic final dosage form facility, $258,905 per foreign final dosage form facility, $40,867 per domestic active pharmaceutical ingredient facility, and $55,867 per foreign active pharmaceutical ingredient facility. These user fees typically increase each fiscal year. 

Other regulatory requirements 

In addition to regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies, we are also subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the marketing of other products. Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory agencies. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, we will only be permitted to commercialize our products if the appropriate regulatory agency is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The regulatory approval and oversight process in other countries includes all of the risks associated with regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies as described above. 

&#160;

Under the European Union regulatory system, applications for drug approval may be submitted either in a centralized or decentralized manner. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Agency leads to an approval granted by the European Commission which permits marketing of the product throughout the European Union. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of nationally approved decisions and is used for products that do not comply with requirements for the centralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, the holders of national marketing authorization in one of the countries within the European Union may submit further applications to other countries within the European Union, who will be requested to recognize the original authorization based on an assessment report provided by the country in which marketing authorization is held. 

Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 

In both US and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private commercial health insurers and PBMs. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic or other studies in order to further demonstrate the value of our products. Even with the availability of such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than alternative products, and third party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our drug candidates, in whole or in part. 

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. We anticipate that in the US, Congress, state legislatures, and private sector entities will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; controls on healthcare providers; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; reform of drug importation laws; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; entering into contractual agreements with payors; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expansion of use of managed-care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. 

&#160;

Further, the pricing of pharmaceutical products generally, and particularly the pricing of orphan drugs, has recently received scrutiny from the press, from members of Congress and from several candidates currently running for President of the United States. Some members of the medical community have also weighed in in the press on the potential pricing of our product. The impact of this scrutiny on us and on the pricing of orphan drugs and other pharmaceutical products generally cannot be determined with any certainty at this time. 

Orphan Drug Exclusivity and Pediatric Exclusivity Designation 

Some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (ODA), the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. In the United States, Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An Orphan Drug Designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The grant of an Orphan Drug Designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has been granted Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the U.S. and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and seven-year orphan exclusivities. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or Biologic License Application sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly responds to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If the FDA determines that information relating to the use of the new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in the population, the clinical study is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#146;s request and the reports of FDA-requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application relying on the NDA sponsor&#146;s data. 

The European Orphan Drug Regulation is considered for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition afflicting five or fewer per 10,000 people in the EU, including compounds that for serious and chronic conditions would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsor&#146;s development investment. The medicinal product considered should be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Benefits of being granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation are significant, including eight years of data exclusivity, two years of marketing exclusivity and a potential one-year extension of both. The EU Community and Member States may not accept or grant for ten years a new marketing authorization or application for another drug for the same therapeutic indication as the orphan drug, although the ten year period can be reduced to six years if, after the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of the marketing exclusivity. A supplementary protection certificate may extend the protection six months beyond patent expiration if that is later than the orphan drug exclusivity period. To apply for the supplementary protection, a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, must be included in the market application. In Europe all drugs now seeking marketing authorization need to have a PIP agreed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before it can be approved, even if it is a drug being developed specifically for a pediatric indication. If a product is developed solely for use in the pediatric population, then a Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization, or PUMA, may provide eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of marketing exclusivity. 

&#160;

Breakthrough Therapy Designation 

Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for breakthrough therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. A breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the fast track program features (see below for more details on fast track designation), as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program. The FDA also has an organizational commitment to involve senior management in such guidance. Actions taken to expedite development may include the following actions, as appropriate: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; holding meetings with the sponsor and review team throughout the development of the drug; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the non-clinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as possible; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the cross-discipline members of the review team (i.e., clinical, pharmacology-toxicology, chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC), compliance) for coordinated internal interactions and communications with the sponsor through the review division&#146;s Regulatory Health Project Manager; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review. Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 

FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request. 

&#160;

Under the fast track program and FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 

In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA. 

In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug&#146;s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA&#146;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

Priority Review 

Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within a six to eight-month time frame from the time a complete NDA is submitted, if the drug candidate is intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious or life-threatening condition, demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs. 

Disclosure of clinical trial information 

Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 

Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws &#38; the Prescription Drug Marketing Act 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, other state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 

&#160;

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. 

The Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of approved prescription drugs to begin collecting and reporting information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers were required to begin collecting information in 2013, with the first reports due in 2014. The information reported each year is made publicly available on a searchable website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.

In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 

As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling, and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.
