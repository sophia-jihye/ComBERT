 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Description of Business 

&#160; 

Denny&#8217;s Corporation (Denny&#8217;s) is one of America&#8217;s largest franchised full-service restaurant chains based on the number of restaurants. Denny&#8217;s, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Denny&#8217;s, Inc., owns and operates the Denny&#8217;s brand. At December 30, 2015 , the Denny&#8217;s brand consisted of 1,710 &#32;franchised, licensed and company operated restaurants around the world with combined sales of $2.7 billion , including 1,599 &#32;restaurants in the United States and 111 &#32;international locations. As of December 30, 2015 , 1,546 &#32;of our restaurants were franchised or licensed, representing 90% &#32;of the total restaurants, and 164 &#32;were company operated. 

Denny&#8217;s is known as America's Diner, or in the case of our international locations, &#8220;the local diner.&#8221; Open 24/7 in most locations, we provide our guests quality food that emphasizes everyday value and new products through our compelling limited time only offerings, delivered in a warm, friendly &#8220;come as you are&#8221; atmosphere. Denny's has been serving guests for over 60 years and is best known for its breakfast fare, which is available around the clock. The Original Grand Slam, introduced in 1977, remains one of our most popular menu items. In addition to our breakfast-all-day items, Denny's offers a wide selection of lunch and dinner items including burgers, sandwiches, salads and skillet entr&#233;es, along with an assortment of beverages, appetizers and desserts. 

In 2015 , Denny's average annual restaurant sales were $2.2 million for company restaurants and $1.6 million for franchised restaurants. At our company restaurants, the guest check average was $9.69 with an approximate average of 4,400 guests served per week. Because our restaurants are open 24 hours, we have four dayparts (breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night), accounting for 24%, 35%, 22% and 19%, respectively, of average daily sales at company restaurants. Weekends have traditionally been the most popular time for guests to visit our restaurants. In 2015 , 36% of an average week of sales at company restaurants occurred between Friday late night and Sunday lunch.

Restaurant Development 

Franchising 

&#160; 

Our criteria to become a Denny&#8217;s franchisee include minimum liquidity and net worth requirements and appropriate operational experience. We believe that Denny&#8217;s is an attractive financial proposition for current and potential franchisees and that our fee structure is competitive with other full-service brands. Traditional twenty-year Denny&#8217;s franchise agreements have an initial fee of up to $40,000 and the royalty payment is up to 4.5% of gross sales. Additionally, our franchisees are required to contribute up to 3% of gross sales for brand promotion and may make additional advertising contributions as part of a local marketing co-operative. Franchise agreements for nontraditional locations, such as university campuses and military bases, may contain higher royalty and lower advertising contribution rates than the traditional franchise agreements. For 2015 , our average royalty rate was approximately 4.02% . 

We work closely with our franchisees to plan and execute many aspects of the business. The Denny's Franchisee Association ("DFA") was created to promote communication among our franchisees and between the Company and our franchise community. DFA board members and Company management primarily work together through Brand Advisory Councils relating to Development, Marketing and Operations matters, as well as through a Supply Chain Oversight Committee for procurement and distribution matters. 

&#160; Site Selection 

The success of any restaurant is significantly influenced by its location. Our development team works closely with franchisees and real estate brokers to identify sites which meet specific standards. Sites are evaluated on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

demographics; 

&#8226; 

traffic patterns; 

&#8226; 

visibility; 

&#8226; 

building constraints; 

&#8226; 

competition; 

&#8226; 

environmental restrictions; and 

&#8226; 

proximity to high-traffic consumer activities. 

Domestic Development 

&#160; 

To accelerate the growth of the brand in certain under-penetrated markets, we offer certain incentive programs. These programs provide significant incentives for franchisees to develop multiple locations in areas where Denny's does not have the top market share. The benefits to franchisees include reduced franchise fees, lower royalties for a limited time period and credits towards certain development services, such as training fees. 

In recent years, we have opened restaurant locations within travel centers, primarily with Pilot and Pilot Flying J Travel Centers. At the end of 2015, we opened three new travel center restaurants in partnership with Kwik Trip TM &#32;convenience stores. Additionally, we have opened nontraditional locations on university campuses and military bases operating under the Denny's Fresh Express&#174;, Denny's AllNighter&#174; or The Den&#174; names. 

&#160; 

Through our various development efforts, we currently have approximately 75 domestic franchised restaurants in our development pipeline. The majority of these restaurants are expected to open over the next five years. While we anticipate the majority of the restaurants to be opened under these agreements, generally as scheduled, from time to time some of our franchisees' ability to grow and meet their development commitments may be hampered by the economy, the lending environment or other circumstances. 

&#160; &#160; 

International Development 

&#160; 

In addition to the development agreements signed for domestic restaurants, we have approximately 100 international franchised restaurants in our development pipeline. The international pipeline includes 28 restaurants in the Middle East, 15 in Indonesia, 13 in Canada, ten in Turkey and ten in the Philippines. During 2015 , we opened eight franchised international locations, including four in Canada, two in the United Arab Emirates and two in the Dominican Republic. 

During 2016, we expect to open a total of 40 to 45 franchised restaurants in domestic and international markets, resulting in net growth of five to ten restaurants. 

&#160; 

Franchise Focused Business Model 

Through our development and refranchising efforts we have achieved a restaurant portfolio mix of 90% franchised and 10% company operated. The majority of our future restaurant openings and growth of the brand will come primarily from the development of franchised restaurants. The following table summarizes the changes in the number of company restaurants and franchised and licensed restaurants during the past five years (excluding relocations):

&#160; Restaurant Operations 

&#160; 

We believe that the consistent and reliable execution of basic restaurant operations in each Denny&#8217;s restaurant, whether it is company or franchised, is critical to our success. To meet and exceed our guests&#8217; expectations, we require both our company and our franchised restaurants to maintain the same strict brand standards. These standards relate to the preparation and efficient serving of quality food and the maintenance, repair and cleanliness of each restaurant. 

We devote significant effort to ensuring all restaurants offer quality food served by friendly, knowledgeable and attentive employees in a clean and well-maintained restaurant. We seek to ensure that our company restaurants meet our high standards through a network of Directors of Company Operations, Company District Managers and restaurant level managers, all of whom spend the majority of their time in the restaurants. A network of Regional Directors of Franchise Operations and Franchise Business Leaders provide oversight of our franchised restaurants to ensure compliance with brand standards, promote operational excellence and provide general support to our franchisees. 

A principal feature of our restaurant operations is the consistent focus on improving operations at the restaurant level. Our Pride Review Program, executed by a team of coaches, is designed to continuously improve the execution of our brand standards and shift management at each company and franchised restaurant. In addition, Denny&#8217;s maintains training programs for hourly employees and restaurant management. Hourly employee training programs (including eLearning) are position-specific and focus on skills and tasks necessary to successfully fulfill the responsibilities assigned to them, while continually enhancing guest satisfaction. Denny's Manager In Training (&#8220;MIT&#8221;) program provides managers with the knowledge and leadership skills needed to successfully operate a Denny's restaurant. The MIT program is required for all new managers of company restaurants and is also available to Denny's franchisees to train their managers. 

Product Development and Marketing 

Menu Offerings 

The Denny&#8217;s menu offers a large selection of high-quality, moderately priced products designed to appeal to all types of guests. We offer a wide variety of items for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night dining, in addition to appetizers, desserts and beverages. Our Fit Fare&#174; menu helps our guests identify items best suited to their dietary needs. Most Denny&#8217;s restaurants offer special items for children and seniors at reduced prices. Our &#8220;America&#8217;s Diner" brand positioning, which provides the promise of Everyday Value with craveable, indulgent products served in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, establishes the framework for our primary marketing strategies. These strategies focus on optimizing our product offering to further align with consumer needs, which includes enhancing our core "breakfast all day" platform while providing everyday affordability, primarily through our $2 $4 $6 $8 Value Menu&#174; and delivering compelling limited-time-only products. 

Product Development 

&#160; 

Denny&#8217;s is a consumer-driven brand focusing on hospitality, menu choices and the overall guest experience. Our Product Development team works closely with consumer insights obtained through primary and secondary qualitative and quantitative studies. Input and ideas from our franchisees, vendors and operators are also integrated into this process. These insights form the strategic foundation for menu architecture, pricing, promotion and advertising. Before a new menu item can be brought to fruition, it is rigorously tested against consumer expectations, standards of culinary discipline, food science and technology, nutritional analysis, financial benefit and operational execution. This testing process ensures that new menu items are not only appealing, competitive, profitable and marketable, but can be prepared and delivered with excellence in our restaurants. 

The added value of these insights and strategic understandings also assists our Restaurant Operations and Information Technology staff in the evaluation and development of new restaurant processes and upgraded restaurant equipment that may enhance our speed of service, food quality and order accuracy. 

&#160; 

We continually evolve our menu through new additions, deletions or improvements to meet the needs of a changing consumer and market place. 

Product Sources and Availability 

&#160; 

Our Purchasing department administers programs for the procurement of food and non-food products. Our franchisees also purchase food and non-food products directly from the vendors under these programs. Our centralized purchasing program is designed to ensure uniform product quality as well as to minimize food, beverage and supply costs. Our size provides significant purchasing power, which often enables us to obtain products at favorable prices from nationally recognized manufacturers. 

&#160; 

While nearly all products used in our restaurants are contracted for by our Purchasing department, the majority are purchased and distributed through Meadowbrook Meat Company ("MBM"), a wholly owned subsidiary of McLane Company, Inc., under a long-term distribution contract. MBM distributes restaurant products and supplies to the Denny&#8217;s system from approximately 200 vendors, representing approximately 90% of our restaurant product and supply purchases. We believe that satisfactory alternative sources of supply are generally available for all the items regularly used by our restaurants. We have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, or other products which are necessary to our restaurant operations. 

Marketing and Advertising 

&#160; 

Our Marketing team employs integrated marketing and advertising strategies that promote the Denny&#8217;s brand. Brand and communications strategy, advertising, broadcast media, social media, digital media, menu management, product innovation and development, consumer insights, target segment marketing, public relations, field marketing and national/local promotions and partnerships all fall under the marketing umbrella. 

&#160; 

We focus our marketing campaigns on amplifying Denny's brand strengths as America's Diner, promoting the various breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night and Fit Fare&#174; menu offerings in addition to both value and premium limited time only offerings. Denny's deploys comprehensive marketing strategies on a national level and through local co-operatives, targeting customers through network, cable and local television, radio, online, digital, social, outdoor and print media. 

&#160; 

Brand Protection &#38; Quality 

Denny&#8217;s will only serve our guests food that is safe and wholesome and that meets our quality standards. Our systems, from "farm to fork," are based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points ("HACCP"), whereby we prevent, eliminate or reduce hazards to a safe level to protect the health of the employees and guests. To ensure this basic expectation of our guests, Denny&#8217;s also has risk-based systems in place to validate only approved vendors and distributors which meet and follow our product specifications and food handling procedures. Vendors, distributors and restaurant employees follow regulatory requirements (federal, state and local), industry &#8220;best practices&#8221; and Denny&#8217;s Brand Standards. 

&#160; 

We use multiple approaches to quality including third-party unannounced restaurant inspections (utilizing Denny&#8217;s Brand Protection Reviews), health department reviews and employee/manager training in their respective roles. It is a brand standard that all regulatory reviews/inspections be submitted to the Brand Protection department within 24 hours. We follow-up on all inspections received, and assist Operations and Facilities personnel, as well as franchisees, where applicable, to bring resolution to regulatory issues or concerns. If operational brand standard expectations are not met, a remediation process is immediately initiated. Our HACCP program uses nationally recognized food safety training courses and American National Standards Institute accredited certification programs. 

&#160; 

All Denny&#8217;s restaurants are required to have a person certified in food protection on duty for all hours of operation. Our Food Safety/HACCP program has been recognized nationally by regulatory departments, the restaurant industry and our peers as one of the best. We continuously work toward improving our processes and procedures. We are advocates for the advancement of food safety within the industry&#8217;s organizations, such as the National Council of Chain Restaurants, the National Restaurant Association (NRA) and the NRA's Quality Assurance Executive Study Groups. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Restaurant sales are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth calendar quarters (October through March). Additionally, severe weather, storms and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. 

&#160; 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

&#160; 

Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we have certain trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in international jurisdictions, including "Denny's&#174;", "Grand Slam&#174;", "$2 $4 $6 $8 Value Menu&#174;" and "Fit Fare&#174;". We consider our trademarks and service marks important to the identification of our restaurants and believe they are of material importance to the conduct of our business. Domestic trademark and service mark registrations are renewable at various intervals from 10 to 20 years. International trademark and service mark registrations have various durations from 5 to 20 years. We generally intend to renew trademarks and service marks that come up for renewal. We own or have rights to all trademarks we believe are material to our restaurant operations in the United States and other jurisdictions where we do business. In addition, we have registered various domain names on the internet that incorporate certain of our trademarks and service marks, and believe these domain name registrations are an integral part of our identity. From time to time, we may resort to legal measures to defend and protect the use of our intellectual property. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Restaurants compete on the basis of name recognition and advertising; the price, quality, variety and perceived value of their food offerings; the quality and speed of their guest service; and the convenience and attractiveness of their facilities. 

&#160; 

Denny&#8217;s direct competition in the full-service category includes a collection of national and regional chains, as well as thousands of independent operators. We also compete with quick service restaurants as they attempt to upgrade their menus with premium sandwiches, entr&#233;e salads, new breakfast offerings and extended hours. 

&#160; 

We believe that Denny&#8217;s has a number of competitive strengths, including strong brand recognition, well-located restaurants and market penetration. We benefit from economies of scale in a variety of areas, including advertising, purchasing and distribution. Additionally, we believe that Denny&#8217;s has competitive strengths in the value, variety and quality of our food products, and in the quality and training of our employees. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for certain additional factors relating to our competition in the restaurant industry. 

&#160; 

Economic, Market and Other Conditions 

&#160; 

The restaurant industry is affected by many factors, including changes in national, regional and local economic conditions affecting consumer spending; the political environment (including acts of war and terrorism), changes in customer travel patterns including changes in the price of gasoline; changes in socio-demographic characteristics of areas where restaurants are located; changes in consumer tastes and preferences; food safety and health concerns; outbreaks of flu viruses (such as avian flu) or other diseases; increases in the number of restaurants; and unfavorable trends affecting restaurant operations, such as rising wage rates, health care costs, utilities expenses and unfavorable weather. See "Risk Factors" for additional information. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

We and our franchisees are subject to local, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing various aspects of the restaurant business. 

We are subject to Federal Trade Commission regulation and a number of state laws which regulate the offer and sale of franchises. We also are subject to a number of state laws which regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict the effect on operations of the enactment of additional regulations in the future. 

We are also subject to federal and state laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, governing matters such as minimum wage, tip reporting, overtime, exempt status classification and other working conditions. A substantial number of our employees are paid the minimum wage. Accordingly, increases in the minimum wage or decreases in the allowable tip credit (which reduces wages deemed to be paid to tipped employees in certain states) increase our labor costs. This is especially true for our operations in California, where there is no tip credit. Employers must pay the higher of the federal or state minimum wage. We have attempted to offset increases in the minimum wage through pricing and various cost control efforts, however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts in the future. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act required that most individuals obtain health insurance coverage beginning in 2014 and also required that certain large employers offer coverage to their employees or pay a financial penalty beginning in 2015. We began complying with the laws in 2014. Although we cannot predict with certainty the financial and operational impacts these laws will have on us in the future, we expect that our expenses related to employee health benefits will increase over the long term as a result of these laws. Any such increases could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the health care reform laws will require restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus effective December 1, 2016. We early adopted this requirement during 2015 and did not incur any material costs from compliance with this provision of the law. 

We are subject to governmental regulations in our international markets impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations have not historically had a material impact on our operations; however, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations on our operations.

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 30, 2015 , we had approximately 8,500 employees, of whom 8,100 were restaurant employees, 100 were field support employees and 300 were corporate personnel. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Many of our restaurant employees work part-time, and many are paid at or above minimum wage levels. As is characteristic of the restaurant industry, we experience a high level of turnover among our restaurant employees. We have experienced no significant work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

The staff for a typical restaurant consists of one General Manager, two or three Restaurant Managers and approximately 45 hourly employees. The Chief Operating Officer, along with the VP, Franchise Operations, the VP, Training and the VP, Operations Services, establish the strategic direction and key initiatives for the Operations Teams. In addition, we employ two Directors of Company Operations, four Regional Directors of Franchise Operations and a team of Company District Managers and Franchise Business Leaders to guide and support the franchisees and in-restaurant teams. The duties of the Directors of Operations, District Managers and Franchise Business Leaders include regular restaurant visits and inspections, as well as frequent interactions with our franchisees, employees and guests, which ensure the ongoing adherence to our standards of quality, service, cleanliness, value and hospitality.
