Customers, Services and Products 

Customers. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular provides service to postpaid and prepaid customers from a variety of demographic segments. U.S. Cellular focuses on retail consumers, government, and small-to-mid-size business customers in industries such as construction, retail, professional services and real estate. &#160; These customers are served primarily through U.S. Cellular&#8217;s retail and direct sales channels. U.S. Cellular builds customer loyalty by offering high-quality network services, outstanding customer - focused support services, effective pricing, and other benefits as discussed further in &#8220;Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales and Distribution Channels.&#8221; 

Services. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s postpaid customers are able to choose from a variety of national plans with voice, messaging and data usage options and pricing that are designed to fit different customer needs, usage patterns and budgets. &#160; Helping a customer find the right pricing plan is an important element of U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s brand positioning. &#160; U.S. Cellular offers Shared Connect d ata plans wh ich allow customers to share data usage among all users and devices connected to the plan. &#160; Business rate plans are designed to meet the unique needs of the business customer. &#160; U.S. Cellular&#8217;s national plans price all domestic calls as local calls, regardless of where they are made or received in the United States, with no long distance or roaming charges , and can do so through the existence of roaming partnerships. &#160; U.S. Cellular also offers monthly prepaid service plans, which provide customers unlimited voice and unlimited messaging with a specified amount of high - speed data and unlimited data at lower speeds once the high - speed data limit is reached to ensure customers are never witho ut data access . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. Cellular&#8217;s portfolio of smartphones, tablets and other connected devices is a key part of its strategy to deliver wireless devices which allow customers to stay productive, entertained and connected on the go ; these devices are backed by U.S. Cellular&#8217;s high-speed networks, including a fourth generation (&#8220; 4G &#8221;) Long-Term Evolution (&#8220; LTE &#8221;) network, which, as of December 31, 2015 , covered 99% of its postpaid customers and supports nationwide roaming . &#160; U.S. C ellular&#8217;s 4G LTE network features smartphone messaging, data and internet services that allow customers to access the web and social network sites, e-mail, text, picture and video message, utilize turn-by-turn GPS navigation, and browse and download thousands of applications to customize their wireless de vices to fit their lifestyles. &#160; 

In 2015, U.S. Cellular expanded its solutions to business and government customers, including a growing suite of machine to machine solutions across the categories of monitor and control (e.g. , sensors and cameras), business automation/operations (e.g. , e-forms), communication (e.g. , back-up router for business continuity services) and asset management (e.g. , fleet management). U.S. Cellular intends to continue to further enhance its advanced wireless services and connected solutions for consumer and business customers in 2016 and beyond. 

Devices and Products. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular offers a comprehensive range of wireless devices such as handsets, modems, mobile hotspots, home phone s and tablets for use by its customers. &#160; U.S. Cellular offers wireless devices that are compatible with most of its 4G LTE and third generation (&#8220; 3G &#8221;) networks and a ll are compliant with the Federal Co mmunications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) enhanced wireless 911 requirements. &#160; In addition, U.S. Cellular offers a wide range of accessories, significantly expanding the breadth of products offered, from wireless basics such as carrying cases, hands-free devices, batteries, battery chargers, and memory cards to related consumer electronics such as headphones, speakers, and Bluetooth keyboards. U.S. Cellular also sells wireless devices to agents and other third-party distributors for resale. U.S. &#160; Cellular frequently discou nts wireless devices sold to new and current customers in order to attract new customers or to retain existing customers by reducing the cost of becoming or remaining a wireless customer . U.S. Cellular also offers customers the option to purchase certain devices under installment contracts over a specified time period while providing a discount on their connection charge . &#160; For certain inst allment plans, after a specified period of time, the customer may have the right to upgrade to a new device, thus enabling customers to more easily access the latest smartphones and provide a better overall customer experience. &#160; 

U.S. Cellular continues to offer several programs that allow the customer to receive a replacement device through a retail store or through direct mail. &#160; U.S. Cellular also offers its Device Protection+ program which includes overnight delivery while continuing to provide customers peace of mind by covering lost and stolen devices. 

The devices offered include a full array of value and iconic smartphones and feature phones. During 2015, U.S. Cellular continued to bolster its expanding smartphone and tablet portfolio with Android wireless devices and tablets such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge+, Samsung Galaxy Note 5, LG G4, Motorola G LTE, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, and LG Gpad 8.0, and Apple products such as the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, and the full complement of iPads. &#160; U.S. Cellular&#8217;s smartphone offerings play a significant role in driving data service usage and revenues. &#160; U.S. Cellular also offered additional products and services including LTE wireless routers and hotspots for broadband coverage as well as home phones and OnLook connected home. &#160; 

U.S. Cellular purchases wireless devices and accessory products from a number of manufacturers, including Samsung, Apple, Motorola, LG, Superior Communications, Kyocera, ZTE, Tessco, and Sierra Wireless. U.S. &#160; Cellular negotiates volume discounts with its suppliers and works with them in promoting specific equipment in its local advertising. &#160; U.S. Cellular does not own significant product warehousing and distribution infrastructure. &#160; Instead, it contracts with third party providers for substantially all of its product warehousing, distribution and direct customer fulfillment activities. U.S. Cellular also contracts with third party providers for services related to its device replacement programs. 

U.S. Cellular continuously monitors the financial condition of its wireless device and accessory suppliers. &#160; Because U.S. Cellular purchases wireless devices and accessories from numerous suppliers, U.S. Cellular does not expect the financial condition of any single supplier to affect its ability to offer a competitive variety of wireless devices and accessories for sale to customers. 

Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales and Distribution Channels 

Marketing and Advertising. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s marketing plan is focused on acquiring, retaining and growing customer relationships by maintaining a high-quality wireless network, providing outstanding customer service, and offering a comprehensive portfolio of products and services built around customer needs at fair prices. 

U.S. Cellular believes that creating positive relationships with its customers enhances their wireless experience and builds customer loyalty. &#160; U.S. Cellular currently offers several customer-centric programs and services to customers. &#160; The Overage Protection service provides customers peace of mind by sending them text message alerts when they come close to reaching their allowable monthly plan minutes, text messages or data usage in order to avoid overage charges. &#160; With the launch o f Shared Data plans, whereby customer s select the size of the data bucket to share among all of their lines/devices, U.S. Cellular also offers a service to allow customers to limit data usage on specific lines &#8211; or for the entire account &#8211; thereby providing controls to manage account overages. &#160; This service, Data Usage Controls, allows customers an easy way to split up their data bucket by line. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

U.S. &#160; Cellular increases consumer awareness using media such as television, radio, newspaper, direct mail advertising, digital, social media, and sponsorships. &#160; U.S. Cellular has achieved its current level of penetration of its markets through a combination of a strong brand position, promotional advertising, broad distribution, maintaining a high-quality wireless network and providing outstanding customer service. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s advertising is directed at increasing the public awareness and understanding of the wireless services it offers, improving potential customers&#8217; awareness of the U.S. &#160; Cellular brand, attracting and retaining customers, and increasing existing customers&#8217; usage of U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s services. U.S. &#160; Cellular attempts to select the advertising and promotional media that are most appealing to the targeted groups of potential customers in each local market. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular supplements its advertising with a focused public relations program that drives store traffic, supports sales of products and services, and builds brand awareness and preference. &#160; The approach combines national and local media relations in mainstream and social media channels with market-wide activities, events, and sponsorships. U.S. Cellular focuses its charitable giving strategy on supporting initiatives relevant to consumers in its service areas. &#160; These initiatives include support of programs that focus on youth in the communities U.S. Cellular serves, such as the Boys and Girls Clubs and 4H Societies of America. 

Customer Service. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular manages customer retention by focusing on outstanding customer service through the development of processes that are customer-friendly, extensive training of frontline sales and support associates and the implementation of retention programs. 

U.S. &#160; Cellular currently operates four regional customer care centers in its operating markets with personnel who are responsible for customer service activities, and a national financial services center with personnel who perform credit and other customer payment activities. &#160; U.S. Cellular also contracts with third parties that provide additional customer care and financial services support. 

Sales and Distribution Channels. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular supports a multi-faceted distribution program, including retail sales, direct sales, third-party national retailers, and independent agents, plus a website and telesales. 

Company retail store locations are designed to market wireless products and services to the consumer and small business segments in a setting familiar to these types of customers. &#160; As of December 31, 2015 , retail sales associates work in approximately 270 U.S. Cellular-operated retail stores and kiosks. Direct sales consultants market wireless services to mid-size business customers. Additionally, the U.S. &#160; Cellular website enables customers to activate service and purchase wireless devices online. 

U.S. &#160; Cellular maintains an ongoing training program to improve the effectiveness of retail sales associates and direct sales consultants by focusing their efforts on obtaining customers by facilitating the sale of appropriate packages for the customer&#8217;s expected usage and value-added services that meet the individual needs of the customer. 

U.S. &#160; Cellular has relationships with exclusive and non-exclusive agents, which are independent businesses that obtain customers for U.S. &#160; Cellular on a commission basis. &#160; At December 31, 2015 , U.S. &#160; Cellular had contracts with t hese businesses aggregating 580 locations. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular provides additional support and training to its exclusive agents to increase customer satisfaction and to ensure a consistent customer experience. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s agents are generally in the business of selling wireless devices, wireless service packages and other related products. &#160; No single agent accounted for 10% or more of U.S. Cellular&#8217;s operating revenues during the past three years. 

Since 2013 , U.S. Cellular has expanded its distribution through third-party national and on-line retailers. Wal-Mart, Sam&#8217;s Club, and Dollar General offer U.S. Cellular products and services at select retail locations in U.S. Cellular&#8217;s service areas. Further, Amazon offers U.S. Cellular&#8217;s postpaid and prepaid services on-line. &#160; U.S. Cellular continues to explore new relationships with additional third-party retailers as part of its strategy to expand distribution. 

Seasonality. &#160; &#160; There is seasonality in operating expenses, which tend to be higher in the fourth quarter than in the other quarters due to increased marketing and promotional activities during the holiday season, which may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter. 

Competition 

The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular competes directly with several wireless service providers in each of its markets. In general, there are between two and four competitors in each wireless market in which U.S. Cellular provides service, excluding resellers and mobile virtual network operators. In its footprint, U.S. Cellular competes to varying degrees against each of the national wireless companies: Verizon Wireless, AT&#38;T Mobility, Sprint, and T-Mobile USA, in addition to a few smaller regional carriers in specific areas of its footprint. &#160; Verizon is U.S. Cellular&#8217;s largest competitor, in terms of both customer acquisition opportunities and customer defection risk in the majority of its markets. However, all of the national competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than U.S. &#160; Cellular. Additionally, U.S. Cellular competes with other companies that use alternative communication technology and services to provide similar products and services. 

Since each of these wireless competitors operates on systems using spectrum licensed by the FCC and has comparable technology and facilities, competition among wireless service providers for customers is principally on the basis of types of products and services, price, size of area covered, network quality, network speed and responsiveness of customer service. &#160; U.S. Cellular employs a customer satisfaction strategy that includes maintaining an outstanding wireless network throughout its markets. &#160; U.S. Cellular owns and operates low-band spectrum (less than 1 GHz) that covers the majority of its footprint and enables more efficient, superior coverage in rural areas (compared to spectrum above 1 GHz), which strengthens its network quality positioning. As discusse d below , the FCC will be auctioning low band (600MHz) spectrum in 2016. To the extent existing competitors or new entrants acquire such spectrum in U.S. C ellular markets, U.S. Cellular c ould face increased competition over time from competitors that hold such more-efficient and superior low-band spectrum. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The use of national advertising and promotional programs by the top four wireless service providers is a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures in all U.S. Cellular markets, even if those operators do not provide direct service in a particular market. &#160; Over the past year, competition among top carriers has continued to be aggressive, with the top four carriers engaging in rich promotional initiatives including contract buyouts and limited-time and permanent price reductions. &#160; In addition, in the current wireless environment, U.S. Cellular&#8217;s ability to compete depends on its ability to continue to offer national voice and data plans. U.S. Cellular provides wireless services comparable to the national competitors, but the national wireless companies operate in a wider geographic area and are able to offer no - cost roaming over a wider area on their own networks than U.S. Cellular can offer on its network. &#160; Although U.S. Cellular offers the same coverage area as these competitors, U.S. Cellular incurs roaming charges for data sessions and calls made in portions of the coverage area which are not part of its network, thereby increasing its cost of operations. U.S. Cellular depends on roaming agreements with other wireless carriers to provide voice and data roaming capabilities in areas not covered by U.S. Cellular&#8217;s network. Similarly, U.S. Cellular provides roaming services on its network to other wireless carriers&#8217; customers who travel within U.S. Cellular&#8217;s coverage areas. 

Convergence of connectivity is taking place on many levels, including dual-mode wirel ess devices that act as wireless or wireline devices depending on location and the incorporation of wireless &#8220;hot spot&#8221; technology in wireless devices making internet access seamless regardless of location. &#160; Although less directly a substitute for other wireless services, wireless data services such as Wi-Fi may be adequate for those who do not need mobile wide-area roaming or full two-way voice services. &#160; Technological advances or regulatory changes in the future, such as the rollout and consumer adoption of Wi-Fi calling and Voice over Long - Term Evolution (&#8220;VoLTE&#8221;) capabilities, may make available other alternatives to current wireless service, thereby creating additional sources of competition that shift consumers&#8217; perceptions and preferences of network strength, speed and reliability. &#160; If the trend toward convergence continues , U.S. Cellular is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such convergence. 

U.S. Cellular&#8217;s approach in 2016 and in future years will be to focus on the unique needs and attitudes of its customers towards wireless service. U.S. Cellular will deliver high- quality products and services at competitive prices and intends to continue to differentiate itself by seeking to provide an overall outstanding custom er experience, including a high- quality network. U.S. Cellular&#8217;s ability to compete successfully in the future will depend upon its ability to anticipate and respond to changes related to new service offerings, consumer preferences, competitors&#8217; pricing strategies and new product offerings , technology, demographic trends, economic conditions and its access to adequate spectrum resources. 

System Usage 

U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s main sources of revenues are from its own customers and from customers of competitors who roam on its network. The interoperability of wireless service enables a customer who is in a wireless service area other than the customer&#8217;s home service area to place or receive a call or use data in that service area. &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular has entered into reciprocal roaming agreements with operators of other wireless systems covering virtually all systems with Code Division Multiple Access (&#8220;CDMA&#8221;) technology in the United States, Canada and Mexico. &#160; Roaming agreements offer customers the opportunity to roam on these systems. &#160; These reciprocal agreements automatically pre-register the customers of U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s systems in the other carriers&#8217; systems. &#160; In addition, a customer of a participating system roaming in a U.S. &#160; Cellular market where this arrangement is in effect is able to make and receive calls or data on U.S. &#160; Cellular&#8217;s system. &#160; The charge for this service is negotiated as part of the roaming agreement between U.S. &#160; Cellular and the roaming customer&#8217;s carrier. U.S. &#160; Cellular bills this charge to the customer&#8217;s home carrier, which then may bill the customer. &#160; In many instances, based on competitive factors, carriers, including U.S. &#160; Cellular, generally do not charge their customers for roaming , or charge lower amounts to their customers than the amounts actually charged to them by other wireless carriers for roaming. Since 2010, U.S. Cellular has offered nationwide 3G data roaming services, allowing its customers to access high-speed data across the country. 

U.S. Cellular has entered into 4G LTE roaming agreement s with national wireless companies . The FCC&#8217;s adoption of mandatory 4G LTE roaming rules, which were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, may be of assistance in the negotiation of 4G LTE roaming agreements with other wireless operators in the future. However, technological challenges currently exist which can limit the interoperability of 4G LTE wireless devices on other carriers&#8217; networks. Specifically, wireless devices support certain configurations of spectrum frequencies and as a result 4G LTE wireless devices offered by carriers are not necessarily compatible with the networks of other carriers. U.S. Cellular is working with other carriers, original equipment manufacturers and potential LTE roaming vendors to mitigate interoperability issues. &#160; 

Access Technology and System Design 

Technology. &#160; Wireless telecommunication systems transmit voice, data, graphics and video through the transmission of signals over networks of radio towers using radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. &#160; Access to local, regional, national and worldwide telecommunications networks is provided through system interconnections. &#160; A high-quality network, supported by continued investments in that network, will remain an important factor for wireless companies to remain competitive. 

U.S. Cellular has deployed 4G LTE technology in conjunction with King Street Wireless L.P. that covered approximately 99% of its postpaid customers as of December 31, 2015 . 4G LTE technology enables more network capacity for more data per user as well as faster access to data. In 2015, U.S. Cellular began user trials of its VoLTE servic e in selected operating markets. &#160; VoLTE will allow U.S. Cellular&#8217;s customers and customers of other wireless carriers that have roaming agreements with U.S. Cellular to utilize U.S. Cellular&#8217;s LTE network for voice and data services. &#160; U.S. Cellular continues to offer services based on 3G technology and CDMA digital technology across its networks. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Through roaming agreements with other CDMA-based wireless carriers, U.S. Cellular&#8217;s customers may access CDMA service in virtually all areas of the United States, as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. &#160; Another digital technology, Global System for Mobile Communication (&#8220;GSM&#8221;), has a larger installed base of customers worldwide. U.S. Cellular customers now have the ability to roam on GSM carriers with voice, data and SMS in Canada, Mexico and internationally. &#160; Both CDMA and GSM technologies are being succeeded by 4G LTE technology. &#160; U.S . Cellular customers can also experience nationwide 4G LTE covera ge as a result of roaming agreement s with national carrier s. 

System Design and Construction. &#160; &#160; U.S. &#160; Cellular designs and constructs its systems in a manner it believes will permit it to provide high-quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices. &#160; Designs are based on engineering studies which relate to specific markets, in support of the larger network. &#160; Network reliability is given careful consideration and extensive backup redundancy is employed in many aspects of U.S. Cellular&#8217;s network design. &#160; Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topology and extensive use of emergency standby power also are used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruption from any particular network element failure. 

In accordance with its strategy of building and strengthening its operating market areas, U.S. Cellular has selected high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single mobile telephone switching office. &#160; Centralized equipment, used for network and data management, is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy. U.S. Cellular&#8217;s systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network. Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet technology for nearly all 4G LTE sites, over fiber or microwave links. 

U.S. Cellular believes that currently available technologies and appropriate capital additions will allow sufficient capacity on its networks to meet anticipated demand for voice and data services over the next few years. However, increasing demand for high-speed data may require the acquisition of additional spectrum licenses to provide sufficient capacity and throughput. 

Construction of wireless systems is capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment for land and improvements, buildings, towers, mobile telephone switching offices, cell site equipment, transport equipment, engineering and installation. &#160; U.S. Cellular primarily uses its own personnel to engineer each wireless system it owns and operates, and engages contractors to construct the facilities. 

The costs (inclusive of the costs to acquire licenses) to develop the systems which U.S. &#160; Cellular operates have historically been financed primarily through proceeds from debt and equity offerings, with cash generated by operations, and proceeds from the sales of wireless interests and other non-strategic assets. 

Business Development Strategy 

U.S. Cellular groups its individual markets (geographic service areas as defined by the FCC in which wireless carriers are licensed, for fixed terms, to provide service) into broader geographic market areas to offer customers large service areas that primarily utilize U.S. Cellular&#8217;s network. &#160; U.S. Cellular&#8217;s ownership interests in wireless licenses include both consolidated and investment interest s in operating and non-operating licenses covering portions of 31 states and a total population of 50.5 million at December 31, 2015 . 

U.S. Cellular&#8217;s business development strategy is to obtain interests in and access to wireless licenses in its current operating markets and in areas that are adjacent to or in close proximity to its other wireless licenses, thereby building contiguous operating market areas. &#160; U.S. Cellular believes that the acquisition of additional licenses within its current operating markets will enhance its network capacity to meet its customers&#8217; increased demand for data services. &#160; U.S. Cellular may continue to make opportunistic acquisitions or exchanges that further strengthen its current operating markets or other attractive markets. &#160; From time to time, U.S. Cellular has divested outright or included in exchanges for other wireless interests certain consolidated and investment interests that were considered less essential to its current and expected future operations. &#160; As part of its business development strategy, U.S. Cellular from time to time may be engaged in negotiations relating to the acquisition, exchange or disposition of companies, strategic properties or wireless spectrum. &#160; See Note 6 &#8212; Acquisitions, Divestitures and Exchanges and Note 8 &#8212; Investments in Unconsolidated Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of significant acquisitions, divestitures and exchanges in the years 2013 through 2015 . &#160; 

From time to time, the FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services. &#160; U.S. Cellular may participate as a bidder, or member of a bidding group, in future auctions. In February 2016, U.S. Cellular filed an application to participate as a forward auction bidder for 600MHz broadcast television spectrum licenses in an FCC auction referred to as Auction 1000. Auction 1000 is expected to commence with the broadcaster initial commitment deadline on March 29, 2016. Forward auction bidding is likely to begin a couple of months later and could continue for three months or longer. Due to the FCC&#8217;s anti-collusion rules, U.S. Cellular may not disclose any details relating to its participation or information about whether or not it is a winning bidder unless and until it is announced as a winning bidder by the FCC. See Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, under &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; FCC Auction 1000.&#8221; 

U.S. Cellular has participated in certain prior FCC auctions indirectly through its limited partnership interests. &#160; Each entity that qualified as a &#8220;designated entity&#8221; was eligible for bidding credits with respect to most licenses purchased in accordance with the rules defined by the FCC for each auction. &#160; In most cases, the bidding credits resulted in a 25% discount from the gross winning bid. 

In January 2015, the FCC released the results of Auction 97. &#160; U.S. Cellular participated in Auction 97 indirectly through its limited partnership interest in Advantage Spec trum L.P. &#160; Advantage Spectrum L.P. applied as a &#8220;designated entity&#8221; and expects to receive bid credits resulting in a 25% discount with respect to spectrum purchased in Auction 97. See Note 13 &#8212; Variable Interest Entities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Due to changes in FCC rules, U.S. Cellular will not be participating in Auction 1000 through a limited partnership that is a &#8220;designated entity&#8221; which qualifies for a discount of 25% on any licenses won in the auction . Instead, U.S. Cellular will be participating in the auction directly and will not qua lify for any discount on licenses that may be won in the auction. 

In 2012, the FCC conducted a single round, sealed bid, reverse auction to award Mobility Fund Phase I support to bidders that commit to provide wireless service in areas designated as unserved by the FCC. &#160; U.S. Cellular and several of its subsidiaries were winning bidders in eligible areas within 10 states. See &#160; Note 17 &#160; &#8212; &#160; Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Regulation 

U.S. Cellular&#8217;s operations are subject to federal, state and local regulation. Key regulatory considerations are discussed below. &#160; Additional information relating to U.S. Cellular&#8217;s regulatory environment is in Risk Factors and incorporated by reference from Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, Annual Report section &#8220;Regulatory Matters . &#8221; 

U.S. Cellular provides various wireless services, including voice and data services, pursuant to licenses granted by the FCC. &#160; The construction, operation and transfer of wireless systems in the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (&#8220;Communications Act&#8221;). &#160; The FCC currently does not require wireless carriers to comply with a number of statutory provisions otherwise applicable to common carriers that provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications. &#160; However, the FCC has enacted regulations governing construction and operation of wireless systems, licensing (including renewal of licenses) and technical standards for the provision of wireless services under the Communications Act. 

Wireless licenses are granted by the FCC based on various geographic areas. &#160; The completion of acquisitions, involving the transfer of control of all or a portion of a wireless system requires prior FCC approval. &#160; The FCC determines on a case-by-case basis whether an acquisition of wireless licenses is in the public interest. &#160; Wireless licenses are generally granted for a ten year term or, in some cases, for a fifteen year term. &#160; The FCC has established standards for conducting comparative renewal proceedings between a wireless license holder seeking renewal of its license and challengers filing competing applications. &#160; All of U.S. Cellular&#8217;s licenses for which it applied for renewal between 1995 and 201 5 have been renewed. &#160; The FCC is pursuing proceedings to modify the license renewal process. &#160; U.S. Cellular expects to meet the criteria of any license renewal process. 

As part of its data services, U.S. Cellular provides internet access. &#160; As described more fully in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K under &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; FCC Net Neutrality Order,&#8221; there are developments and proposals that may result in greater regulation of wireless data services relating to internet access.
