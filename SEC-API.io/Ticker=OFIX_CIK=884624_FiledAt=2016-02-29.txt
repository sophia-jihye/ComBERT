BioStim 

Spinal Regenerative Solutions 

Regenerative stimulators used in spinal applications are designed to enhance bone growth and the success rate of certain spinal fusions by stimulating the body&#8217;s own natural healing mechanism post-surgically. These non-invasive portable devices are intended to be used as part of a home treatment program prescribed by a physician. 

&#160;

We offer two spinal regenerative stimulation devices, Spinal-Stim &#174; and Cervical-Stim &#174; , through our subsidiary, Orthofix Inc. Our stimulation products use a PEMF technology designe d to enhance the growth of bone tissue following surgery and are placed externally over the site to be healed. Research data shows that our PEMF signal induces mineralization and results in a process that stimulates new regeneration at the spinal fusion si te. We have sponsored independent research at Cleveland Clinic, New York University and University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, where scientists conducted animal and cellular studies to identify the mechanisms of action of our PEMF signals on b one and efficacy of healing. From this effort, a total of six studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Among other insights, the studies illustrate positive effects of PEMF on callus formation and bone strength as well as proliferation and di fferentiation of cells involved in regeneration and healing. Furthermore, we believe that the research work with Cleveland Clinic allowing for characterization and visualization of the Orthofix PEMF waveform is paving the way for signal optimization for a variety of new applications and indications. This collection of pre-clinical data along with additional clinical data could represent new clinical indication opportunities for our regenerative stimulation solutions. 

Some spine fusion patients are at greater risk of not achieving a solid fusion of new bone around the fusion site. These patients typically have one or more risk factors such as smoking, obesity or diabetes, or their surgery involves the revision of a failed fusion or the fusion of multiple levels of vertebrae in one procedure. For these patients, post-surgical regenerative stimulation has been shown to significantly increase the probability of fusion success. Spinal-Stim &#174; is a non-invasive spinal fusion stimulator system commercially available in the U.S. since 1990 and approved in Europe. Spinal-Stim &#174; is designed for the treatment of the lower thoracic and lumbar regions of the spine. The device uses proprietary technology and a wavelength to generate a PEMF signal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) has approved Spinal-Stim &#174; as a spinal fusion adjunct to increase the probability of fusion success and as a non-operative treatment for salvage of failed spinal fusion at least nine months post-operatively. 

Our Cervical-Stim &#174; stimulator product remains the only FDA-approved bone growth stimulator on the market indicated for use as an adjunct to cervical (upper) spine fusion surgery in patients at high-risk for non-fusion. The FDA approved this device in 2004, and it has been commercially available in the U.S. since 2005. 

Orthopedic Regenerative Solutions 

Our Physio-Stim &#174; regenerative stimulator products use PEMF technology similar to that described previously in the discussion of our spine stimulators. The primary difference is that the Physio-Stim &#174; physical configuration is designed for use on long bones. 

A bone&#8217;s regenerative power results in most fractures healing naturally within a few months. In certain situations, however, fractures do not heal or heal slowly, resulting in &#8220;non-unions.&#8221; Traditionally, orthopedists have treated such fracture conditions surgically, often by means of a bone graft with fracture fixation devices, such as bone plates, screws or intramedullary rods. These are examples of &#8220;invasive&#8221; treatments. Our patented regenerative stimulators are designed to use a low level of PEMF signals to activate the body&#8217;s natural healing process. 

Our systems offer portability, rechargeable battery operation, integrated component design, patient monitoring capabilities and the ability to cover a large treatment area without factory calibration for specific patient application. 

Biologics 

The regenerative solutions offered as part of our biologics&#8217; portfolio include solutions for a variety of musculoskeletal defects used in spinal and extremity orthopedic procedures. 

Regenerative Solutions 

Our premier biologics tissues include Trinity ELITE &#174; and Trinity Evolution &#174; , which are cortical cancellous allografts that contain viable cells and are used during surgery in the treatment of musculoskeletal defects for bone reconstruction and repair. These allografts are intended to offer a viable alternative to an autograft procedure; harvesting autograft adds risk of an additional surgical procedure and related patient discomfort in conjunction with a repair surgery. 

To offer structural support and facilitate bone growth in spine fusion procedures we offer a full line of Alloquent &#174; allograft structural spacers derived from human cadaveric bone. These spacers are used to restore the height lost between vertebral bodies when discs are removed in fusion procedures and to facilitate spine fusion. 

We market Collage &#174; as an osteoconductive scaffold and a bone graft substitute product. The product is a combination synthetic bone graft substitute comprised of beta tri-calcium phosphate and type 1 bovine collagen. 

&#160;

We market VersaShield &#174; , a thin hydrophilic amniotic membrane designed to serve as a wound or tissue cover ing for a variety of surgical demands. Amniotic tissue forms derived from donated human placenta are used in a wide variety of applications and are valued for their healing properties, scar reduction and anti-adhesion characteristics. VersaShield &#174; is deriv ed from the human placental layers amnion and chorion; these thin elastic membranes allow the tissue to conform to the surface of the surgical site. 

We receive a marketing fee through our collaboration with MTF for Trinity Evolution &#174; , Trinity ELITE &#174; , and VersaShield &#174; . Under our Agreements with MTF, MTF processes the tissues, maintains inventory, and invoices hospitals and surgery centers and other points of care for service fees, which are submitted by customers via purchase orders. We have exclusive worldwide rights to market our Trinity Evolution &#174; and Trinity ELITE &#174; technologies. We market our VersaShield &#174; under a private label brand via a non-exclusive marketing agreement for the tissue form. 

To date, our Biologics are offered primarily in the U.S. market due in part to restrictions in providing U.S. human donor tissue in other countries. 

Extremity Fixation 

The medical devices offered in our Extremity Fixation SBU include both internal and external fixation solutions for extremity repair and deformity correction, both for adults and children. 

Extremity Repair Solutions 

Our fracture repair products consist of fixation devices designed to stabilize a broken bone until it can heal. Our fracture repair products come in two main types: external devices and internal devices. With these devices, we can treat simple and complex fracture patterns along with achieving deformity corrections. 

External Fixation 

External fixation devices are used to stabilize fractures from outside the skin with minimal invasion into the body. These fixation devices use screws that are inserted into the bone on either side of the fracture site, to which the fixator body is attached externally. The bone segments are aligned by manipulating the external device using patented ball joints and, when aligned, are locked in place for stabilization. External fixation may also be used as temporary devices in complex trauma cases to stabilize the fracture prior to treating it definitively. We believe that external fixation is among the most minimally invasive surgical options for fracture management. Also, we believe external fixation is the ideal treatment option for highly complex fractures, patients who have fractures close to the joints, or patients with known risk factors or co-morbidities. 

The LRS Advanced Limb Reconstruction System &#174; uses callus distraction to lengthen bone in a variety of procedures. It can be used in monofocal lengthening and corrections of deformity. Its multifocal procedures include bone transport, simultaneous compression and distraction at different sites, bifocal lengthening and correction of deformities with shortening. In 2009, improvements on size, flexibility and ease of use were implemented for the release of the LRS Advanced Limb Reconstruction System &#174; . 

Our external fixation product, Galaxy Fixation &#174; , which was released in 2012, incorporates a streamlined combination of clamps with both pin-to-bar and bar-to-bar coupling capabilities that provide a complete range of applications and reduces inventory. It also includes specific units for the elbow, shoulder and wrist. While the rigidity and stability allows for use in definitive fixation, the design also addresses the need for rapid stabilization needed for temporary fixation in large trauma centers. 

The TrueLok&#8482; Ring Fixation System is a surgeon-designed, lightweight external fixation system for limb lengthening and deformity correction. In essence, a ring fixation construct consists of circular rings and semi-circular external supports centered on the patient&#8217;s limb and secured to the bone by crossed, tensioned wires and half pins. The rings are connected externally to provide stable bone fixation. The main external connecting elements are threaded rods, linear distractors, or hinges and angular distractors, which allow the surgeon to adjust the relative position of rings to each other. The ring positions are manipulated either acutely or gradually in precise increments to perform the correction of the deformity, limb lengthening, or bone segment transportation as required by the surgeon. Created with pre-assembled function blocks, the TrueLok&#8482; is a simple, stable, versatile ring fixation system. 

Building on the TrueLok&#8482; brand, in the international markets, TL-HEX&#8482; TrueLok Hexapod System &#174; was released in 2012. TL-HEX&#8482; is a hexapod-based system designed at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children as a three-dimensional bone segment reposition module to augment the previously developed TrueLok&#8482; frame. In essence, the system consists of circular and semi-circular external supports secured to the bones by wires and half pins and interconnected by six struts. This allows multi-planar adjustment of the external supports. The rings&#8217; position is adjusted either rapidly or gradually in precise increments to perform bone segment 

&#160;

repositioning in three-dimensional space. All the basic components from the TrueLok Ring Fixation System (wire and half pin fixation bolts, posts, threaded rods, plates as well as other assembly components and instrumentation) can be utili zed with TL-HEX&#8482;; therefore external supports from both systems can be connected to each other when building fixation blocks. As with any other hexapod-type external fixator, for successful application of the TL-HEX&#8482;, an associated software is also availab le ( www.tlhex.com ). 

Another one of our external fixation devices is the XCaliber &#174; fixator, which is made from a lightweight radiolucent material and provided in three configurations to cover long bone fractures, fractures near joints and ankle fractures. The radiolucency of XCaliber &#174; fixators allows X-rays to pass through the device and provides the surgeon with improved X-ray visualization of the fracture and alignment. These three configurations cover a broad range of fractures. The XCaliber &#174; fixators are provided pre-assembled in sterile kits to decrease time in the operating room. 

Our proprietary XCaliber &#174; bone screws are designed to be compatible with our external fixators and reduce inventory for our customers. Some of these screws are covered with hydroxyapatite, a mineral component of bone that reduces superficial inflammation of soft tissue and improves bone grip. Other screws in this proprietary line do not include the hydroxyapatite coating, but offer different advantages such as patented thread designs for better adherence in hard or poor quality bone. We believe we have a full line of bone screws to meet the demands of the market. Adding to the XCaliber &#174; bone screw product line are also cylindrical screws first released for the US market and which we expect will be following in international markets. The type of screw is geared towards the trauma applications of the Galaxy Fixation &#174; System. 

Internal Fixation 

Internal fixation devices come in various sizes, depending on the bone that requires treatment, and consist of either long rods, commonly referred to as nails, or plates that are attached with the use of screws. A nail is inserted into the medullary canal of a fractured long bone of the human arms and legs, e.g., humerus, femur and tibia. Alternatively, a plate is attached by screws to an area such as a broken wrist, hip or foot. Examples of our internal fixation devices include: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Centronail &#174; Titanium Nailing System is designed to stabilize fractures in the femur, tibia, supracondylar and humerus. Its main advantages are, it is made of titanium, offers improved mechanical distal targeting and instrumentation and has a design that requires significantly less inventory. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Ankle Hindfoot Nail from Orthofix is an arthrodesis nailing system designed to improve upon the stability, simplicity, and flexibility of current hindfoot nails. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The VeroNail &#174; marks Orthofix&#8217;s entry into the intramedullary hip nailing market. Designed for use in hip fractures, it provides a minimally-invasive screw and nail design intended to reduce surgical trauma and allow patients to begin walking again shortly after the operation. It uses a dual screw configuration that we believe provides more stability than previous single screw designs. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The Contours LPS&#8482; (Lapidus Plating System) sold in the U.S. is intended for the correction of moderate to severe forefoot hallus valgus (HV), accompanying bunions and associated instability. The Lapidus Plating System consists of plates, screws and instrumentation. The anatomical plates are low-profile, titanium, (left and right) designed specifically for 1st metatarsocuneiform joint arthrodesis allowing compression across the joint achieved through a delta-shaped hole and compression screws. Lapidus System screws are titanium, low-profile and self-tapping, and include locking, non-locking, and bone compression screws in a variety of lengths. 

In addition to the treatment of bone fractures, we also design, manufacture and distribute devices intended to treat congenital bone conditions, such as angular deformities (e.g., bowed legs in children), or degenerative diseases, as well as conditions resulting from a previous trauma. An example of a product offered in this area is the Eight-Plate Guided Growth System &#174; . 

Spine Fixation 

Neck and back pain is a common health problem for many people throughout the world and often requires surgical or non-surgical intervention for improvement. Neck and back problems are usually of a degenerative or neurological nature and are generally more prevalent among the older population. As the population ages, we believe physicians will see an increasing number of patients with degenerative spine issues who wish to have a better quality of life than that experienced by previous generations. Treatment options for spine disorders are expected to expand to fill the existing gap between conservative pain management and invasive surgical options, such as spine fusion. 

We believe our spine products are positioned to address the needs of spine patients. Our products currently address the cervical fusion segment as well as the lumbar fusion segment, which is the largest sub-segment of the spine market. 

&#160;

We offer a wide array of spinal repair products used during surgical procedures intended to treat a vari ety of spine conditions. Many of these surgeries are fusion procedures in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine that utilize metal plates, rods and screws, interbody spacers, Human Cell, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, or HCT/P, as well a s vertebral body replacement devices to promote bone growth. 

Spinal Repair Solutions 

The human spine is made up of 33 interlocking vertebrae that protect the spinal cord and provide structural support for the body. The top seven vertebrae make up the cervical spine, which bears the weight of the skull and provides the largest range of motion. The next 17 mobile vertebrae encompass the thoracic and lumbar, or thoracolumbar, sections of the spine. The thoracic spine (12 vertebrae) helps to protect the organs of the chest cavity by attaching to the rib cage, and is the least mobile segment of the spine. The lumbar spine (five vertebrae) carries the greatest portion of the body&#8217;s weight, allowing a degree of flexion, extension and rotation thus handling the majority of the bending movement. Additionally, five fused vertebrae make up the sacrum (part of the pelvis) and four vertebrae make up the final part of the spine, the coccyx. 

Spinal bending and rotation are accomplished through the vertebral discs located between each vertebra. Each disc is made up of a tough fibrous exterior, called the annulus, which surrounds a soft core called the nucleus. Excess pressure, deformities, injury or disease can lead to a variety of conditions affecting the vertebrae and discs that may ultimately require medical intervention in order to relieve patient pain and restore stability in the spine. 

Spinal fusion is the permanent union of two or more vertebrae to immobilize and stabilize the affected portion of the spine. Most fusion surgeries involve the placement of a bone graft between the affected vertebrae, which is typically held in place by metal implants that also provide stability to the spine until the desired growth of new bone can complete the fusion process. These implants typically consist of some combination of rods, screws and plates that are designed to remain in the patient even after the fusion has occurred. 

Most fusion procedures performed on the lumbar area of the spine are done from the posterior, or back, while the majority of cervical fusions are performed from the anterior, or front, of the body. However, the growing use of interbody devices specially designed for an anterior approach has resulted in the increasing use this approach for many lumbar surgeries. Interbody devices are small hollow implants typically made of bone, metal or a thermoplastic compound called Polyetheretherketones (&#8220;PEEK&#8221;) that are placed between the affected vertebrae to restore the space lost by the degenerated disc. The hollow spaces within these interbody devices are typically packed with some form of bone grafting material designed to accelerate the formation of new bone around the graft, which ultimately results in the desired fusion. 

We provide a wide array of implants designed for use primarily in cervical, thoracic and lumbar fusion surgeries. These implants are made of either metal or PEEK. The majority of the implants that we offer are made of titanium metal. This includes the 3&#176;&#8482;, Reliant &#174; and Hallmark &#174; cervical plates. Additionally, the Spinal Fixation System (&#8220;SFS&#8221;), the Firebird &#174; Spinal Fixation System, the Phoenix &#174; Minimally Invasive Spinal Fixation System, the Ascent &#174; , Ascent &#174; LE, and the Centurion &#174; POCT Systems are sets of rods, cross connectors and screws which are implanted during posterior fusion procedures. The Firebird &#174; Modular and pre-assembled Spinal Fixation System is designed to be used in either open or minimally-invasive posterior lumbar fusion procedures with our product ProView &#174; MAP System. To complement our plate and screw based fixation options we offer an entire portfolio of cervical and thoracolumbar PEEK interbody devices within our Pillar &#174; and Forza &#174; product lines. This interbody portfolio includes two stand-alone devices, Lonestar &#174; and Pillar SA &#174; , as well as the Construx &#174; Mini PTC&#8482; system, a novel titanium composite spacer which offers a superior alternative to other plasma spray coated options currently available on the market. We also offer specialty plates and screws that are used in less common procedures, and as such, are not manufactured by many device makers. These specialty implants include the Newbridge &#174; Laminoplasty Fixation System that is designed to expand the cervical vertebrae and relieve pressure on the spinal canal, the Samba-Screw &#174; System used in Sacroiliac Joint Fixation, as well as the Unity &#174; plate which is used in anterior lumbar fusion procedures. 

Product Development 

Our research and development departments are responsible for new product development. We work regularly with certain institutions referred to below as well as with physicians and other consultants on the long-term scientific planning and evolution of our research and development efforts. These efforts are performed in accordance with best practices on interactions with healthcare professionals as set forth, for example, in the AdvaMed Code of Ethics (&#8220;AdvaMed Code&#8221;) and the Eucomed Code of Business Practices (&#8220;Eucomed Code&#8221;). Our primary research and development facilities are located in Verona, Italy and Lewisville, Texas. 

We maintain interactive relationships with spine and orthopedic centers in the U.S., Europe, and South and Central America, including research and clinical organizations such as the MTF, the Orthopedic Research and Education Foundation and the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children. Several of the products that we market have been developed through these collaborations. In 

&#160;

addition, we regularly receive suggestions for new products from the scientific and medical community, some of which result in Orthofix entering into assignment or license agreement s with physicians and third parties. We also receive a substantial number of requests for the production of customized items, some of which have resulted in new products. We believe our policy of accommodating such requests enhances our reputation in the m edical community. 

In 2015, 2014 and 2013 we incurred $26.4 million, $25.0 million and $26.8 million, respectively, of research and development expense. 

Patents, Trade Secrets, Assignments and Licenses 

We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, assignment and license agreements as well as non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous pending patent applications and license rights under patents held by third parties. Our primary products are patented in major markets in which they are sold. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or assigned to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that such patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage or protection. Third parties might also obtain patents that would require assignments to or licensing by us for the conduct of our business. We rely on confidentiality agreements with key employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. 

We obtain assignments or licenses of varying durations for certain of our products from third parties. We typically acquire rights under such assignments or licenses in exchange for lump-sum payments or arrangements under which we pay to the licensor a percentage of sales. However, while assignments or licenses to us generally are irrevocable, there is no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be made available to us on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The terms of our license and assignment agreements vary in length from a specified number of years to the life of product patents or the economic life of the product. These agreements generally provide for royalty payments and termination rights in the event of a material breach. 

Corporate Compliance and Government Regulation 

Corporate Compliance and Ethics Program 

We have a comprehensive compliance program, which we branded the Integrity Advantage&#8482; Program, which is overseen by our Chief Compliance Officer throughout our Company. It is a fundamental policy of our Company to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. Our corporate compliance and ethics program is designed to promote legal compliance and ethical business practices throughout our domestic and international businesses. 

Our Integrity Advantage&#8482; Program is designed to meet U.S. Sentencing Commission Guidelines for effective organizational compliance and ethics programs and to prevent and detect violations of applicable federal, state and local laws. Key elements of the Integrity Advantage&#8482; Program include: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Organizational oversight by senior-level personnel responsible for the compliance function within our Company; 

&#160;

&#160;

G overnment Regulation 

Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the U.S. are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our products and facilities vary widely from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country. 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will be covered by either premarket notification (&#8220;510(k)&#8221;) clearance, letter to file, approval of a premarket approval application (&#8220;PMA&#8221;), or some other approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose low risk are placed in class I. Those devices that are considered moderate risk are class II, which typically requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device, a process generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk class I devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in class III, requiring approval of a PMA. 

Manufacturers of most class II medical devices are required to obtain 510(k) clearance prior to marketing their devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to another legally marketed 510(k)-cleared &#8220;predicate device.&#8221; By regulation, the FDA is required to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance may take longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. With certain exceptions, most of our products are subject to the 510(k) clearance process. On January 27, 2010, the FDA requested comments on actions that the FDA&#8217;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (&#8220;CDRH&#8221;) can consider taking to strengthen the 510(k) review process conducted by the CDRH. In August 2010, the FDA published a series of recommended changes to the 510(k) review process. 

Class III medical devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and also information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will typically conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the PMA application, although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, or longer. Once approved, a new PMA or a PMA Supplement is required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device&#8217;s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Our regenerative bone growth stimulation products are classified as Class III by the FDA, and have been approved for commercial distribution in the U.S. through the PMA process. 

In addition, our Biologics business markets tissue for bone repair and reconstruction under the brand names Trinity Evolution &#174; and Trinity ELITE &#174; which are allogeneic bone matrices comprised of cancellous bone containing viable stem cells and a demineralized cortical bone component. We believe these allografts are properly classified under FDA&#8217;s Human Cell, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, or HCT/P, regulatory paradigm and not as a medical device or as a biologic or as a drug. We believe they are regulated under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and C.F.R. Part 1271. Biologics also distributes certain surgical implant products known as &#8220;allograft&#8221; products that are derived from human tissues and which are used for bone reconstruction or repair and are surgically implanted into the human body. We believe that these tissues are properly classified by the FDA as minimally-manipulated tissue and are covered by FDA&#8217;s &#8220;Good Tissues Practices&#8221; regulations, which cover all stages of allograft processing. There can be no assurance our suppliers of the Trinity Evolution &#174; , Trinity ELITE &#174; and allograft products will continue to meet applicable regulatory requirements or that those requirements will not be changed in ways that could adversely affect our business. Further, there can be no assurance these products will continue to be made available to us or that applicable regulatory standards will be met or remain unchanged. Moreover, products derived from human tissue or bones are from time to time subject to recall for certain administrative or safety reasons and we may be affected by one or more such recalls. For a description of these risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors. 

The medical devices we develop, manufacture, distribute and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no 

&#160;

assurance such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe we have obtained all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our products and that they are in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory r equirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements include: product listing and establishment re gistration; Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;), which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing proc ess; labeling regulations and governmental prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses or indications; clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would consti tute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our PMA approved devices; Medical Device Adverse Event Reporting regulations, which require that manufact urers report to FDA and other foreign governmental agencies if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDA&#8217;s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaini ng to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals. 

We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and European Notified Bodies to determine our compliance with FDA&#8217;s QSR and other international regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. In addition to the domestic FDA inspections, all manufacturing facilities of the Company are subject to annual Notified Body inspections. No major findings have been received and certification has been granted or maintained. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Any of those actions could have a material adverse effect on our development of new laboratory tests, business strategy, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of these risks, see Item 1A Risk Factors.

Moreover, governmental authorities outside the U.S. have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;) has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical Device Directives with which manufacturers must comply. Under these new regulations, manufacturing plants must have received a full Quality Assurance Certification from a &#8220;Notified Body&#8221; in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the European Union. This Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a &#8220;CE&#8221; mark. Products covered by the EC regulations that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the European Union. We have received certification for all currently existing manufacturing facilities. 

Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policyholder&#8217;s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services. The Medicare program is expected to continue to implement a new payment mechanism for certain items of durable medical equipment, prosthetic, orthotic supplies (&#8220;DMEPOS&#8221;) via the implementation of its competitive bidding program. The initial implementation was terminated shortly after it began in 2008 and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) began the rebid process in 2009 (&#8220;Round 1 Rebid&#8221;) with implementation of the rebid round occurring on January 1, 2011. Payment rates for certain DMEPOS items included in the Round 1 Rebid product categories, which categories do not currently include our products, will be determined based on bid prices rather than the current Medicare DMEPOS fee schedule. CMS has released the geographical areas included in Round 2 of the program, yet final decisions concerning which products will be affected have not been announced. The Company&#8217;s bone growth stimulation products are exempt from this competitive bidding process. 

Our subsidiary Orthofix Inc. received accreditation status by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care, Inc. (&#8220;ACHC&#8221;) for the services of DMEPOS. ACHC, a private, not-for-profit corporation, which is certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards, was developed by home care and community-based providers to help companies improve business operations and quality of patient care. Although accreditation is generally a voluntary activity where healthcare organizations submit to peer review their internal policies, processes and patient care delivery against national standards, CMS required DMEPOS suppliers to become accredited. By attaining 

&#160;

accreditation, Orthof ix Inc. has demonstrated its commitment to maintain a higher level of competency and strive for excellence in its products, services, and customer satisfaction. 

Our sales and marketing practices are also subject to a number of U.S. laws regulating healthcare fraud and abuse such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal Physician Self-Referral Law (known as the &#8220;Stark Law&#8221;), the Civil False Claims Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) as well as numerous state laws regulating healthcare and insurance. These laws are enforced by the Office of Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and other federal, state and local agencies. Among other things, these laws and others generally: (1) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (2) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; (3) prohibit the transmission of protected healthcare information to persons not authorized to receive that information; and (4) require the maintenance of certain government licenses and permits. 

In addition, U.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain health information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records and restrict the use and disclosure of that protected information. At the federal level, the Department of Health and Human Services promulgates health information privacy and security rules under HIPAA. These rules protect health information by regulating its use and disclosure, including for research and other purposes. Failure of a HIPAA &#8220;covered entity&#8221; to comply with HIPAA regarding such &#8220;protected health information&#8221; could constitute a violation of federal law, subject to civil and criminal penalties. Covered entities include healthcare providers (including those that sell devices or equipment) that engage in particular electronic transactions, including, as we do, the transmission of claims to health plans. Consequently, health information that we access, collect, analyze, and otherwise use and/or disclose includes protected health information that is subject to HIPAA. As noted above, many state laws also pertain to the confidentiality of health information. Such laws are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA in particular those state laws that afford greater privacy protection to the individual than HIPAA. These state laws typically have their own penalty provisions, which could be applied in the event of an unlawful action affecting health information. 

On February 1, 2013, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) published a final rule that makes information publicly available about payments or other transfers of value from certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (&#8220;CHIP&#8221;), defined as applicable manufacturers, to physicians and teaching hospitals, which are defined as covered recipients. Called the &#8220;National Physician Payment Transparency Program: Open Payments,&#8221; this is one of many steps in the Affordable Care Act designed to create greater transparency in health care markets. 

The final rule, which implements Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act, also makes information publicly available about physician (or immediate family members of a physician) ownership or investment interests in applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations (&#8220;GPOs&#8221;). 

The law specifies that applicable manufacturers must report annually to the Secretary of Health and Human Services all payments or transfers of value (including gifts, consulting fees, research activities, speaking fees, meals, and travel) from applicable manufacturers to covered recipients. In addition to reporting on payments, applicable manufacturers, as well as applicable GPOs, must report ownership and investment interests held by physicians (or the immediate family members of physicians) in such entities. However, the law does not require applicable manufacturers or applicable GPOs to report ownership or investment interests held by teaching hospitals. The law requires CMS to provide applicable manufacturers, applicable GPOs, covered recipients, and physician owners and investors at least 45 days to review, dispute and correct their reported information before posting it on a publicly available website. The information on the website must be easily aggregated, downloaded and searchable. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

General Trends 

We believe that demographic trends, principally in the form of a better informed, more active and aging population in the major healthcare markets of the U.S., Western Europe and Japan, together with opportunities in emerging markets such as the Asia-Pacific Region (including China) and Latin America, as well as our focus on innovative products, will continue to have a positive effect on the demand for our products. 

Strategic Business Units 

Our revenues are generally derived from the sales of products in four SBUs, BioStim, Biologics, Extremity Fixation, and Spine Fixation, which accounted for 42%, 15%, 24%, and 19%, respectively, of our total net sales in 2015. 

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Distributor Network 

We have established a broad distribution network comprised of direct sales representatives and distributors. This established distribution network provides us with a platform to introduce new products and expand sales of existing products. We distribute our products worldwide in over 65 countries. 

In our largest market, the U.S., our sales, marketing and distribution network is comprised of several sales forces addressing different business units. A hybrid distribution network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors addresses the BioStim SBU for regenerative stimulation products. Primarily an independent distribution network supplemented by some direct sales representatives addresses the Biologics SBU. A hybrid distribution network of both direct sales representatives and distributors addresses the Extremity Fixation SBU. Primarily an independent distribution network addresses the Spine Fixation SBU. 

Outside the U.S., we employ both direct sales representatives and distributors within our international sales subsidiaries. We also utilize independent distributors in Europe, the Far East, the Middle East and Central and South America in countries where we do not have subsidiaries. In order to provide support to our independent distribution network, we have a group of sales and marketing specialists who regularly visit independent distributors to provide training and product support. 

Marketing and Product Education 

We seek to market our products principally to medical professionals, hospitals, government health agencies and organizations that contract on a large scale. 

We support our sales force through specialized training workshops in which surgeons and sales specialists participate. We also produce marketing and training materials, including materials outlining surgical procedures, for our customers, sales force and distributors in a variety of languages using printed, video and multimedia formats. 

To provide additional advanced training for surgeons, consistent with the AdvaMed Code and the Eucomed Code guidelines, we organize regular multilingual teaching seminars in multiple locations. Those places include our facility in Verona, Italy, various locations in Latin America and the Orthofix Institute for Research, Training and Education in the North American Operations and Training Center in Lewisville, Texas. The Orthofix Institute is a state of the art facility that features a lecture room, classroom, workshop and a 7-station bioskills laboratory. In 2015, over 1,600 surgeons from around the world attended these product education seminars, which included a variety of lectures from specialists as well as demonstrations and hands-on workshops. Each year many of our sales representatives and distributors independently conduct basic product training and education courses to local surgeons. We also regularly provide sales training at our training center in Lewisville, Texas, with our sales representatives in the field and in regional locations throughout the world. Additionally, we have implemented a web-based sales training program, which provides ongoing education for our sales representatives. 

Competition 

Our regenerative stimulation products, which are part of our Biologics and BioStim SBUs, compete principally with similar products marketed by Biomet Spine, a business unit of Zimmer Biomet, Inc; DJO Incorporated; and the Exogen product line owned by Smith and Nephew plc. and Essex Woodlands, a private equity firm. Our spinal implant, HCT/P products, and Trinity Evolution &#174; and Trinity ELITE &#174; , HCT/Ps from which we derive marketing fees, compete with products marketed by Medtronic, Inc.; DePuy Synthes, a division of Johnson and Johnson; Stryker Corp.; Zimmer Biomet, Inc.; NuVasive, Inc.; Globus Medical Inc.; and various smaller public and private companies. For external and internal fixation devices, our principal competitors include DePuy Synthes; Zimmer Biomet, Inc.; Stryker Corp.; and Smith &#38; Nephew plc. 

We believe we enhance our competitive position by focusing on product features such as innovation, ease of use, versatility, cost and patient acceptability. We attempt to avoid competing based solely on price. Overall cost and medical effectiveness, innovation, reliability, after-sales service and training are the most prevalent methods of competition in the markets for our products, and we believe we compete effectively. 

Manufacturing and Sources of Supply 

We generally design, develop, assemble, test and package our stimulation and orthopedic products, and subcontract the manufacture of a substantial portion of the component parts. We design and develop our spinal implant and Alloquent &#174; Allograft HCT/Ps and subcontract the manufacture of a significant portion of the parts and instruments. Through subcontracting a portion of our manufacturing, we attempt to maintain operating flexibility in meeting demand while focusing our resources on product development, education and marketing as well as quality assurance standards. Although certain of our key raw materials are obtained from a single 

&#160;

source, we believe alternate sources for these mate rials are available. Further, we believe an adequate inventory supply is maintained to avoid product flow interruptions. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining the materials necessary to meet our production schedules. 

Trinity Evolution &#174; and Trinity ELITE &#174; , HCT/Ps for which we have exclusive marketing rights, are allograft tissue forms that are supplied to customers by MTF in accordance with orders received directly from us. MTF sources, processes and packages the tissue forms and is the sole supplier of Trinity Evolution &#174; and Trinity ELITE &#174; to our customers. 

Our products are currently manufactured and assembled in the U.S., Italy, and the U.K. We believe our plants comply in all material respects with the requirements of the FDA and all relevant regulatory authorities outside the U.S. For a description of the laws to which we are subject, see Item 1&#8212;Business&#8212;Corporate Compliance and Government Regulation. We actively monitor each of our subcontractors in order to maintain manufacturing and quality standards and product specification conformity. 

Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by seasonality trends as revenue associated with elective procedures tends to be higher later in the year and lower in the beginning of the year. In addition, we do not consider the backlog of firm orders to be material. 

Capital Expenditures 

We incurred tangible and intangible capital expenditures of $27.9 million, $18.5 million and $29.7 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, principally for computer software and hardware, patents, licenses, plant and equipment, tooling and molds and product instrument sets. In 2015 and 2014, the most significant capital expenditure was $16.0 million related to project Bluecore, our infrastructure initiative to improve the reliability and efficiency of our systems, processes and reporting as well as drive down our overhead expenses, and tooling. We plan to invest approximately $15 to $18 million in capital expenditures during 2016 to support this initiative, which will continue through the end of 2016. See Part II, Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for additional information on Bluecore. We expect these capital expenditures to be financed principally with cash generated from operations. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had 927 employees worldwide. Of these, 616 were employed in the U.S. and 311 were employed at other non-U.S. locations. Our relations with our Italian employees, who numbered 170 at December 31, 2015, are governed by the provisions of a National Collective Labor Agreement setting forth mandatory minimum standards for labor relations in the metal mechanic workers industry. We are not a party to any other collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have good relations with our employees. Of our 927 employees, 403 were employed in sales and marketing functions, 214 in general and administrative roles, 204 in production and operations and 106 in research and development. 

eNeura Debt Security 

On March 4, 2015, the Company entered into an Option Agreement (the &#8220;Option Agreement&#8221;) with eNeura, Inc. (&#8220;eNeura&#8221;), a privately held medical technology company that is developing devices for the treatment of migraines. The Option Agreement provides the Company with an exclusive option to acquire eNeura (the &#8220;Option&#8221;) during the 18-month period following the grant of the Option. In consideration for the Option, (i) the Company paid a non-refundable $0.3 million fee to eNeura, and (ii) eNeura issued a Convertible Promissory Note (the &#8220;eNeura Note&#8221;) to the Company. The principal amount of the eNeura Note is $15.0 million and interest accrues at 8.0%. The eNeura Note will mature on the earlier of (i) March 4, 2019, or (ii) exercise of the Option. The interest is not due until the note matures and will be forgiven if the Company exercises the option. The investment is recorded in other long-term assets as an available for sale debt security and interest is recorded in interest income. For additional discussion see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
