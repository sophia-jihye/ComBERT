Our research and devel opment strategy is focused on delivering innovative, sustainable solutions that enhance our customers&#8217; operational efficiency and improve profitability. 

Highly Integrated with our Customer Base. We install our equipment in our customers&#8217; facilities and are integrated into their operational processes. We leverage our extensive installed equipment base when innovating new formulations and solutions and partner with customers to train their employees on how to effectively apply our solutions and operate our systems. We believe this provides customer &#8220;stickiness&#8221; and recurring revenue streams for our Company .

Solid Cash Flow Generation. The stability of our business, combined with the relatively low capital intensity of our operations and our solid working capital management, supports our ability to generate cash flow. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from attractive long-term global growth trends such as an increasing emphasis on food safety and security, health and hygiene, and sustainability, cost competitiveness and performance, as well as our own geographic diversity, to drive additional cash flow. 

Our Business Strategies 

We seek to enhance our position as a leading global provider of innovative packaging and hygiene solutions that our customers use to improve performance, cost competitiveness and sustainability within their operations by focusing on six strategic priorities: 

Maintaining and extending our technological leadership, expertise and our sustainability value proposition. 

We continue to focus on becoming a knowledge-based, market-driven company centered on offering innovative solutions that enable our customers to meet their sustainability needs while growing their business, reducing costs and mitigating risk, including enhancing top line growth and conserving energy, water and other resources while reducing waste in their operations. Our product solution goals align with sustainable sourcing principles and new product development innovation processes, while providing greater transparency of our supply chain. We enhance our ability to position our product features and benefits using a sustainability lens and leverage these product strengths to differentiate our solutions in the market, with a view to this approach becoming the new business standard in the future. 

Better aligning ourselves with the customers, markets and global mega-trends. 

As part of our ongoing business portfolio review, we are committed to identifying those customers and markets that offer us the best opportunity to deliver solutions and services that are sufficiently differentiated and valued in the marketplace. In addition, we are committed to aligning our business with key global mega-trends, including e-commerce, infection control and the global movement of food. In particular, we will leverage our strengths to enhance our position with our food and beverage customers and, by doing so, we improve access to a more secure food supply chain. Our priorities are embodied in our four commitments: enhancing food security, creating healthy and clean environments, conserving natural resources, and driving livelihood programs in the communities where we do business. 

Accelerating our penetration and rate of growth in developing regions. 

With an international focus and extensive geographic footprint aligned to our growth opportunities, we will combine our local market knowledge with our broad portfolio and strengths in innovation and customer service to grow in developing regions. Urbanization, global trade, increased protein consumption and the ongoing conversion to safer and hygienically packaged foods and goods are key secular trends that underpin our confidence in our ability to grow rapidly in these parts of the world. 

Focusing on cash flow generation and improved return on assets. 

We are focused on generating substantial operating cash flow from our existing business so that we can continue to invest in new products and technologies, deleverage our balance sheet, continue to pay dividends, and support growth in our share price. We believe our ongoing process of critically analyzing our business portfolio and reallocating technical, human, and capital resources to the most promising market sectors from those sectors that are less strategic or have a lower level of financial performance will enhance our free cash flow generation performance and result in a higher return on assets, thus improving shareholder value. 

Optimizing our cost base and operations to maximize efficiency and profitability. 

The size and scale of our global operations affords us a continuing opportunity to derive greater supply chain efficiencies by leveraging our purchasing power, optimizing our manufacturing and logistics footprint, improving our internal operations and processes, and reducing complexity and cost. In addition to reducing the cost of our supply chain operations, we continue to focus on adapting the cost structure of our customer facing and back-office operations to the appropriate level required to adequately support our external customer base and run the business effectively. We also have sustainability goals to reduce the environmental impact of our global operations and deliver operational excellence while upholding the highest ethical standards in our business practices. Every year our facilities around the world develop improvement plans to meet environmental impact and cost-reduction goals. These align with corporate goals for energy, greenhouse gases, water, waste, efficiency targets and cost savings. In turn, the company&#8217;s impact on the environment is reduced while the ability to generate profits is enhanced. 

Developing our people. 

We recognize that a core strength of our business is our people. Therefore, we will continue to invest in the development of key skills in our diverse workforce while improving our ability to attract and retain new employees who are motivated by our company vision and the positive impact they can have on the world.

In maintaining our foreign operations, we face risks inherent in these operations, such as currency fluctuations, inflation and political instability. Information on currency exchange risk appears in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Other risks attendant to our foreign operations are set forth in Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Information on the impact of currency exchange on our Consolidated Financial Statements appears in Part II, Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; Financial information showing net sales and total long-lived assets by geographic region for each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 appears in Note 4, &#8220;Segments,&#8221; which information is incorporated herein by reference. We maintain programs to comply with the various laws, rules and regulations related to the protection of the environment that we may be subject to in the many countries in which we operate. See Part II, Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Environmental Matters.&#8221; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 23,000 employees worldwide. Approximately 6,500 of these employees were in the U.S., with approximately 150 of these employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the approximately 16,500 employees who were outside the U.S., approximately 9,800 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements related to 11% of our employees, primarily outside the U.S., will expire and we will be engaged in negotiations to attain new agreements. Many of the covered employees are represented by works councils or industrial boards, as is customary in the jurisdictions in which they are employed. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory. 

Marketing, Distribution and Custom ers 

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 7,100 sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors, fabricators, converters, e-commerce and mail order fulfillment firms, and contract packaging firms as well as directly to end-users such as food processors, foodservice businesses, supermarket retailers, lodging, retail, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare facilities, medical device manufacturers, and other manufacturers. 

To support our Food Care and New Ventures customers, we operate three Packforum &#174; innovation and learning centers that are located in the U.S., France, and China. At Packforum &#174; Centers, we assist customers in identifying the appropriate packaging materials and systems to meet their needs. We also offer ideation services, educational seminars, employee training and customized graphic design services to our customers. 

To assist our marketing efforts for our Product Care products and to provide specialized customer services, we operate 29 industrial Package Design Centers (PDCs) worldwide within our facilities. These PDCs are staffed with professional packaging engineers and outfitted with drop-testing and other equipment used to develop, test and validate cost-effective package designs to meet each Product Care customer&#8217;s needs. 

To support our equipment systems and the marketing of our totals systems solutions, we provide field technical services to our customers worldwide. These services include system installation, integration and monitoring systems, repair and upgrade, operator training in the efficient use of our systems, qualification of various consumable and system combinations, and equipment layout and design. 

Our Food Care applications are largely sold direct, while most of our Product Care products and a portion of our Diversey Care products and solutions are sold through business supply distributors. 

We have no material long-term contracts for the distribution of our products. In 2015, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales. 

Seasonality 

Historically, net sales in our Food Care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, due to holiday events. Net sales in our Product Care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the mid-third quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season. Net sales in our Diversey Care segment have tended to be higher in the second quarter due to higher occupancy rates in European lodging. On a consolidated basis, there is little seasonality in the business, with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter. Our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality. Cash flow from operations has tended to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes, including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments. 

Other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including, but not limited to, changes in raw materials and other costs, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other non-recurring charges. 

Competition 

Competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. There are also other companies producing competing products that are well-established. Since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology, we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership. We invest approximately double the industry average on research and development as a percentage of net sales per year as compared with our packaging peers. 

There are other manufacturers of Food Care products, some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country. Competing manufacturers produce a wide variety of food packaging based on plastic, metals and other materials. We believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of (i) flexible food packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products, (ii) barrier trays for case-ready meat products in the principal geographic areas in which we offers those trays, and (iii) absorbent pads for food products to supermarkets and to meat and poultry processors in the U.S. 

Our Food Care hygiene solutions and Diversey Care solutions face a wide spectrum of competitors across each p roduct category. Competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous small, local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach. We compete globally on premium product offerings and application expertise, innovative pr oduct and dispensing equipment offerings, value-added solution delivery, and strong customer service and support. We differentiate our offerings from competitors by becoming the preferred partner to our customers, and by providing innovative, industry-lead ing products to make their facilities safer and healthier for both maintenance staff and building occupants. We believe our integrated solutions approach, which includes the supply of machines, tools, chemicals, processes and training to customers to drive productivity improvements, reduce total cost of ownership, reduce risk of food safety events and improve infection control to reduce healthcare acquired infections, is a unique competitive strength. Additionally, the quality, ease of use and environmental profile of our products are unique and have helped support long-standing, profitable relationships with many top customers. 

Our Product Care products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other packaging materials that customers use to provide protection against damage to their products during shipment and storage. Among the competitive materials are various forms of paper packaging products, expanded plastics, corrugated die cuts, strapping, envelopes, reinforced bags, boxes and other containers, and various corrugated materials, as well as various types of molded foam plastics, fabricated foam plastics, mechanical shock mounts, wood blocking and bracing systems, and a portfolio of automated packaging and fulfillment systems. We believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of air cellular cushioning materials containing a barrier layer, inflatable packaging, suspension and retention packaging, shrink films for industrial and commercial applications, protective mailers, polyethylene foam and polyurethane foam packaging systems in the principal geographic areas in which we sell these products. Additionally, due to internal technology development investments and due to the acquisition of B+ Equipment in 2015, we are a leader in automated void reduction systems technology and automated mailer technology. 

Competition for most of our Medical Applications products is based primarily on performance characteristics, service and price. 

Raw Materials and Purchasing 

Suppliers provide raw materials, packaging components, contract manufactured goods, equipment and other direct materials, such as inks, films and paper. Our principal raw materials are polyolefin and other petrochemical-based resins, as well as chemicals such as caustic soda, solvents, waxes, phosphates, surfactants, chelates, fragrances, paper and wood pulp products. Raw materials represent approximately one-third of our consolidated cost of sales. We also purchase corrugated materials, cores for rolls of products such as films and Bubble Wrap &#174; brand cushioning, inks for printed materials, bag-in-the-box containers, bottles, drums, pails, totes, aerosol cans, caps, triggers, valves, and blowing agents used in the expansion of foam packaging products. In addition, we offer a wide variety of specialized packaging equipment, some of which we manufacture or have manufactured to our specifications, some of which we assemble and some of which we purchase from suppliers. Equipment and accessories include industrial and food packaging equipment, dilution-control warewashing and laundry equipment, floor care machines and items used in the maintenance of a facility such as air care dispensers, floor care applicators, microfiber mops and cloths, buckets, carts and other cleaning tools and utensils. 

The vast majority of the raw materials required for the manufacture of our products and all components related to our equipment and accessories generally have been readily available on the open market, in most cases are available from several suppliers and are available in amounts sufficient to meet our manufacturing requirements. However, we have some sole-source suppliers, and the lack of availability of supplies could have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, as well as political instability and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers and suppliers of other raw materials. Due to by-product/co-product chemical relationships to the automotive and housing markets, several materials may become difficult to source. These factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials, curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers. We purchase some materials used in our packaging products from materials recycled in our manufacturing operations or obtained through participation in recycling programs. Although we purchase some raw materials under long-term supply arrangements with third parties, these arrangements follow market forces and are in line with our overall global purchasing strategy, which seeks to balance the cost of acquisition and availability of supply. 

We have a centralized supply chain organization, which includes centralized management of purchasing and logistic activities. Our objective is to leverage our global scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies and reduce our total delivered cost across all our regions. We do this while adhering to strategic performance metrics and stringent purchasing practices. 

Research and Development Activities 

We maintain a continuing effort to develop new products and improve our existing products and processes, including developing new packaging, chemical formulations and equipment, and related applications, using our intellectual property. From time to time, we also license or acquire technology developed by others. Our research and development projects rely on our technical capabilities in the areas of food science, materials science, chemistry and chemical engineering, package design and equipment engineering. Our research and development expense was $129 million in 2015, $135 million in 2014 and $133 million in 2013.

Our research and development activities are focused on end-use application. As a result, we operate: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

two food science laboratories located in the U.S. and Italy; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Five research and development laboratories focused on the development of cleaning and sanitation formulations, which are located in the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands, India and Brazil; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Nine equipment design centers in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands that focus on equipment and parts design and innovation to support the development of comprehensive systems solutions. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We are the owner or licensee of an aggregate of over 4,000 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, as well as an aggregate of over 10,600 United States and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that relate to many of our products, manufacturing processes and equipment. We believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. We file annually an average of 200 U.S. and foreign patent applications and 400 U.S. and foreign trademark applications. None of our reportable segments is dependent upon any single patent or trademark alone. Rather, we believe that our success depends primarily on our sales and service, marketing, engineering and manufacturing skills and on our ongoing research and development efforts. We believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents, applications, licenses or trademark registrations would not be material to our business or consolidated financial condition. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

As a manufacturer, we are subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the countries, jurisdictions and localities in which we operate. These cover: the safe storage and use of raw materials and production chemicals; the release of materials into the environment; standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. We review environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition. 

In some jurisdictions in which our packaging products are sold or used, laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate, among other things, minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed content and, more generally, the sale or disposal of packaging materials. We maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution. Various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regulate some of our products and require us to register certain products and comply with specified requirements. In the U.S., we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;). We are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that regulate products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and processed foods. In the U.S., these requirements are generally administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). To date, the cost of complying with product registration requirements and FDA compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Our emphasis on environmental, health and safety compliance provides us with risk reduction opportunities and cost savings through asset protection and protection of employees.
