 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Nature of Business 

We specialize in providing business information technology (IT) solutions to our customers. We optimize business and IT processes by using systems engineering methodologies, strategic planning, and system integration to add efficiency and value to our customers&#8217; business processes and to help our customers identify critical success factors in their business. 

We provide business IT solutions primarily to the healthcare industry. We are expanding our service offerings into select other professional industries as we are able to commercialize product ideas for developing markets. We are attempting to expand marketing of our previous radio-frequency identification, or RFID, research and development to: address location tracking issues in the healthcare industry, including issues surrounding patient care; optimize business processes for healthcare providers; improve reporting of incidents; and increase revenues for provided services. 

While we advance commercialization of our products, particularly Silver Key Solution as discussed below, we may also opportunistically investigate other technologies and operations that might diversify our business and provide an opportunity to enhance our value by leveraging our entrepreneurial skills, funding capabilities, and business contacts. We have not identified any such opportunity at this time. 

Product Lines 

In previous years, our research and development team, using a unique combination of radio-frequency, electrical, firmware, software, database, and systems engineering expertise, created complete, integrated business IT solutions, including hardware devices worn by individuals, communications equipment, complex databases, and software systems that provide advanced reporting and analysis tools. These solutions fall into four major categories: 

(1) Silver Key Solution 

(2) ChargeCatcher Revenue Recovery Services 

(3) Healthcare Software Solutions 

(4) Consulting Services 

We are currently focusing our efforts on our Silver Key Solution and ChargeCatcher products, as well as working to develop or acquire new complementary technologies. 

Silver Key Solution 

Silver Key Solution is our leading healthcare RFID solution that includes automatic patient fall detection, motion detection, identification of location within a facility, and proximity of facility employee to facility resident. Over time, we have continued to enhance the product offering to address the concerns of various transitional care, assisted living, and nursing care facilities. 

ChargeCatcher Revenue Recovery Services 

ChargeCatcher specifically targets revenue recovery in hospital environments. ChargeCatcher augments a hospital staff&#8217;s ability to capture lost revenue due to data-entry errors, missing charge sheets, or other process errors. We perform advanced data mining and statistical correlation methodologies on a hospital&#8217;s chargeable items, while also employing artificial intelligence algorithms, to identify services and materials that were expended but never billed. By reviewing the identified missed charges, hospitals can correct their processes going forward. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

ChargeCatcher fees are set on a contingency basis in which we are paid a percentage of the recovered additional revenue. This revenue model protects our customers if they have little lost revenue, while it benefits us for high-quality data analysis that results in identifying increased lost revenue. 

Healthcare Solutions 

Until late 2013, we were a value-added reseller for McKesson Corporation healthcare software and service packages. We sell, install, implement, support, and train on the following McKesson products: Medisoft Clinical, Lytec MD, and Total Practice Partner. 

Consulting Services 

Until late 2013, we provided consulting services to customers needing assistance with various aspects of their IT services. We also offered enterprise IT assessments, policy and procedure review and creation, IT strategic planning, and project management and planning. 

2015 Activities 

On October 27, 2015, we entered into a letter of intent with The Ameriglobal Senior Living Group, Inc. (ASLG). Under the terms of the letter of intent, ASLG is currently carrying out a beta trial of our Silver Key Solution product line, which will include peer review, at two senior healthcare facilities in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The trial is intended to determine the viability of the Silver Key Solution product line for the medical industry as a professional medical management and tracking solution that addresses problem areas in the healthcare segment, including issues surrounding patient care, optimized business processes to the healthcare providers, improved reporting of incidents, and increased revenues for provided services. 

If the results of the beta trial justify further commercialization of the Silver Key Solution product line, the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith a technology transfer agreement that provides for ASLG to market and sell Silver Key Solution products throughout the United States (but not internationally) in consideration of a cash payment and royalty on all sales during the ensuing 10 years. 

2015 Investment Agreement 

On March 23, 2015, we entered into an Investment Agreement dated March 12, 2015, with JPF Venture Group, Inc. (&#8220;JPF&#8221;). Before entering into this agreement, there was no material relationship between us and our affiliates and JPF and its affiliates. 

Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, JPF purchased for $100,000 in cash 29,372,277 shares of our common stock at $0.003405 per share (the &#8220;JPF Stock&#8221;) and a warrant to purchase up to 1,033,585 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.003 per share. JPF is an investment entity that is majority-owned by Jeremy P. Feakins (&#8220;Feakins&#8221;). The JPF Stock represents a 55% ownership interest by JPF in us, without giving effect to the issuance of additional shares of our common stock on the conversion of outstanding convertible notes. 

JPF&#8217;s investment was used principally to initiate and pursue an updated technical and commercialization review of our intellectual properties with a view toward possible broadened marketing introduction and, in general, advance our business activities and bring our regulatory filings current. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Concurrently with the execution of the Investment Agreement, Antoinette Knapp Hempstead and the estate of her late husband, David W. Hempstead (together, the &#8220;Hempsteads&#8221;), JPF, and Feakins entered into an agreement whereby, among other things: (i) JPF agreed to execute supplemental guarantees for the Hempsteads in connection with certain debt obligations to economic development entities owed by us and guaranteed by the Hempsteads; (ii) the Hempsteads transferred to JPF the consolidated convertible note payable by us to the Hempsteads with an outstanding principal balance of $394,380 as of December 31, 2014, together with accrued and unpaid payroll of $213,436, for a total of $607,816; and (iii) the Hempsteads returned to us for cancellation 1,200,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which were cancelled. We have filed a Certificate of Withdrawal of Certificate of Designation for the preferred stock with the Nevada Secretary of State. 

As required by the Investment Agreement, two designees of JPF, Feakins and Peter Wolfson, were appointed as our directors to replace incumbent directors Orville J. Hendrickson and Larry J. Ybarrondo, who resigned. See Change in Directors and Management below. 

2015 Agreement and Plan of Merger 

Also on March 23, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation (&#8220;OTE&#8221;), under which we would have acquired OTE in exchange for what would have constituted 95% of our outstanding stock, after giving effect to the transaction. Before entering into this agreement, there were no material relationships between us and our affiliates and OTE and its affiliates. 

The completion of our acquisition of OTE was subject to a number of conditions, including approval of the transaction to the OTE shareholders by the California Corporations Commission, No action was taken on that application after nine months of consideration, so the parties agreed to terminate the proposed acquisition, with each party paying its own costs. 

Research and Development 

We incurred costs of $0 and $341 for research and development for our operations during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe our intellectual properties are critical to our business and growth. We rely on trade secret protection; confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, customers, and others with whom we interact; and patent laws to protect our proprietary rights. We do not believe that our business IT solutions segment is dependent upon, or obtains a competitive advantage from, our patents or that the expiration of any patent would materially affect our business. 

We frequently review our research and development efforts and product identification needs to consider whether we should seek additional patent or trademark protection for new developments or product offerings. Our 2013 patent application covering components of the Silver Key Solution processes is now considered abandoned due to lack of funds to continue the application process. We may seek patent protection for any novel enhancements we may invent. 

We do not believe that any of our products or other proprietary rights infringe upon the rights of third parties. However, we cannot assure that others may not assert infringement claims against us in the future and recognize that any such assertion may require us to incur legal and other defense costs, enter into compromise royalty arrangements, or terminate the use of some technologies. Further, we may be required to incur legal and other costs to protect our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had one employee, Jeremy P. Feakins, who is employed as our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. 

Government Regulation; Environmental Compliance 

Our activities are not subject to present or expected probable material governmental regulation, including environmental laws. 

Competition 

The market for IT services and products is intensely competitive and highly fragmented, with minimal barriers to entry. We expect competition to increase in the future, and we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

Potential competitors may have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, technical, marketing, and human resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

devote greater resources to developing, marketing, or selling their products; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and technical advances and changes in customer requirements, which could render our technologies and products obsolete; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

introduce products that make the continued development of our current and future products uneconomical; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our products; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

withstand price competition more successfully than we can; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily than we can. 

In our business IT solutions segment, we believe competition is based principally on providing resourceful creative solutions at competitive prices with quick, responsive service. We cannot assure that our efforts to meet these competitive factors will be successful. 

Other Opportunities 

To diversify risk and provide additional potential sources of revenue while we continue efforts to commercialize our products, principally Silver Key Solution at this time, we may seek to identify other opportunities for possible expansion or acquisition. We believe that we may be able to increase the commercial value of other products, technologies, and operations that we may seek through the application of the entrepreneurial, fundraising, management, marketing, and other skills of our management and executives we may recruit. We have not identified any such target products, technologies, or operations at this time. 

If we do identify other products, technologies, or operations, we may seek a commercial arrangement through a joint venture or strategic relationship, acquisition, or other arrangement. We may issue common stock and other securities to acquire and fund any such transaction, which may dilute the interests of current stockholders. We cannot assure that our efforts to identify, acquire, and operate any acquired products, technologies, or operations will be successful.
