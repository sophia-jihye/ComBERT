 Item 1. Business 

Background 

The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of bulk distribution and medical office real estate. 

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986. 

The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning 99.0% &#32;of the common partnership interests of the Partnership ("General Partner Units") at December 31, 2015 . The remaining 1.0% &#32;of the common partnership interests ("Limited Partner Units" and, together with the General Partner Units, the "Common Units") are owned by limited partners. Limited Partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement"), the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner. 

At December 31, 2015 , our diversified portfolio of 587 &#32;rental properties (including 70 &#32;jointly controlled in-service properties with more than &#32; 19.1 million &#32;square feet, 25 &#32;consolidated properties under development with approximately &#32; 5.9 million &#32;square feet and three &#32;jointly controlled properties under development with more than &#32; 1.9 million &#32;square feet) encompassed approximately &#32; 142.6 million &#32;rentable square feet and was leased by a diverse base of approximately 1,600 tenants whose businesses include government services, manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, distribution, healthcare and professional services. We also owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), approximately 3,200 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,600 acres through purchase options. 

Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. We additionally have regional offices or significant operations in 21 other geographic or metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Central Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; New Jersey; Northern and Southern California; Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; Raleigh, North Carolina; St. Louis, Missouri; Savannah, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; Washington D.C.; and South Florida. We had more than 500 employees at December 31, 2015 . 

See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information related to our operational, asset and capital strategies. 

Reportable Operating Segments 

We have four reportable operating segments at December 31, 2015 , the first three of which consist of the ownership and rental of (i) industrial, (ii) medical office and (iii) office real estate investments. Properties not included in our 

- 3 - 

reportable segments, which do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment, are generally referred to as non-reportable Rental Operations. The operations of our industrial, medical office and office properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations, are collectively referred to as "Rental Operations." Although our office real estate investment segment did not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment for the year ended December 31, 2015, we have elected to continue to separately report it when considering that it was significant during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. 

The fourth reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contracting and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively referred to as "Service Operations." Our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted. See Item 6, "Selected Financial Data," Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for financial information related to our reportable segments. 

Competitive Conditions 

As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities. 

We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or on local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share, to the extent it is in markets or product types that align with our asset strategy (see Item 7), and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on strong customer relationships to provide third-party construction services across the United States. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our industrial, medical office and office customers not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility. 

All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply and demand of similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator. In addition, our Service Operations face competition from a considerable number of other real estate companies that provide comparable services, some of whom may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. 

Corporate Governance 

Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. The General Partner's system of governance reinforces this commitment and, as a limited partnership that has one general partner owning over 90% of the Partnership's common interest, the governance of the Partnership is necessarily linked to the corporate governance of the General Partner. Summarized below are the highlights of the General Partner's Corporate Governance initiatives.

Recent U.S. Federal Income Tax Legislation 

On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015, which changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders described under the heading "Federal Income Tax Considerations" in our Prospectus included in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed April 30, 2015. These changes are briefly summarized as follows: 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2017, the percentage of a REIT&#8217;s total assets that may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs is reduced from 25% to 20%. 

- 5 - 

&#8226; 

For distributions in taxable years beginning after 2014, the preferential dividend rules no longer apply to us as a "publicly offered REIT," as defined in new Code Section 562(c)(2). 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs are treated as real estate assets for purposes of the 75% asset test, but interest on debt of a publicly offered REIT will not be qualifying income under the 75% gross income test unless the debt is secured by real property. Under a new asset test, not more than 25% of the value of a REIT&#8217;s assets may consist of debt instruments that are issued by publicly offered REITs and would not otherwise be treated as qualifying real estate assets. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, to the extent r ent attributable to personal property is treated as rents from real property (because rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15% of the total rent for the taxable year for such real and personal property), the personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test. Similarly, debt obligation secured by a mortgage on both real and personal property will be treated as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75% asset test, and interest thereon will be treated as interest on an obligation secured by real property, if the fair market value of the personal property does not exceed 15% of the fair market value of all property securing the debt. 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2015, a 100% excise tax will apply to "redetermined services income," i.e., non-arm&#8217;s-length income of a REIT&#8217;s TRS attributable to services provided to, or on behalf of, the REIT (other than services provided to REIT tenants, which are potentially taxed as redetermined rents). 

&#8226; 

For taxable years beginning after 2014, the period during which dispositions of properties with net built-in gains from C corporations in carry-over basis transactions will trigger the built-in gains tax is reduced from ten years to five years. 

&#8226; 

A number of changes applicable to REITs are made to the FIRPTA rules for taxing non-US persons on gains from sales of US real property interests ("USRPIs"): 

&#8226; For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. 

&#8226; Effective December 18, 2015, new rules will simplify the determination of whether we are a &#8220;domestically controlled qualified investment entity.&#8221; 

&#8226; For dispositions and distributions after December 18, 2015, &#8220;qualified foreign pension funds&#8221; as defined in new Code Section 897(l)(2) and entities that are wholly owned by a qualified foreign pension fund are exempted from FIRPTA and FIRPTA withholding. New FIRPTA rules also apply to &#8220;qualified shareholders&#8221; as defined in new Code Section 897(k)(3). 

&#8226; For sales of USRPIs occurring after February 16, 2016, the FIRPTA withholding rate for sales of USRPIs and certain distributions generally increases from 10% to 15%.
