 ITEMS 1 AND 2: BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a mining company, and we own the Velarde&#241;a and Chicago precious metals mining properties and associated oxide and sulfide processing plants (the &#147;Velarde&#241;a Properties&#148;) in the State of Durango, Mexico, the El Quevar advanced exploration property in the province of Salta, Argentina, and a diversified portfolio of precious metals and other mineral exploration properties located primarily in or near historical precious metals producing regions of Mexico. The Velarde&#241;a Properties and the El Quevar advanced exploration property are our only material properties. Our management team is comprised of experienced mining professionals with extensive expertise in mineral exploration, mine construction and development and mine operations. Our principal offices are located in Golden, Colorado at 350 Indiana Street, Suite 800, Golden, CO 80401, and our registered office is the Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801. We also maintain an office at the Velarde&#241;a Properties in Mexico and exploration offices in Argentina and Mexico. 

&#160; 

Due to continuing net operating losses, we suspended mining and sulfide processing activities at our Velarde&#241;a Properties in November 2015 in order to conserve the asset until we are able to develop mining and processing plans that at then current prices for silver and gold indicate a sustainable positive operating margin (defined as revenues less costs of sales) or we are able to locate, acquire and develop alternative mineral sources that could be economically mined and transported to the Velarde&#241;a Properties for processing. 

&#160; 

In July 2015 we entered into a leasing agreement with Minera Hecla, S.A. de C.V. (&#147;Hecla&#148;), a Mexican corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Hecla Mining Company, which for a monthly fixed fee and a variable tonnage fee will allow Hecla to process its own material through our oxide plant at the Velarde&#241;a Properties for a period of up to 30 months. Hecla began processing material in mid-December 2015, and we expect to receive net cash under the lease of between $4.0 and $5.0 million in 2016. 

&#160; 

We are primarily focused on evaluating and searching for mining opportunities in North America (including Mexico) with high precious metal grades and low development costs with near term prospects of mining, and particularly properties within reasonable haulage distances of our Velarde&#241;a Properties, which may include the Santa Maria Mine located in the Parral District in Chihuahua State, Mexico, the Santa Rosa vein located in the San Luis del Cordero District in Durango or the Rodeo property located west of the Velarde&#241;a Properties in Durango. We also are focused on continuing to advance certain exploration properties located primarily in Mexico and on holding our El Quevar advanced exploration property in Argentina until we can find a partner to further advance the project. We also continue to review strategic opportunities from time to time. 

&#160; 

No Proven or Probable Mineral Reserves/Exploration Stage Company 

&#160; 

We are considered an exploration stage company under SEC criteria since we have not demonstrated the existence of proven or probable mineral reserves at our Velarde&#241;a Properties or any of our other properties. In Industry Guide 7, the SEC defines a &#147;reserve&#148; as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Proven or probable mineral reserves are those reserves for which (a) quantity is computed and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are spaced so closely that the geologic character is defined and size, shape and depth of mineral content can be established (proven) or the sites are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced but high enough to assume continuity between observation points (probable). Mineral Reserves cannot be considered proven or probable unless and until they are supported by a feasibility study, indicating that the mineral reserves have had the requisite geologic, technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Prior to suspending mining and processing at the Velarde&#241;a Properties in November 2015, we had revenues from the sale of silver, gold, lead and zinc products from the Velarde&#241;a and Chicago mines. We have not completed a feasibility study with regard to all or a portion of any of our properties to date. Any mineralized material discovered or extracted by us should not be considered proven or probable mineral reserves. As of December 31, 2015, none of our mineralized material met the definition of proven or probable mineral reserves. We expect to remain an exploration stage company for the foreseeable future, even though we were extracting and processing mineralized material. We will not exit the exploration stage until such time, if ever, that we demonstrate the existence of proven or probable mineral reserves that meet the guidelines under SEC Industry Guide 7. 

&#160; 

Company History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Delaware under the Delaware General Corporation Law in March 2009, and we are the successor to Apex Silver Mines Limited (&#147;Apex Silver&#148;) for purposes of reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). From March 2009 through September 2011, we focused on the advancement of our El Quevar silver project in Argentina. On September 2, 2011, we completed a business combination transaction with ECU Silver Mining Inc. (&#147;ECU&#148;) and now own the Velarde&#241;a and Chicago silver, gold and base metals mines located in the Velarde&#241;a mining district in the State of Durango, Mexico as further described under &#147;&#151;Velarde&#241;a Properties&#148;. Since the business combination with ECU, we have focused primarily on the further advancement and improvement of the Velarde&#241;a Properties, as well as identifying and establishing other mining opportunities with near term prospects. 

&#160; 

Corporate Structure 

&#160; 

Golden Minerals Company, headquartered in Golden, Colorado, is the operating entity through which we conduct our business. Following our September 2, 2011 business combination, ECU became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden Minerals, and three of ECU&#146;s wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries hold the assets and rights associated with the Velarde&#241;a Properties. We have a number of other wholly-owned subsidiaries organized throughout the world, including in Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean and Europe. We generally hold our exploration rights and properties through subsidiaries organized in the countries in which our rights and properties are located. 

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths and Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our business strategy is to establish Golden Minerals as a mid-tier precious metals mining company focused in Mexico. We also review strategic opportunities from time to time. 

&#160; 

Velarde&#241;a Properties. &#160; Due to continuing net operating losses, we suspended mining and sulfide processing activities at the Velarde&#241;a Properties in November 2015 in order to conserve the future value of the asset. We have placed the mine and sulfide processing plant on care and maintenance to enable a re-start of either the mine or the mill. Prior to shutdown, we generated payable metals in 2015 totaling approximately 465,000 silver equivalent ounces (equivalents calculated at 70:1 silver to gold), including approximately 327,000 ounces of silver and 1,975 ounces of gold. In July 2015, we leased the oxide plant to a third party, which for a monthly fixed fee and a variable tonnage fee will allow the third party to process its own material through the plant for up to 30 months.

&#160; 

El Quevar Project. &#160; We continue to hold our El Quevar property on care and maintenance and to reduce holding costs until we can find a partner to fund further exploration.

&#160; 

Exploration Focus. &#160; We are focused on evaluating and searching for mining opportunities in North America (including Mexico) with high precious metal grades and low development costs with near term prospects of mining, and particularly properties within reasonable haulage distances of our Velarde&#241;a Properties, which may include the Santa Maria Mine located in the Parral District in Chihuahua State, the Santa Rosa vein located in the San Luis del Cordero District in Durango or the Rodeo property located west of the Velarde&#241;a Properties in Durango. During 2015 we mined approximately 3,000 tonnes of material from the Santa Maria mine from a high grade portion of a mineralized vein as bulk samples, generating approximately 113 tonnes of concentrates containing about 47,000 ounces of silver and 80 ounces of gold. In November 2015, we acquired the mining rights for the Santa Rosa vein in the San Luis del Cordero Project. We started a drilling program in February 2016 to test extensions of the Santa Rosa vein on strike and to complete infill drilling. We also plan to drill at the Rodeo property in 2016 or early 2017 to explore for extensions of the near-surface gold mineralization that was identified by previous exploration. During 2016 we plan to focus our exploration efforts primarily on the Santa Maria mine and the Santa Rosa vein, and exploration on certain other properties. We expect our expenditures for the exploration program in 2016 to be approximately $2.2 million.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Experienced Management Team. &#160; We are led by a team of mining professionals with approximately 60 years of combined experience in exploration, project development, construction and operations all over the world. Our executive officers have held senior positions at various large mining companies including, among others, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company, INCO Limited, Meridian Gold Company, Barrick Gold Exploration and Noranda Exploration. Our executive team has a proven ability to manage large projects in challenging environments.

&#160; 

Velarde&#241;a Properties 

&#160; 

Location, Access and Facilities 

&#160; 

The Velarde&#241;a Properties are comprised of two underground mines and two processing plants within the Velarde&#241;a mining district, which is located in the municipality of Cuencam&#233;, in the northeast quadrant of the State of Durango, Mexico, approximately 65 kilometers southwest of the city of Torre&#243;n, Coahuila and approximately 140 kilometers northeast of the city of Durango, which is the capital of the State of Durango. The mines are reached by a seven kilometer road from the village of Velarde&#241;a which is reached by highway from Torre&#243;n and Durango. The Velarde&#241;a mining district is situated in a hot, semi-arid region. 

&#160; 

Of the two underground mines comprising the Velarde&#241;a Properties, the Velarde&#241;a mine includes five different major vein systems including the Terneras, Roca Negra, San Mateo, Santa Juana and San Juanes systems. During 2015 we mined from the San Mateo, Terneras and Roca Negra vein systems as well as the Santa Juana vein system to augment grades as mining and processing rates ramped up. 

&#160; 

We own a 300 tonne per day flotation sulfide mill situated near the town of Velarde&#241;a, which accounted for 100% of our revenue from saleable metals during 2015 and 2014. The mill includes lead, zinc and pyrite flotation circuits in which we can process the sulfide material to make lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates. Most of the silver and gold sold in 2014 and 2015 was contained in the lead concentrate. During 2015 we processed all our mined material through the sulfide plant. 

&#160; 

We also own a conventional 550 tonne per day cyanide leach oxide mill with a Merrill-Crowe precipitation circuit and flotation circuit located adjacent to our Chicago mine, which we previously used to process oxide and mixed sulfide/oxide material from the Velarde&#241;a Properties. In July 2015, we leased the oxide plant to a third party to process its own material through the plant for up to 30 months. The third party began processing material at the plant in December 2015. We continue to evaluate and search for other oxide and sulfide feed sources, focusing on sources within haulage distance of our sulfide and oxide mills at the Velarde&#241;a Properties. 

&#160; 

Prior to shutdown, we trucked material from the Velarde&#241;a mines to the sulfide plant. In January 2012 we completed a tailings pond expansion at the sulfide plant, which is fully permitted and has capacity to treat tailings for approximately four additional years at the average processing rate of 285 tpd. At the oxide plant, we completed the first stage of a new tailings pond during May 2013. Additional tailings expansion work at the oxide plant is planned for 2016 to accommodate tailings for the third party lessee, at the cost of the third party lessee. 

&#160; 

Power for all of the mines and plants is provided through substations connected to the national grid. Water is provided for all of the mines by wells located in the valley adjacent to the Velarde&#241;a Properties. We hold title to three wells located near the sulfide plant and hold certificates of registration to three wells located near the oxide plant. We are licensed to pump water from all six wells up to a permitted amount. We are currently pumping from the three wells associated with the oxide plant which is more than sufficient for the third party lessee&#146;s processing operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The following map shows the location of the Velarde&#241;a Properties. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Property History 

&#160; 

Exploration and mining in the Velarde&#241;a district extends back to at least the late 1500s or early 1600s, with large scale mining beginning in 1888 with the Velarde&#241;a Mining and Smelter Company. In 1902, the mining properties were acquired by ASARCO, who mined the property until 1926 when the mines were closed. For the next 35 years, the mines were operated from time to time by small companies and local miners. The property was nationalized in 1961, and in 1968 the sulfide processing plant was built by the Mexican government. In 1994, William Resources acquired the concessions comprising the Velarde&#241;a Properties. In 1997, ECU Gold (the predecessor to ECU Silver Mining Inc.) purchased from William Resources the subsidiaries that owned the concessions and the oxide processing plant. The sulfide processing plant was acquired in 2004.

&#160; 

Title and Ownership Rights 

&#160; 

We hold the concessions comprising the Velarde&#241;a Properties through our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries Minera William S.A. de C.V. At present, a total of 30 mineral concessions comprise the Velarde&#241;a Properties. The Velarde&#241;a Properties encompass approximately 895 hectares. The mineral concessions vary in size, and the concessions comprising each mineral property are contiguous within each of the Velarde&#241;a and Chicago properties. We are required to pay annual concession holding fees to the Mexican government to maintain our rights to the Velarde&#241;a mining concessions. In 2015, we made such payments totaling approximately $12,000 and expect to pay approximately $15,000 in 2016. We also own the surface rights to 144 hectares that contains the oxide plant, tailings area and access to the Chicago mine, along with surface lands that may be required for potential plant expansions. 

&#160; 

The Velarde&#241;a Properties are subject to the Mexican ejido system requiring us to contract with the local communities, or ejidos, surrounding our properties to obtain surface access rights needed in connection with our mining and exploration activities. We currently have contracts with two ejidos to secure surface rights for our Velarde&#241;a Properties with a total annual cost of approximately $25,000. We have a ten-year contract with the Velarde&#241;a ejido, which provides surface rights to certain roads and other infrastructure 

&#160; 

&#160; 

at the Velarde&#241;a Properties through 2021, and a 25-year contract with the Vista Hermosa ejido, which provides exploration access and access rights for roads and utilities for our Velarde&#241;a Properties until 2038.

We hold water concessions in wells that provide water for the Velarde&#241;a Properties. In Mexico water concessions are granted by the National Commission of Water (&#147;CNA&#148;). Currently no new water concessions are being granted by the CNA; however companies can acquire water concessions through purchase or lease from current concession holders. We hold title to three wells located near the sulfide plant and hold certificates of registration to three wells located near the oxide plant. We are licensed to pump water from all six wells up to a permitted amount. We are required to make annual payments to the CNA to maintain our rights to these wells. In 2015 we made such payments totaling approximately $25,000 and expect to pay approximately the same amount in 2016. We are required to pay a fine to the CNA each year if we use too much water from a particular well or alternatively if we do not use a minimum amount of water from a particular well. During 2015 we did not incur any over usage or under usage fines. 

&#160; 

Geology and Mineralization 

&#160; 

The Velarde&#241;a district is located at the easternmost limit of the Sierra Madre Occidental on the boundary between the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Mesa Central sub-provinces. Both of these terrains are underlain by Paleozoic and possibly Precambrian basement rocks. 

&#160; 

The regional geology is characterized by a thick sequence of limestone and minor calcareous clastic sediments of Cretaceous age, intruded by Tertiary plutons of acidic to intermediate composition. During the Laramide Orogeny, the sediments were folded into symmetrical anticlines and synclines that were modified into a series of asymmetrical overturned folds by a later stage of compression. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

A series of younger Tertiary stocks have intruded the older Cretaceous limestone over a distance of approximately 15 kilometers along a northeast to southwest trend. The various mineral deposits of the Velarde&#241;a mining district occur along the northeast southwest axis and are spatially associated with the intrusions and their related alteration. 

&#160; 

An important northwest-southeast fracture system is associated with these intrusions and, in many cases, acts as the main focus of mineralization. The Velarde&#241;a Properties are underlain by a thick sequence of limestone that corresponds to rocks of the Aurora and Cuesta del Cura formations of Lower Cretaceous age. 

&#160; 

Several types of Tertiary intrusive rocks are present in the Velarde&#241;a district. The largest of these rocks outcrops on the western flank of the Sierra San Lorenzo and underlies a portion of the Velarde&#241;a Properties. It is referred to as the Terneras pluton and forms a northeast oriented, slightly elongated body, considered to represent a diorite or monzodiorite that outcrops over a distance of about 2.5 kilometers. The adjacent limestone has been altered by contact metamorphism (exoskarn), and locally the intrusive has been metamorphosed (endoskarn). 

&#160; 

The following is a description of the individual geological characteristics and mineralization found on each of the properties comprising the Velarde&#241;a and Chicago mines. 

&#160; 

Velarde&#241;a Mine 

&#160; 

The Santa Juana, Terneras, San Juanes and San Mateo vein deposits on the Velarde&#241;a property are hosted by Aurora Formation limestone, the Terneras intrusion and related skarn. The limestone is intruded by a series of multiphase diorite or monzodiorite stocks (Terneras intrusion) and dikes of Tertiary age that outcrop over a strike length of approximately 2.5 kilometers. 

&#160; 

Two main vein systems are present on the Velarde&#241;a property. The first is a northwest striking system as found in the Santa Juana deposit, while the second is east-west trending and is present in the Santa Juana, Terneras, San Juanes and San Mateo deposits. 

&#160; 

In the Santa Juana deposit, two main sets of vein trends are observed. The most significant is a steeply northeast dipping, northwest trending set that has acted as the main conduit for the mineralizing fluids in the Santa Juana deposit. This direction includes both linear and curved northwest vein sets. 

&#160; 

The Terneras, San Juanes and San Mateo veins all strike east-west and dip steeply north. The most extensive of these is the Terneras vein, which was mined in the past over a strike length of 1,100 meters. All of these veins are observed to have extensive strike lengths and vertical continuity for hundreds of meters. The mineralogy of the east west system is somewhat different in that it contains less arsenic than the northwest Santa Juana veins. 

&#160; 

Mineralization in the deposits located at the Velarde&#241;a mine belongs primarily to epithermal calcite quartz veins with associated lead, zinc, silver, gold and copper mineralization, typical of the polymetallic vein deposits of northern Mexico. The veins are usually thin, normally in the 0.2 meter to 0.5 meter range, but consistent along strike and down dip. Coxcomb and rhythmically banded textures are common. 

&#160; 

Chicago Mine 

&#160; 

On the Chicago property, the oldest rocks outcropping are Cretaceous limestone of the Aurora Formation which are highly folded. This limestone is locally metamorphosed by the intrusion of the Tertiary dioritic stocks and dykes. The general geology of the Chicago property is very similar to the geology of the Velarde&#241;a property. The Chicago veins strike northeast and dip steeply southeast. Chicago ore tends to be higher in lead and zinc than the Santa Juana ore. Vein widths at Chicago are variable and tend to be narrower than at the Santa Juana deposit, especially in the skarn host . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

2014 Technical Report 

&#160; 

During the first quarter of 2015, the engineering firm of Tetra Tech, Inc. (&#147;Tetra Tech&#148;) completed an estimate of mineralized material at the Velarde&#241;a Properties, set forth in the following table:

* Amounts represent three-year average prices. 

&#160; 

The cutoff grade of $100 NSR per tonne of mineralized material was determined by adding the estimated average costs of mining ($53 per tonne), processing ($27 per tonne) and general and administration ($20 per tonne). The average cost estimates are the same for both the Velarde&#241;a and Chicago mines. The NSR value of mineralized material was determined for each type of mineralized material (sulfide, mixed, and oxide) by multiplying a fractional factor that represents an estimated combination of metallurgical recovery, treatment charges, penalties and payment terms by the unit value of each metal and then multiplying by the expected amount of that metal in each block of inventoried material. 

&#160; 

The following table shows the reduction in mineralized material reported in the Tetra Tech report that resulted from extraction and processing of mineralized material in 2015.

Additionally, silver ounces, zinc pounds and leads pounds are rounded to the nearest thousand and gold ounces are rounded to the nearest ounce and tonnes. The variance in rounding different commodities and units is for convenience and does not reflect any differences in the level of accuracy of the calculated mineralized material estimate.

&#160; 

Velarde&#241;a Properties 2015 Activities 

&#160; 

In November 2015 we suspended mining and sulfide processing activities at our Velarde&#241;a Properties in order to conserve the asset until we are able to develop mining and processing plans that at then current prices for silver and gold indicate a sustainable positive operating margin (defined as revenues less costs of sales) or we are able to locate, acquire and develop alternative mineral sources that could be economically mined and transported to the Velarde&#241;a Properties for processing. 

&#160; 

As a result of the shutdown of mining and sulfide processing activities at our Velarde&#241;a Properties, in the fourth quarter 2015, we incurred approximately $1.2 million in related costs for employee severance, material and supplies inventory write downs, and other shutdown expenditures to place the property on care and maintenance and expect to incur approximately $0.3 million in quarterly holding costs for as long as mining and processing activities remain suspended. We retained a core group of employees, most assigned to operate the oxide plant that is leased to a third party described below and not affected by the shutdown. The retained employees also include an exploration group and an operations and administrative group to continue to advance our plans in Mexico, oversee corporate compliance activities, and to maintain and safeguard the longer term value of the Velarde&#241;a assets. 

&#160; 

In July 2015 we leased our Velarde&#241;a oxide plant to a third party for an initial term of 18 months beginning July 1, 2015. The lease may be extended beyond the initial 18 month term for six additional months at the lessees&#146; option, and then for a subsequent six months unless we elect to use the plant to process material from our own sources. The lease contains typical covenants and termination rights. The third party is responsible for all costs associated with the start-up, operation and maintenance of the oxide plant. The third party began making nominal monthly payments to us beginning July 1, 2015 and began processing material in mid-December, which increased the monthly fixed fee under the lease and commenced variable charges for tonnes processed. Approximately 6,000 tonnes of material were processed at the leased oxide plant in December, resulting in revenues of approximately $130,000 in addition to fixed fees and reimbursable expenses. Once the third party reaches its intended capacity of approximately 400 tonnes per day, monthly payments to us, net of reimbursable costs, should total approximately $400,000 per month, including variable and fixed fees, or nearly $5.0 million annually.

&#160; 

2015 and 2014 Mining and Processing 

&#160; 

During 2015 the processing facilities generated approximately 465,000 payable silver equivalent ounces, including approximately 327,000 ounces of silver and 1,975 ounces of gold, and sold approximately 494,000 silver equivalent ounces. Silver equivalent ounces include silver and gold but exclude lead and zinc and are calculated at a ratio of 70 silver ounces to 1 gold ounce. Also, during 2015 the processing facilities generated approximately 1.1 million pounds of payable lead and 1.2 million pounds of payable zinc. Full year 2015 cash costs were $22.16 per payable silver ounce net of by-product credits. &#147;Cash costs per payable silver ounce, net of by-product credits&#148; is a non-GAAP financial measure defined below in &#147;Item 7 &#151;Non-GAAP Financial Measures &#148;. 

&#160; 

Payable metals and cash costs per payable silver ounce, net of by-product credits, were negatively impacted during 2015 by lower average grades of plant feed of 160 grams per tonne (&#147;gpt&#148;) silver and 2.6 gpt gold. Mined material delivered from stopes rather than access drives was lower than expected, resulting in higher than expected dilution and lower than expected grades delivered to the plant. During the year we used primarily shrinkage stope mining, standard mechanized cut and fill and overhand cut and fill mining methods. We also mined material from the Chicago mine during the third quarter to use for blending purposes to improve the lead content of the plant feed, which was also expected to have a positive impact on silver, gold and lead recoveries.

&#160; 

Mill throughput improved during 2015, with throughput of up to 370 tpd and an average rate of 252 tpd for the full year. Alterations to the pyrite concentrate circuit in the mill resulted in a small volume of gold bearing pyrite concentrates during the second half of 2015, although overall payable gold recovery was negatively impacted for the full year. 

&#160; 

The following table shows actual silver, gold and silver equivalent payables for the fourth quarter 2014 and for 2015 until we suspended mining and sulfide processing in mid-November 2015.

&#160; 

Product Mix 

&#160; 

During 2015, our mining plan called for the processing of mined material to make silver and gold bearing lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates. In 2015 we sold from the Velarde&#241;a Properties lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates containing payable quantities of silver, gold, lead and zinc, selling approximately 346,000 ounces of silver and approximately 2,114 ounces of gold. Silver sales accounted for approximately 60% and 70% of our revenue from saleable metals during 2015 and 2014, respectively, while gold sales accounted for approximately 30% and 30% of our revenue from saleable metals during 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

The sulfide plant at the Velarde&#241;a Properties contains a typical flotation circuit that processes material from the Velarde&#241;a Properties into lead, zinc and pyrite concentrate products. 

&#160; 

Lead concentrates comprise approximately 50% to 60% of total concentrate products from the sulfide plant. The lead concentrates have typical assays of 30% to 35% lead, 5,000 to 6,000 grams per tonne silver, 25 to 35 grams per tonne gold, 4% to 5% zinc and 3% to 5% copper. After metal deductions, we are typically paid for 95% of contained lead, silver and gold. Concentrate treatment charges are negotiated annually and generally reflect market terms for the industry for similar products. Treatment charges in 2015 were approximately $245 per tonne. Additional charges are incurred for silver and gold refining, and penalties are assessed for certain elements, such as arsenic and antimony that exceed agreed limits. 

&#160; 

Zinc concentrates comprise approximately 40% to 50% of total concentrate products from the sulfide plant. The zinc concentrates have typical assays of 50% to 55% zinc, 500 to 600 grams per tonne silver, 1 to 2 grams per tonne gold and 1% to 2% lead. After metal deductions, we are typically paid for approximately 80% of contained zinc and 55% of silver with lesser amounts payable for the contained gold. Concentrate treatment charges are negotiated annually and generally reflect market terms for the industry for similar products. Treatment charges in 2015 were approximately $249 per tonne. Additional charges are incurred for silver and gold refining, and penalties are assessed for certain elements, such as arsenic, that exceed agreed limits. 

&#160; 

We sold a small amount of pyrite concentrates during 2015 containing on average approximately 25 gpt gold. The pyrite concentrates will typically contain approximately 200 - 300 gpt silver and 33% to 38% sulfur. Concentrate treatment charges are renegotiated annually and generally reflect most industry key terms for similar products. Treatment charges in 2015 were approximately $120 per tonne with payment for approximately 70% of contained gold and no payment for silver. No additional charges were incurred for refining or penalties. 

&#160; 

In 2015 we incurred approximately $1.9 million in smelting and refining charges and approximately $0.3 million in penalty charges, primarily for arsenic and antimony included in our lead and zinc concentrates. Treatment and penalty charges are netted against revenue in our consolidated statement of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

During 2015 all of our revenues from mining were attributable to the sale of products from the Velarde&#241;a Properties, including lead, zinc and pyrite concentrates. In 2015 we sold lead, zinc and pyrite concentrate products to three customers under exclusive contracts, one of which expired in March 2015, one that expired in December 2015 and one that will expire in February 2016. These sales contracts include terms typical for the industry, including deductions for smelting and refining charges (or treatment charges) and penalties for contaminates present in our products sold. 

&#160; 

Our customer contracts, including the customer contracts that expired in March 2015 and December 2015 and the customer contract that will expire in February 2016 are the types that ordinarily accompany the kind of business conducted by us and our subsidiaries and were entered into in the ordinary course. Typically our customer contracts are not material in amount, and any contract that is material in amount is not a contract on which our business is substantially dependent. Most of our customer contracts are for a term of one year or less, and many of the contract terms are negotiable during the term of the contract. The global silver and gold markets are competitive with numerous refineries willing to buy concentrates on short notice. If any one of our customer contracts had been terminated, we had identified other customers during the bidding process as additional avenues in which to sell our product. We do not believe that a loss of one particular customer would have materially delayed, disrupted or reduced revenues. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters and Permitting 

&#160; 

We hold environmental licenses and environmental impact assessments that allow us to run our mines, plants and tailing facilities at our Velarde&#241;a Properties. We are required to update our environmental licenses and environmental impact assessments for expansion of or modification to any of the existing two processing plants. The construction of new infrastructure beyond the current plant facilities also would require additional permitting, which could include environmental impact assessments and land use permits. We do not expect to have difficulty obtaining additional permits or environmental impact assessments. 

&#160; 

Certain Laws Affecting Mining in Mexico 

&#160; 

Mexico, officially the United Mexican States, is a federal constitutional republic in North America and bordered by the United States of America, Belize and Guatemala. Mexico is a federal democratic republic with 31 states and one federal district. Each state has its own constitution and its citizens elect a governor, as well as representatives, to their respective state congresses. The President of Mexico is the head of the executive federal government. Executive power is exercised by the President, while legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Congress of the Union. The three constitutional powers are the Judiciary, the Executive and the Legislature which are independent of each other. 

&#160; 

Legislation Affecting Mining 

&#160; 

The Mining Law, originally published in 1992 and amended in 1996, 2005 and 2006, is the primary legislation governing mining activities in Mexico. Other significant legislation applicable to mining in Mexico includes the regulations to the Mining Law, the Federal Law of Waters, the Federal Labour Law, the Federal Law of Fire Arms and Explosives, the General Law on Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection and regulations, the Federal Law of Duties and the Federal Law on Metrology and Standards. 

&#160; 

The Concession System 

&#160; 

Under Mexican law, mineral deposits are property of the Mexican republic, and a mining concession, granted by the executive branch of the federal government, is required for the exploration, exploitation and processing of mineral deposits. Mining concessions may only be granted to Mexican individuals domiciled in Mexico or companies incorporated and validly existing under the laws of Mexico. Mexican companies that have foreign shareholders must register with the National Registry of Foreign Investments and renew their registration on an annual basis. Mining concessions grant rights to explore and exploit mineral deposits but do not grant surface rights over the land where the concession is located. Mining concession holders are required to negotiate surface access with the land owner or holder (e.g., agrarian communities) or, should such negotiations prove unsuccessful, file an application with the corresponding administrative authority (Ministry of Economy or Ministry of Agrarian-Territorial-Urban Development) to obtain an easement, temporary occupancy, or expropriation of the land, as the case may be. An application for a concession must be filed with the Mining Agency or Mining Delegation located closest to the area to which the application relates. 

&#160; 

Mining concessions have a term of 50 years from the date on which title is recorded in the Public Registry of Mining. Holders of mining concessions are required to comply with various obligations, including the payment of certain mining duties based on the number of hectares of the concession and the number of years the concession has been in effect. Failure to pay the mining duties can lead to cancellation of the relevant concession. Holders of mining concessions are also obliged to carry out and prove assessment works in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Mining Law and its regulations. The regulations to the 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Mining Law establish minimum amounts that must be spent or invested on mining activities. A report must be filed in May of each year regarding the assessment works carried out during the preceding year. The mining authorities may impose a fine on the mining concession holder if one or more proof of assessment work reports is not timely filed. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to amendments to the federal corporate income tax law, effective January 2014, additional duties are imposed on mining concession holders; see &#147;&#151; Taxes in Mexico &#148;. 

&#160; 

Environmental Legislation 

&#160; 

Mining projects in Mexico are subject to Mexican federal, state and municipal environmental laws and regulations for the protection of the environment. The principal legislation applicable to mining projects in Mexico is the federal General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection, which is enforced by the Federal Bureau of Environmental Protection, commonly known as &#147;PROFEPA&#148;. PROFEPA is the federal entity in charge of carrying out environmental inspections and negotiating compliance agreements. Voluntary environmental audits, coordinated through PROFEPA, are encouraged under the federal General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection. PROFEPA monitors compliance with environmental legislation and enforces Mexican environmental laws, regulations and official standards. If warranted, PROFEPA may initiate administrative proceedings against companies that violate environmental laws, which proceedings may result in the temporary or permanent closure of non-complying facilities, the revocation of operating licenses and/or other sanctions or fines. According to the Federal Criminal Code, PROFEPA must inform the relevant governmental authorities of any environmental crimes that are committed by a mining company in Mexico. 

&#160; 

Concession holders may submit themselves to comply with the Mexican Official Norm: NOM-120-SEMARNAT-1997, which provides, among other things, that mining exploration activities to be carried out within certain areas must be conducted in accordance with the environmental standards set forth in NOM-120-SEMARNAT-1997; otherwise, concession holders are required to file a preventive report or an environmental impact study prior to the commencement of the exploration, exploitation and processing of mineral resources. An environmental impact study may not be necessary if the concessionaire files an application with the environmental authorities confirming the concessionaire&#146;s commitment to observe and comply with NOM-120-SEMARNAT-1997. 

&#160; 

In 2014 Mexico developed an Energy sector applicable to private investment companies whereby new mining concessions are now subject to prior approval from the Ministry of Energy. Current mining concessions forming the Velarde&#241;a Properties are not subject to or affected by this approval requirement, but any new mining concessions acquired will be subject to this additional approval. 

&#160; 

Taxes in Mexico 

&#160; 

Mexico has a federal corporate income tax rate of 30%, and there are no state taxes on corporate net income. In determining their corporate income tax, entities are allowed to subtract from gross income various deductions permitted by law, and they are allowed a ten-year carry-forward of net operating losses. Pursuant to amendments to the federal tax laws effective January 1, 2014, a 10% withholding tax is charged on dividends distributed to shareholders, regardless of the tax residence of the recipient, out of after tax profits. However, in the case of nonresident shareholders the limitations and tax rates provided in the treaties to avoid double taxation will prevail. A foreign resident company is subject to income tax if it has a permanent establishment in Mexico. In general, a permanent establishment is a place of business where the activities of an enterprise are totally or partially carried out and includes, among others, offices, branches and mining sites. 

&#160; 

Mexico has several taxes in addition to income tax that are relevant to most business operations, including (i) the Value Added Tax (&#147;VAT&#148;); (ii) import duties; (iii) various payroll taxes; (iv) statutorily entitled employee profit sharing (&#147;PTU&#148;); and (v) mining duties and royalties. In addition, annual mining concession fees are charged by the government. 

&#160; 

VAT in Mexico is charged upon alienation of goods, performance of independent services, grant of temporary use or exploitation of goods, or import of goods or services that occur within Mexico&#146;s borders, at a rate of 16%. There is no VAT in the case of export of goods or services or for the sale of gold, jewelry, and gold metalwork with a minimum gold content of 80%, excluding retail sale to the general public. The sale of mining concessions is subject to VAT as concessions are not considered to be land. VAT paid by a business enterprise on its purchases and expenses may usually be credited against its liability for VAT collected from customers on its own sales. In addition, VAT may also be refunded, or overpayments may be used to offset tax liabilities arising from other federal taxes. 

&#160; 

Import duties apply for goods and services entering the country, unless specifically exempted due to a free trade agreement or registered under specific programs like IMMEX, under which we are currently registered. Payroll taxes are payable in most states 

&#160; 

&#160; 

including Durango and Coahuila, and social security, housing and pension contributions must be made to the federal government when paying salaries. 

&#160; 

Employees of Mexico entities are statutorily entitled to a portion of the employer&#146;s pre-tax profits, called PTU. The rate of profit sharing is currently 10% of the employer&#146;s taxable income as defined by the Income Tax law. A taxpayer may reduce its income tax base by an amount equal to the PTU. Certain companies are exempt from paying PTU, which include companies in the extractive industry (principally the mining industry) during the period of exploration. 

&#160; 

Under the 2014 amendments to the federal corporate income tax law, titleholders of mining concessions are required to pay an annual special duty of 7.5% of their mining related profits, determined by deducting from mining related revenues certain specified types of cash expenditures. Payment of the special duty is due at the end of March each year commencing in 2015. 

&#160; 

Titleholders of mining concessions also are required to pay a 0.5% special mining duty, or royalty, on an annual basis, on revenues obtained from the sale of silver, gold and platinum. Similar to the 7.5% annual special duty, the 0.5% duty is due at the end of March each year commencing in 2015. 

&#160; 

El Quevar 

&#160; 

Location and Access 

&#160; 

Our El Quevar silver project is located in the San Antonio de los Cobres municipality, Salta Province, in the altiplano region of northwestern Argentina, approximately 300 kilometers by road northwest of the city of Salta, the capital city of the province. The project is also accessible by a 300 kilometer dirt and gravel road from the city of Calama in northern Chile. The small village of Pocitos, located about 20 kilometers to the west of El Quevar, is the nearest settlement. We have established a camp approximately 10 kilometers west of the project to house project workers. A high tension power line is located approximately 40 kilometers from the site, and a high pressure gas line devoted to the mining industry and subsidized by the Salta government is located within four kilometers of the El Quevar camp. 

&#160; 

The El Quevar project is located near Nevado Peak with altitudes at the concessions ranging from 3,800 to 6,130 meters above sea level. The climate of the area is high mountain desert, with some precipitation in summer (such as snow) and little snow in winter. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The following map shows the location of the El Quevar project. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Property History 

&#160; 

Mining activity in and around the El Quevar project dates back at least 80 years. Between 1930 and 1950, there was lead and silver extraction of mineralized materials from small workings in the area, but we have no mining records from that period. The first organized exploration activities on the property occurred during the 1970s, although no data from that period remains. Over the last 30 years, several companies have carried out exploration activity in the area, including BHP Billiton, Industrias Pe&#241;oles, Mansfield Minerals and Hochschild Mining Group, consisting primarily of local sampling with some limited drilling programs. 

&#160; 

Title and Ownership Rights 

&#160; 

According to Argentine law, mineral resources are subject to regulation in the provinces where the resources are located. Each province has the authority to grant mining exploration permits and mining exploitation concession rights to applicants. The Federal Congress has enacted the National Mining Code and other substantive mining legislation, which is applicable throughout Argentina; however, each province has the authority to regulate the procedural aspects of the National Mining Code and to organize the enforcement authority within its own territory. 

&#160; 

In the province of Salta, where the El Quevar project is located, all mining concessions are granted by a judge in the Salta Mining Court. The El Quevar project is comprised of exploitation concessions. Exploitation concessions are subject to a canon payment fee (maintenance fee) which is paid in advance twice a year (before June 30th and December 31st of each calendar year). Each time a new mining concession is granted, concession holders are exempt from the canon payment fee for a period of three years from the concession grant date. However, this exemption does not apply to the grant of vacant exploitation concessions; only to the grant of new mining concessions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The El Quevar project is currently comprised of 31 mining concessions we hold directly. In total, the El Quevar project encompasses approximately 57,000 hectares. The area of most of our exploration activities at El Quevar is within the concessions that are owned by Silex Argentina S.A., our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

&#160; 

We are required to pay a 1% net smelter return royalty on the value of all minerals extracted from the El Quevar II concession and a 1% net smelter return royalty on one-half of the minerals extracted from the Castor concession to the third party from whom we acquired these concessions. We can purchase one half of the royalty for $1 million in the first two years of production. The Yaxtch&#233; deposit is located primarily on the Castor concession. We are also required to pay a 3% royalty to the Salta Province based on the mine mouth value of minerals extracted from any of our concessions. To maintain all of the El Quevar concessions, in 2015, we paid canon payment fees to the Argentine government of approximately $74,000. In 2016 we expect to pay approximately $114,000. The annual amounts in 2015 and subsequent years result from the January 2015 amendment to the National Mining Code increasing the annual canon payment by approximately four times . 

&#160; 

The following El Quevar mine concessions are identified below by name and file number in the Salta Province Registry of Mines.

The surface rights at El Quevar are controlled by the Salta Province. There are no private properties within the concession area. To date, no issues involving surface rights have impacted the project. Although we have unrestricted access to our facilities, we have been granted easements to further protect our access rights. 

&#160; 

Geology and Mineralization 

&#160; 

The geology of the El Quevar project is characterized by silver-rich veins and disseminations in Tertiary volcanic rocks that are part of an eroded stratovolcano. Silver mineralization at El Quevar is hosted within a broad, generally east-west-trending structural 

&#160; 

&#160; 

zone and occurs as a series of north-dipping parallel sheeted vein zones, breccias and mineralized faults situated within an envelope of pervasively silicified brecciated volcanic rocks. There are at least three sub-parallel structures that extend for an aggregate length of approximately 6.5 kilometers. Several volcanic domes (small intrusive bodies) have been identified and mineralization is also found in breccias associated with these domes, especially where they are intersected by the structures. The silver mineralization at the Yaxtch&#233; zone is of epithermal origin. The cross-cutting nature of the mineralization, the assemblage of sulfide and alteration minerals, and the presence of open spaces with euhedral minerals, all point to an origin at shallow to moderate depths (a few hundred meters below surface) from hydrothermal solutions. 

&#160; 

2012 Technical Report 

&#160; 

During 2012 RungePincockMinarco (&#147;RPM&#148;) completed an updated estimate of mineralized material at our El Quevar project. This SEC Industry Guide 7 estimate assumed mining of oxide material from an open pit on the east end of the Yaxtch&#233; deposit and sulfide material from both the open pit and an underground mine on the western portion of the Yaxtch&#233; deposit. According to the RPM estimate, based on results from 270 core drill holes, mineralized material in the Yaxtch&#233; zone, at a cut-off grade of 26 grams per tonne silver for the open pit and 100 grams per tonne silver for underground material, and using a three-year average silver price of $24.41 per ounce, was as follows:

The RPM estimate includes a smaller tonnage of mineralized material in the possible open pit at a higher likely grade as compared to the technical report prepared by RPM pursuant to Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (&#147;43-101&#148;). In the RPM report pursuant to 43-101, RPM used inferred resources beneficially to the possible operation in the optimization of a resource level open pit. When preparing its mineralized material estimate under Industry Guide 7, RPM did not use the inferred resources calculated pursuant to 43-101 to beneficially optimize the pit. As such, optimization without the benefit of inferred material yielded a smaller tonnage of mineralized material in the possible open pit at a higher likely grade as compared to the RPM report pursuant to 43-101.

&#160; 

Exploration and Advancement of El Quevar 

&#160; 

The Yaxtch&#233; deposit is the primary target currently identified at the El Quevar project. We believe that the El Quevar deposit may be amenable to bulk mining, which could include an open pit on the eastern and central areas of the Yaxtch&#233; deposit and bulk underground mining in the western area. Our work indicates that the Yaxtch&#233; deposit is at least 2 kilometers in strike length and is continuous laterally and to depths of more than 300 meters below surface in the main area. More recent results also support a possible eastward extension of the Yaxtch&#233; deposit and recognize an emerging new mineralized trend five kilometers north of the Yaxtch&#233; deposit. We continue to hold our El Quevar property on care and maintenance until we can find a partner to fund further exploration. We have completed environmental baseline studies, and a further environmental impact assessment process would be required to support the permits necessary for construction and mining. If the El Quevar project proceeds to development and construction, we would be required to obtain numerous additional permits from national, provincial and municipal authorities in Argentina. 

&#160; 

In 2015 we spent approximately $1.1 million at our El Quevar project on holding and maintenance costs. From the inception of our exploration activities in 2004 through December 31, 2015 we have spent approximately $75.3 on exploration and related activities at El Quevar. In 2016 we expect to spend approximately $0.5 million at our El Quevar project on maintenance and holding costs. 

&#160; 

Exploration Properties 

&#160; 

In addition to El Quevar, we currently control a portfolio of approximately 10 exploration properties located primarily in certain traditional precious metals producing regions of Mexico. We do not consider any of our exploration properties to be material, including those noted below. 

&#160; 

In 2016 we plan to focus our exploration efforts primarily on the Santa Maria Mine located in the Parral District in Chihuahua State, the Santa Rosa vein located in the San Luis del Cordero District in Durango State, and possibly the Rodeo property located west of the Velarde&#241;a Properties in Durango. During 2016 we expect our expenditures for the exploration program to total approximately $2.2 million, with approximately $0.3 million in property holding costs in Mexico and approximately $0.5 million in administrative and general reconnaissance costs in Mexico. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

San Luis del Cordero 

&#160; 

We acquired the mining rights for the Santa Rosa vein in the San Luis del Cordero Project in Durango State in November 2015 pursuant to an exploration and exploitation agreement with a wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary of Prospero Silver Corp. (&#147;Prospero&#148;). The Santa Rosa vein is approximately two meters wide and as currently defined extends for about 400 meters on strike. Silver grades as reported from previous limited drilling average between 700 and 800 gpt over a two meter width in the Santa Rosa vein below the historic stopes. Records show that the Santa Rosa vein has been mined to a depth of about 100 meters.

&#160; 

We started a $0.5 million drilling program in February 2016 to test extensions of the Santa Rosa vein on strike and to complete infill drilling. Our objective is to increase the size and improve the certainty of estimates of the tonnes and grade of the deposit. If our exploration results are successful, we expect to issue an estimate of mineralized material and an NI 43-101 resource estimate and preliminary economic analysis in 2016. The preliminary results of our initial metallurgical testing of material from the Santa Rosa vein indicate that the material is suitable for concentration by flotatio n. 

&#160; 

If the results of our exploration and metallurgical work are successful, we could mine the vein from the existing underground mine following completion of certain rehabilitation and access projects. We would use primarily mining equipment from our shutdown Velarde&#241;a Properties and truck mined material less than 100 kilometers on paved roads to our recently idled Velarde&#241;a sulfide mill for processing. We may require external financing to fund capital and working capital costs associated with mining the Santa Rosa vein, preliminarily estimated at approximately $3 to $4 million . 

&#160; 

Under our agreement with Prospero, we paid Prospero $140,000 on signing and are required to pay $100,000 annually until production begins. We must complete a minimum of 2,000 meters of drilling within the next 18 months and commence production within three years. Once mining and processing begin, we would be required to pay Prospero 15% of net proceeds from the sale of concentrates from the property and an underlying 2% net smelter return royalty to a third party. We would be responsible for all of the costs of exploration, preparation for mining, mining, processing and sales, for which we would receive a credit in the net proceeds calculation. 

&#160; 

Santa Maria 

&#160; 

In August 2014, we entered into an option agreement giving us the right to acquire for $1.2 million the Santa Maria mine, a privately held property comprised of a single mining claim of 18 hectares west of Hildalgo de Parral, Chihuahua State, Mexico. During the third quarter 2015 we mined approximately 3,000 tonnes of material from the vein as bulk samples at a total cost of about $250,000 and entered into a contract to process the material for metallurgical and process testing purposes at a local third-party toll milling facility at a cost of about $100,000. The extracted material, mined from a high grade portion of the vein, had grades of approximately 500 gpt silver and 0.9 gpt gold. We do not have sufficient drilling data to predict the ultimate size of this higher grade zone. The 3,000 tonnes of mined material processed through the toll milling facility generated approximately 113 tonnes of concentrates containing approximately 47,000 ounces of silver and 80 ounces of gold. Under an October 2015 sales agreement, we received proceeds for approximately 32,000 ounces of silver and 45 ounces of gold with a net payable value of about $370,000. As required by the option agreement, we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the concentrates to pay the claim owner an advance royalty payment of $160,000, credited toward the $1.2 million purchase price of the property, with the remaining proceeds used to reimburse our costs for exploration and mining activities at Santa Maria since April 2015. 

&#160; 

Rodeo 

&#160; 

We acquired the Rodeo and Rodeo 2 claims comprising 1,866 hectares 80 kilometers west of the Velarde&#241;a Properties in Durango, Mexico where previous exploration by other companies has identified a gold-bearing epithermal system exposed at the surface. We plan to conduct a 2,000 meter core drilling program in 2016 or early 2017 at an estimated cost of $300,000 to $400,000. If our exploration efforts are successful, material from these properties could be trucked to the Velarde&#241;a oxide plant for processing after the third party lease has terminated. Our cost to maintain the Rodeo properties includes advance royalty payments to La Cuesta International of $5,000 in 2015 and $10,000 in 2016. La Cuesta holds a 2% net smelter return royalty on production from the claims up to a total payable amount of $5.0 million. Our agreement requires a minimum program of 1,000 meters of drilling before May 2017. Payments to the Mexican government to maintain the claims totaled approximately $20,000 in 2015 and are expected to total about $30,000 in 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Celaya 

&#160; 

Our Celaya properties total 6,200 hectares encompassing a strongly developed alteration system on the main Mexico Silver Belt trend located approximately 10 kilometers east of the Plata Latina Naranjillo discovery and 45 kilometers southeast of and on trend with the historic Guanajuato District. Since 2012 we have been conducting mapping and sampling exploration activities on the properties. We completed during the second quarter of 2015 a 2,000 meter, three-hole drilling program, which identified epithermal gold and silver mineralization beneath a portion of the widespread clay-silica alteration on the claims comprising the Celaya project. The Company has entered into discussions with a third party regarding a potential farm-out of the project. 

&#160; 

Zacatecas 

&#160; 

Our 100% controlled Zacatecas silver and base metals project in Mexico is an exploration stage property that we have drilled in the past. Although we believe that the Zacatecas project may contain significant silver and other mineralization, we have not completed a mineralized material estimate or NI 43-101resource study on the property, and the property may not advance further . 

&#160; 

The Zacatecas Mining District is located in the central part of Mexico, in the main Mexico Silver Belt. Our Zacatecas project surrounds the municipalities of Zacatecas, Veta Grande, Guadalupe, P&#225;nuco, and Morelos in the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. We own approximately 149 concessions totaling approximately 7,900 hectares in the Zacatecas project . 

&#160; 

To maintain all of the concessions in the Zacatecas project, we pay approximately $120,000 per year to the Mexican government. We are party to a finder&#146;s fee agreement with an individual, which requires that we pay a 1% net smelter return royalty on any mineral production from certain of our Zacatecas claims. We also have the obligation to pay a 1% net smelter return royalty on the San Sabino concession, which we may buy back for $1.0 million and a 2% net smelter return royalty on the San Gil concession. For the San Gil concession, on the first anniversary of production, we would be required to purchase the San Gil royalty for $575,000 and the San Gil royalty would terminate. 

&#160; 

San Diego 

&#160; 

We own a 50% interest in the San Diego silver exploration property, which is subject to a joint venture agreement between ECU and Golden Tag Resources Ltd. (&#147;Golden Tag&#148;), with each company holding 50% of the joint venture. The property consists of four concessions and the exploration activities of the joint venture are currently managed by Golden Tag. Until March 2017, Golden Tag has the option to earn an additional 10% interest in this joint venture by making expenditures related to further exploration drilling and completing an updated resource assessment. We hold the concessions in the San Diego property through our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary Minera William S.A. de C.V . 

&#160; 

The San Diego property, located in the State of Durango, Mexico, is situated approximately nine kilometers northeast of the Velarde&#241;a Properties and contains the La Cruz-La Rata and El Trovador mines as well as a number of other shallower shafts which were sunk on narrower veins such as the Cantarranas, Montanez and El Jal. The mineralization at San Diego is similar in many respects to that at our Velarde&#241;a Properties but contains less gold . 

&#160; 

Farm-outs, Royalties and Other Dispositions 

&#160; 

Exploration properties that we choose not to advance are evaluated for joint venture, sale of all or a partial interest and royalty potential. We currently have minority ownership interests and/or royalties in or have disposed of the following properties that were once part of our exploration portfolio: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Zacatecas Royalty (Mexico) . With respect to certain concessions in a portion of our Zacatecas project in Mexico sold to a subsidiary of Capstone Mining Corp. in 2009, we are entitled to a net smelter return of 1.5% on the first one million tonnes of production, and a 3% net smelter return on production in excess of one million tonnes. The net smelter return on production in excess of one million tonnes escalates by 0.5% for each $0.50 increment in copper price above $3.00 per pound of copper. There is currently no production on these concessions.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Fortuna Royalty (Peru) . We are entitled to a net smelter return of 2.5% from a mining claim in Peru we sold to Compa&#241;ia Minera Fortuna in August 2012. There is currently no production related to this claim.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Zacatecas Concessions (Mexico) . During the third quarter 2014 we sold 45 mining concessions totaling 770 hectares located in the Zacatecas District, Zacatecas State, Mexico, to Capstone Mining Group for the sum of $700,000 and recorded a $0.5 million gain on the sale.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Minera Silex Peru Sale (Peru) . During the third quarter 2014 we entered into an option agreement with a private party to sell our 1,100 hectare Peruvian Otuzco property for $450,000; the sale was completed in 2015.

Metals Market Overview 

&#160; 

We are an emerging precious metals exploration company with silver and gold mining properties in Mexico and a large silver advanced exploration project in Argentina. Descriptions of the markets for these metals are provided below. 

&#160; 

Silver Market 

&#160; 

Silver has traditionally served as a medium of exchange, much like gold. Silver&#146;s strength, malleability, ductility, thermal and electrical conductivity, sensitivity to light and ability to endure extreme changes in temperature combine to make it a widely used industrial metal. While silver continues to be used as a form of investment and a financial asset, the principal uses of silver are industrial, primarily in electrical and electronic components, photography, jewelry, silverware, batteries, computer chips, electrical contacts, and high technology printing. Silver&#146;s anti-bacterial properties also make it valuable for use in medicine and in water purification. Additionally, the use of silver in the photovoltaic and solar panel industries is growing rapidly, and new uses of silver are being developed in connection with the use of superconductive wire and radio frequency identification devices. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Most silver product is obtained from mining in which silver is not the principal or primary product. The Silver Institute, an international silver industry association, noted that for 2014 only around 31% of output came from so-called primary silver mines, where silver is the main source of revenue. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth for the periods indicated on the London Fix high and low silver fixes in U.S. dollars per troy ounce. On February 24, 2016, the closing price of silver was $15.32 per troy ounce.

Gold Market 

&#160; 

Gold has two main categories of use: fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry. The supply of gold consists of a combination of production from mining and the draw-down of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth for the periods indicated on the London Fix PM high and low gold fixes in U.S. dollars per troy ounce. On February 24, 2016, the closing price of gold was $1,250.75 per troy ounce.

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have approximately 165 employees, including six in Golden, approximately 129 in Torre&#243;n, Mexico or at the Velarde&#241;a Properties (including approximately 71 assigned to the oxide plant which is leased to a third party), three in Argentina in connection with the El Quevar project, and approximately 27 in various foreign exploration offices. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

There is aggressive competition within the mining industry for the acquisition of a limited number of mineral resource opportunities, and many of the mining companies with which we compete have greater financial and technical resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, as well as on exploration and advancement of their mineral properties. We also compete with other mining companies for the acquisition and retention of skilled mining engineers, mine and processing plant operators and mechanics, geologists, geophysicists and other experienced technical personnel. Our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically advance new 

&#160; 

&#160; 

and existing silver and gold properties. Failure to achieve and maintain a competitive position could adversely impact our ability to obtain the financing necessary for us to advance our mineral properties. 

&#160;
