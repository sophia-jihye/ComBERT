 Item 1. &#160; Business 

Overview

Healthways, Inc. provides network delivered solutions and population health management services that are uniquely designed to help people improve their well-being, thereby improving their health and productivity and reducing their health-related costs. Our solutions and services are designed to improve some or all of a population's well-being elements: physical, financial, social, community and sense of purpose. In some cases we engage entire populations, including health plan memberships, workforces and communities, while in other cases we engage targeted populations such as members at high-risk, cohorts of cardiac rehabilitation patients or hospital discharge patients. In the U.S., we operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our customers include health plans, both commercial and Medicare Advantage, large self-insured employers including state and municipal government entities, and providers of healthcare, including integrated healthcare systems, and hospitals. In addition to our U.S. operations, we also provide services to commercial healthcare businesses and/or government entities in Australia, Brazil, and France.

Our Network Solutions Business contains, among others, three large programs including the SilverSneakers&#174; senior fitness program, the Prime fitness program and the Physical Medicine access program. The SilverSneakers&#174; senior fitness program is offered to members of Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, and Group Retirees. Our networks encompass approximately 16,000 U.S. fitness center locations and more than 1,000 alternative locations providing classes only. We utilize the fitness center national network to also offer the Prime Fitness program through commercial health plans, employers and insurance exchanges. We also offer a Physical Medicine network of over 88,000 complementary, alternative and physical medicine practitioners to serve individuals through health plans and employers who seek health services such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, chiropractic care, acupuncture and more.

Our Population Health Business, whose largest customers are commercial health plans and self-insured employers, takes a systematic approach to keeping healthy people healthy, eliminating or reducing lifestyle risks and optimizing care for persistent or chronic conditions. Our population health technology platform uses our proprietary analytics and predictive models to enable us to stratify the population, develop individualized well-being improvement plans and deliver targeted action-based solutions to improve individual and organizational performance. Many of our intervention services are delivered from our domestic and international well-being improvement call centers staffed with a range of health care professionals. The professionals include, but are not limited to, nurses, dieticians, pharmacists, health coaches, exercise specialists and nutritional counselors. Our interventions are delivered using a range of other methods, including venue-based face-to-face interactions; print; phone; mobile and remote devices with unique applications; on-line web-based portals , including social networks; and any combination of these methods.

&#160;

Founded and incorporated in Delaware in 1981, Healthways, Inc. is headquartered at 701 Cool Springs Boulevard, Franklin, TN 37067.

&#160;

Customer Contracts

Our fees are generally billed on a per member per month ("PMPM") basis or upon member participation, such as the SilverSneakers&#174; fitness solution. For PMPM fees, we generally determine our contract fees by multiplying the contractually negotiated PMPM rate by the number of members eligible for or receiving our services during the month. PMPM rates are established during contract negotiations with customers, often based on the value we expect our programs to create and a sharing of that value between the customer and the Company. 

Our contracts with health plans and integrated healthcare systems generally range from three to five years with several comprehensive strategic agreements extending up to ten years in length. Contracts with self-insured employers typically have two to four-year terms. Some of our contracts allow the customer to terminate early.

Some of our contracts place a portion of our fees at risk based on achieving certain performance metrics such as cost savings, and/or clinical outcomes improvements ("performance-based"). Approximately 7% of revenues recorded during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were performance-based and 2% of revenues were subject to final reconciliation as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Backlog

Backlog represents the estimated average annualized revenue at target performance over the term of the contract for business awarded but not yet started. We do not consider backlog at December 31 to be a meaningful predictor of our future revenues as a significant majority of our new revenues come from a combination of expanding revenue from existing customers and new customers with contracts that are signed and started on a non-calendar year basis. Annualized revenue in backlog as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:

Business Strategy

&#160;

Our business strategy and value proposition reflect our fundamental belief that people with higher well-being have lower overall health-related costs, improved workforce engagement and improved productivity. These outcomes create value for our customers, which include health plans, governments, employers, integrated healthcare systems and communities.

We believe the entire healthcare market is shifting to payment for outcomes, not simply volume of services or time, and that solutions focused on population health management are the most effective model within this pay-for-value reimbursement market. We believe this model is better aligned with macro healthcare trends and their impact on payors, providers and consumers.

As part of our reorganization and cost rationalization plan developed in 2015 (the "2015 Restructuring Plan"), we are moving from an organization focused on five customer end markets to a structure centered on two primary businesses &#8211; Network Solutions and Population Health Services. The Network Solutions business creates interventions that are delivered through the networks that we manage, including our SilverSneakers &#174; Fitness program and our national network of complementary and alternative medicine providers. The Population Health Services business unit delivers interventions directly to members of sponsored populations. These interventions are designed to improve people's health and well-being and drive improved performance and lower health-related costs by keeping healthy people healthy, eliminating or reducing lifestyle risks that lead to disease and optimizing care for people with persistent conditions or chronic disease.

&#160;

Strategic partnerships with leading health and well-being solutions providers are an important part of our business strategy. For example, we collaborate with Blue Zones, LLC to deliver a scaled well-being improvement solution to improve the well-being of entire community populations, and we have an exclusive partnership with Dr. Dean Ornish that is expanding access to the Dr. Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease&#8482; . 

&#160;

Delivery Model 

The degree of our engagement and model of support is based on our customers' needs and preferences. Within our Network Solutions Business, we have approximately 16,000 U.S. fitness center locations and more than 1,000 alternative locations providing classes only. We utilize the fitness center national network to deliver the SilverSneakers &#174; Fitness proprietary curriculum and also offer the Prime Fitness program. Within our Population Health Services, behavior change techniques and predictive modeling are incorporated in our technology to identify an individual's readiness to change. We then provide personalized support through appropriate interactions using a range of methods desired by an individual, including self-directed modalities of mobile, web and integrated devices including social networks; venue-based face-to-face, print, phone and others. 

Modalities used and intensity of service must deliver the expected result &#8211; healthier people who cost less and perform better. We expect to invest where appropriate in technology to refine our proprietary clinical, data management and reporting systems to continue to meet the requirements of our customers to deliver measureable outcomes.

&#160;

Measurement of Outcomes 

&#160;

Through our exclusive, 25-year relationship with Gallup which began in 2008, we have created a definitive measure and empiric database of changes in the well-being of the U.S. population based on over two million completed surveys to date, known as the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index&#174;. This database supports our understanding of the causes and effects of well-being for a population. The Gallup-Healthways individual well-being assessment tools, known collectively as the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being 5 TM , provide employers, health providers, insurers and other interested parties with a validated capability to assess, measure and report on changes in the well-being of their employees, patients, members and customers.

&#160;

Growth Strategy 

&#160;

We are engaged in a comprehensive review of the Healthways organization: our business structure, costs, product offerings and delivery. We are focused on listening to and understanding our customers' requirements and how best to meet their needs. Our objective is to be a leader in the markets in which we compete while providing a level of financial performance commensurate with that leadership position.

&#160;

The outcome of our strategic review, which we expect to continue through the first half of 2016, might include the addition or subtraction of capabilities and technologies through internal development, strategic alliances with other entities and/or selective acquisitions, divestitures or investments. 

Segment and Major Customer Information

During 2015, we had two operating segments (domestic and international) that we have aggregated into one reportable segment, well-being improvement services. During 2015, Humana, Inc. ("Humana") comprised approximately 13.1% of our revenues. Our primary contract with Humana continues through 2020. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in 2015.

&#160;

As part of the 2015 Restructuring Plan, which is planned to be completed in 2016, management is evaluating the internal structural and reporting changes necessary to begin managing our operations as two primary businesses, Network Solutions and Population Health Services. The outcome of this evaluation could impact how we report our segments in the future for financial reporting purposes. In addition, a change in segment reporting could also result in a change in our reporting units &#160; for goodwill impairment measurement purposes .

&#160;

Competition

The healthcare industry is highly competitive and subject to continual change in the manner in which services are provided. Other entities, whose financial, research, staff, and marketing resources may exceed our resources, are marketing a variety of population health management services and other services or have announced an intention to offer such services to health plans, both commercial and Medicare Advantage; large self-insured employers, including state and municipal government entities; and providers of healthcare, including integrated healthcare systems, hospitals, and physician groups. These entities include health and wellness companies, retail drug stores, major pharmaceutical companies, health plans, healthcare web-based and/or print content companies, home healthcare organizations, providers, pharmacy benefit management companies, medical device and diagnostic companies, healthcare information technology companies, Internet-based medical content companies, revenue cycle management companies, consulting firms and other entities.

We believe we have certain advantages over our competitors because of the breadth and depth of our well-being improvement capabilities, including the scope of our strategic relationships; the brand recognition of certain programs such as SilverSneakers &#174; ; state-of-the-art proprietary information technology; predictive modeling and data integration capabilities; behavior-change techniques; the comprehensive recruitment and training of our clinical colleagues; our experienced management team; the comprehensive clinical nature and evidence-based scientific foundation of our product offerings; our established reputation for providing well-being improvement services to members wishing to maintain health, who possess health risk factors or are diagnosed with chronic diseases; and the proven financial and clinical results delivered by our programs as evidenced through a library of published peer-reviewed outcomes studies. However, we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with other entities such as those noted above.

&#160;

Industry Integration and Consolidation

Consolidation remains an important factor in all aspects of the healthcare industry, including the well-being and health management sector. While we believe the size of our membership base provides us with the economies of scale to compete even in a consolidating market, we cannot assure you that we can effectively compete with companies formed as a result of industry consolidation or that we can retain existing customers if they are acquired by other entities which already have or contract for programs similar to ours or are not interested in our programs.

Consolidation may be driven, in part, by the increasing adoption of alternative payment models. For example, Accountable Care Organizations ("ACOs") promote accountability and coordination of care among providers by allowing providers, including hospitals, physicians, and other designated professionals, to voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high-quality and efficient delivery of services. Medicare-approved ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by the U.S. Department of Health &#38; Human Services ("HHS") may be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. We provide support and services for multiple ACOs that serve Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries through our partnerships with integrated health systems. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the "PPACA") also required HHS to establish voluntary national bundled payment programs under which participating groups of providers receive a single payment for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. Further, HHS has established a mandatory bundled payment program for certain hospitals participating in Medicare that perform hip and knee replacements, beginning in April 2016. While ACOs and bundled payments are Medicare programs, commercial insurers and private managed care health plans may increasingly shift to ACO and bundled payment models as well. We expect these and other changes resulting from PPACA to further encourage integration and increase consolidation in the healthcare industry.

Governmental Regulation

&#160;

Governmental regulation impacts us in a number of ways in addition to those regulatory risks presented under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" below.

&#160;

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA")

The PPACA changes how healthcare services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through, among other things, significant reductions in the growth of Medicare program payments. In addition, PPACA reforms certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. PPACA contains provisions that have, and will continue to have, an impact on our customers, including commercial health plans and Medicare Advantage programs. 

&#160;

Among other things, PPACA decreases the number of uninsured individuals and expands coverage through the expansion of public programs and private sector health insurance as well as a number of health insurance market reforms. In addition, PPACA encourages the utilization of preventive services and wellness programs, such as those we provide. However, PPACA also directly affects the customers or prospective customers that contract for our services and may increase their costs and/or reduce their revenues. For example, PPACA prohibits commercial health plans from using gender, health status, family history, or occupation to set premium rates, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions, and bans annual benefit limits. In addition, PPACA mandates minimum medical loss ratios ("MLRs") for health plans such that the percentage of health coverage premium revenue spent on healthcare medical costs and quality improvement expenses be at least 80% for individual and small group health plans and 85% for large group coverage and Medicare Advantage plans, with policyholders receiving rebates, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") receiving refunds in the case of Medicare Advantage plans, if the actual loss ratios fall below these minimums. 

Changes in laws governing reimbursement to health plans providing services under governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid may affect us. PPACA impacts Medicare Advantage programs in a variety of ways. PPACA reduces premium payments to Medicare Advantage plans such that the managed care per capita payments paid by CMS to Medicare Advantage plans are, on average, equal to those for traditional Medicare. While PPACA awards bonuses to Medicare Advantage plans that achieve service benchmarks and quality ratings, overall payments to Medicare Advantage plans are significantly reduced under PPACA. The impact of these reductions on our business is not yet clear.

It is difficult to predict with any reasonable certainty the full impact of PPACA on the Company due to the law's complexity, lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation, remaining or new court challenges, and possible amendment or repeal.

Other Laws

While many of the governmental and regulatory requirements affecting healthcare delivery generally do not directly apply to us, our customers must comply with a variety of regulations including those governing Medicare Advantage plans and their marketing, the licensing and reimbursement requirements of federal, state and local agencies and the requirements of municipal building codes and health codes. Certain of our services, including health service utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure by government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses.

Certain of our professional healthcare employees, such as nurses, must comply with individual licensing requirements. All of our healthcare professionals who are subject to licensing requirements are licensed in the state in which they are physically present, such as the professionals located at a well-being improvement call center. Multiple state licensing requirements for healthcare professionals who provide services telephonically over state lines may require some of our healthcare professionals to be licensed in more than one state. We continually monitor legislative, regulatory and judicial developments in telemedicine in order to stay in compliance with state and federal laws; however, new agency interpretations, federal or state legislation or regulations, or judicial decisions could increase the requirement for multi-state licensing of all well-being improvement call center health professionals, which would increase our costs of services.

&#160;

Federal privacy regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") extensively restrict the use and disclosure of individually-identifiable health information by health plans, most healthcare providers, and certain other entities (collectively, "covered entities"). Federal security regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA require covered entities to implement and maintain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic individually-identifiable health information. Because we handle individually-identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities, we are considered a "business associate" and are required to comply with most aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations.

&#160;

Violations of HIPAA and its implementing regulations may result in criminal penalties and in civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. In addition, we may be contractually or directly obligated to comply with any applicable state laws or regulations related to the confidentiality and security of confidential personal information. In the event of a data breach involving individually-identifiable health information, we are subject to contractual obligations and state and federal requirements that require us to notify our customers. These requirements may also require us or our customers to notify affected individuals, regulatory agencies, and the media of the data breach. In addition, non-permitted uses and disclosures of unsecured individually identifiable health information are presumed to be breaches for which notice is required, unless it can be demonstrated that there is a low probability the information has been compromised.

Federal law contains various prohibitions related to false statements and false claims, some of which apply to private payors as well as federal programs. Actions may be brought under the federal False Claims Act by the government as well as by private individuals, known as "whistleblowers," who are permitted to share in any settlement or judgment.

There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act, including knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment. Liability under the False Claims Act also arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government, and the False Claims Act defines the term "knowingly" broadly. The Health Reform Law provides that submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of certain "fraud and abuse" provisions of the Social Security Act, including the anti-kickback provisions, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government, and some courts have taken the position that entities that allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the federal self-referral prohibition commonly known as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the False Claims Act. From time to time, participants in the healthcare industry, including our company and our customers, may be subject to actions under the False Claims Act, and it is not possible to predict the impact of such actions.

&#160;

Because of our international operations, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provide services. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties.

&#160;

Employees

As of February 1, 2016, we had approximately 2,400 employees. Our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have good relationships with our employees.
