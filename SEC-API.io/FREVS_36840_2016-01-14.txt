 ITEM 1 BUSINESS &#160;

(a) General Business First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey (&#8220;FREIT&#8221;) is an equity real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) organized in New Jersey in 1961. FREIT acquires, develops, constructs and holds real estate properties for long-term investment and not for resale.

FREIT&#8217;s long-range investment policy is to review and evaluate potential real estate investment opportunities for acquisition that it believes will (i) complement its existing investment portfolio, (ii) generate increased income and distributions to its shareholders, and (iii) increase the overall value of FREIT&#8217;s portfolio. FREIT&#8217;s investments may take the form of wholly-owned fee interests, or if the circumstances warrant diversification of risk, ownership on a joint venture basis with other parties, including employees and affiliates of Hekemian &#38; Co., Inc., FREIT&#8217;s managing agent (&#8220;Hekemian&#8221;) (See &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;), provided FREIT is able to maintain management control over the property. While our general investment policy is to hold and maintain properties for the long-term, we may, from time-to-time, sell or trade certain properties in order to (i) obtain capital to be used to purchase, develop or renovate other properties which we believe will provide a higher rate of return and increase the value of our investment portfolio, and (ii) divest properties which we have determined or determine are no longer compatible with our growth strategies and investment objectives for our real estate portfolio.

Fiscal Year 2015 Developments 

(i) FINANCING (a) On December 9, 2013, Grande Rotunda, LLC closed with Wells Fargo Bank on a construction loan of up to $120 million to be used to reconfigure and expand its Rotunda property in Baltimore, Maryland. As of October 31, 2015, $92 million was drawn on the construction line with Wells Fargo Bank, of which $19 million was used to pay off the loan from FREIT, and $73 million was used towards the construction at the Rotunda. (See Notes 5 and 9 to FREIT&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.) (b) FREIT has a $12.8 million line of credit provided by the Provident Bank. The line of credit is for a two year term ending on November 1, 2016, but can be cancelled by the bank, at its will, within 60 days before or after each anniversary date. The credit line will automatically be extended at the termination date of the current term and each subsequent term for an additional period of 24 months, provided there is no default and the credit line has not been cancelled. Draws against the credit line can be used for general corporate purposes, for property acquisitions, construction activities, and letters of credit. The interest rate on the line of credit has a floor of 3.25%. The $5 million that was outstanding as of October 31, 2014, was repaid to the bank in January 2015. As of October 31, 2015, approximately $12.8 million was available under the line of credit, and no amount was outstanding. (See Note 5 to FREIT&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.) 3&#160;

&#160;

(c) On December 29, 2014, FREIT Regency, LLC closed on a $16.2 million mortgage loan with the Provident Bank. The new loan bears a floating interest rate equal to 125 basis points over the BBA LIBOR and the loan will mature on December 15, 2024. In order to minimize interest rate volatility during the term of the loan, FREIT Regency, LLC entered into an interest rate swap agreement that in effect, converted the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 3.75% over the term of the loan. Proceeds from the loan were used to pay off the $5 million outstanding balance on FREIT&#8217;s credit line, and the remainder of the proceeds will be available to fund future capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. (ii) CONSTRUCTION 

The Rotunda property in Baltimore, MD (owned by FREIT&#8217;s 60% owned affiliate Grande Rotunda, LLC) is an 11.5 acre site containing 138,000 sq. ft. office building and approximately 78,000 sq. ft. of retail space on the lower level of the office building. This property is currently being redeveloped and expanded. The redevelopment and expansion plans include a modernization of the office building and smaller adjacent buildings, construction of 379 residential apartment rental units, an additional 75,000 square feet of new retail space, and 864 above level parking spaces. On December 9, 2013, Grande Rotunda, LLC closed with Wells Fargo Bank on a construction loan of up to $120 million to be used to reconfigure and expand its Rotunda property. The construction loan is for a term of four (4) years, with one 12-month extension, at a rate of 225 basis points over the monthly LIBOR. FREIT started construction in September 2013, and is moving forward toward the completion of this construction project.

(iii) PLANNED DISPOSITIONS &#38; ACQUISITIONS There were no planned dispositions or acquisitions in fiscal 2015.

On January 11, 2016, FREIT was notified by Lakeland Bank (as successor by merger to Pascack Community Bank) of its election and exercise of the option to purchase the property leased by FREIT to Lakeland Bank located in Rochelle Park, New Jersey having a carrying value of $2,273,000 at October 31, 2015. Pursuant to the Lease Agreement, Lakeland Bank has the right to exercise this option at a price equal to the greater of $3 million or the fair market value of the property as determined by mutual agreement between tenant and landlord. The gain from the sale of this property cannot be determined until the purchase price is determined. However, the sale will result in FREIT&#8217;s loss of annual rents of approximately $241,000.

(b) Financial Information about Segments FREIT has two reportable segments: Commercial Properties and Residential Properties. These reportable segments have different types of tenants and are managed separately because each requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Segment information for the three years ended October 31, 2015 is included in Note 14 &#8220;Segment Information&#8221; to FREIT&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

(c) Narrative Description of Business FREIT was founded and organized for the principal purpose of acquiring, developing, and owning a portfolio of diverse income producing real estate properties. FREIT&#8217;s developed properties include residential apartment communities and commercial properties that consist of multi and single tenanted properties. Our properties are located in New Jersey, Maryland and New York. We also currently own approximately 7.37 acres of unimproved land in New Jersey. See Item 2, &#8220;Properties - Portfolio of Investments.&#8221; &#160;

FREIT elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. FREIT operates in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT in order to take advantage of certain favorable tax aspects of the REIT structure. Generally, a REIT will not be subject to federal income taxes on that portion of its ordinary income or capital gain that is currently distributed to its equity holders.

As an equity REIT, we generally acquire interests in income producing properties to be held as long-term investments. FREIT&#8217;s return on such investments is based on the income generated by such properties mainly in the form of rents.

From time to time, FREIT has sold, and may sell again in the future, certain of its properties in order to (i) obtain capital used or to be used to purchase, develop or renovate other properties which we believe will provide a higher rate of return and increase the value of our investment portfolio, and (ii) divest properties which FREIT has determined or determines are no longer compatible with our growth strategies and investment objectives for our real estate portfolio.

We do not hold any patents, registered trademarks, or licenses. &#160;

Portfolio of Real Estate Investments 

At October 31, 2015, FREIT&#8217;s real estate holdings included (i) seven (7) apartment buildings or complexes containing a total of 1,093 rentable units, (ii) ten (10) commercial properties (retail and office) containing approximately 1,265,000 square feet of leasable space, including one (1) single tenant store, two (2) separate one acre parcels subject to ground leases, and (iii) three (3) parcels of undeveloped land consisting of approximately 7.37 acres in total. FREIT and its subsidiaries own all such properties in fee simple. See Item 2, &#8220;Properties - Portfolio of Investments&#8221; of this Annual Report for a description of FREIT&#8217;s separate investment properties and certain other pertinent information with respect to such properties that is relevant to FREIT&#8217;s business.

Employees 

On October 31, 2015, FREIT and its subsidiaries had twenty seven (27) full-time employees and seven (7) part-time employees who work solely at the properties owned by FREIT or its subsidiaries. The number of part-time employees varies seasonally.

Mr. Robert S. Hekemian, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Donald W. Barney, President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. John A. Aiello, Esq., Secretary and Executive Secretary, are the executive officers of FREIT. Mr. Hekemian devotes approximately seventy percent (70%) of his business activities to FREIT, Mr. Barney devotes approximately fifteen percent (15%) of his business activities to FREIT, and Mr. Aiello devotes approximately ten percent (10%) of his business activities to FREIT. Refer to &#8220;Item 10 &#8211; Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.&#8221; Hekemian has been retained by FREIT to manage FREIT&#8217;s properties and is responsible for recruiting, on behalf of FREIT, the personnel required to perform all services related to the operation of FREIT&#8217;s properties. See &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221; below. &#160;

Management Agreement 

On April 10, 2002, FREIT and Hekemian &#38; Co. Inc. (&#8220;Hekemian&#8221;) executed a Management Agreement whereby Hekemian would continue as Managing Agent for FREIT. The term of the Management Agreement was renewed on November 1, 2015 for a two-year term which will expire on October 31, 2017. The Management Agreement automatically renews for successive periods of two years unless either party gives not less than six (6) months prior notice to the other of non-renewal. Hekemian currently manages all the properties owned by FREIT and its affiliates, except for the office building at the Rotunda located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is managed by an independent third party management company. However, FREIT may retain other managing agents to manage properties acquired after April 10, 2002 and to perform various other duties such as sales, acquisitions, and development with respect to any or all properties. Hekemian does not serve as the exclusive property acquisition advisor to FREIT and is not required to offer potential acquisition properties exclusively to FREIT before acquiring those properties for its own account. The Management Agreement includes a detailed schedule of fees for those services, which Hekemian may be called upon to perform. The Management Agreement provides for a termination fee in the event of a termination or non-renewal of the Management Agreement under certain circumstances.

Pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, FREIT pays Hekemian certain fees and commissions as compensation for its services. From time to time, FREIT engages Hekemian to provide certain additional services, such as consulting services related to development, property sales and financing activities of FREIT. Separate fee arrangements are negotiated between Hekemian and FREIT with respect to such additional services. In Fiscal 2007, FREIT&#8217;s Board of Trustees approved and FREIT executed a development fee agreement for the Rotunda redevelopment project for the development services to be provided by Hekemian Development Resources LLC (&#8220;Resources&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hekemian. The development fee agreement, as amended, for the Rotunda provides for Resources to receive a fee equal to 6.375% of the development costs as defined, less the amount of $3 million previously paid to Hekemian for the Rotunda project. In addition, the Board approved the payment of a fee to Resources in the amount of $1.4 million in connection with the revision to the scope of the Rotunda development project. The fee will be paid to Resources upon the following terms: (i) $500,000 of the $1.4 million will be paid on a monthly basis during the design phase (the $500,000 was paid in Fiscal 2013); and (ii) $900,000 of the $1.4 million will be paid upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the multi-family portion of the project. The minority ownership interest of Grande Rotunda, LLC is owned by Rotunda 100, LLC, which is principally owned by employees of Hekemian, including certain members of the immediate family of Robert S. Hekemian, FREIT&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Robert S. Hekemian, Jr., a trustee of FREIT, and the members of the Hekemian family have majority management control of these entities. (See Note 9 to FREIT&#8217;s consolidated financial statements . )

5&#160;

&#160;

Mr. Robert S. Hekemian, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and a Trustee of FREIT, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Hekemian. Mr. Hekemian owns approximately 0.2% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Hekemian. Mr. Robert S. Hekemian, Jr, a Trustee of FREIT, is the President of Hekemian, and owns approximately 33.3% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Hekemian.

Real Estate Financing 

FREIT funds acquisition opportunities and the development of its real estate properties largely through debt financing, including mortgage loans against certain of its properties. At October 31, 2015, FREIT&#8217;s aggregate outstanding mortgage debt was $307.9 million with an average interest cost on a weighted average basis of 4.26%. FREIT has mortgage loans against certain properties which serve as collateral for such loans. See the tables in Item 2, &#8220;Properties - Portfolio of Investments&#8221; for the outstanding mortgage balances at October 31, 2015 with respect to each of these properties.

FREIT is highly leveraged and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. This level of indebtedness presents an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of FREIT. A number of FREIT&#8217;s mortgage loans are being amortized over a period that is longer than the terms of such loans; thereby requiring balloon payments at the expiration of the terms of such loans. FREIT has not established a cash reserve sinking fund with respect to such obligations and at this time does not expect to have sufficient funds from operations to make such balloon payments when due under the terms of such loans . See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; under Item 7 . 

FREIT is subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that FREIT&#8217;s cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; the risk that indebtedness on its properties will not be able to be renewed, repaid or refinanced when due; or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the indebtedness being replaced. If FREIT were unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, FREIT might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to FREIT. These losses could have a material adverse effect on FREIT and its ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on its debt. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and FREIT is unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of revenues and asset value to FREIT. Further, payment obligations on FREIT&#8217;s mortgage loans will not be reduced if there is a decline in the economic performance of any of FREIT&#8217;s properties. If any such decline in economic performance occurs, FREIT&#8217;s revenues, earnings, and funds available for distribution to shareholders would be adversely affected.

Neither FREIT&#8217;s Declaration of Trust nor any policy statement formally adopted by the Board limits either the total amount of indebtedness or the specified percentage of indebtedness (based on the total capitalization of FREIT), which may be incurred by FREIT. Accordingly, FREIT may incur in the future additional secured or unsecured indebtedness in furtherance of its business activities, including, if or when necessary, to refinance its existing debt. Future debt incurred by FREIT could bear interest at rates which are higher than the rates on FREIT&#8217;s existing debt. Future debt incurred by FREIT could also bear interest at a variable rate. Increases in interest rates would increase FREIT&#8217;s variable interest costs (to the extent that the related indebtedness was not protected by interest rate protection arrangements), which could have a material adverse effect on FREIT and its ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on its debt or cause FREIT to be in default under its debt. Further, in the future, FREIT may not be able to, or may determine that it is not able to, obtain financing for property acquisitions or for capital expenditures to develop or improve its properties on terms which are acceptable to FREIT. In such event, FREIT might elect to defer certain projects unless alternative sources of capital were available, such as through an equity or debt offering by FREIT.

Competitive Conditions 

FREIT is subject to normal competition with other investors to acquire real property and to profitably manage such property. Numerous other REITs, banks, insurance companies and pension funds, as well as corporate and individual developers and owners of real estate, compete with FREIT in seeking properties for acquisition and for tenants. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources than FREIT.

In addition, retailers at FREIT's commercial properties face increasing competition from discount shopping centers, outlet malls, sales through catalogue offerings, discount shopping clubs, marketing and shopping through cable and computer sources, particularly over the internet, and telemarketing. In many markets, the trade areas of FREIT's commercial properties overlap with the trade areas of other shopping centers. Renovations and expansions at those competing shopping centers and malls could negatively affect FREIT's commercial properties by encouraging shoppers to make their purchases at such new, expanded or renovated shopping centers and malls. Increased competition through these various sources could adversely affect the viability of FREIT's tenants, and any new commercial real estate competition developed in the future could potentially have an adverse effect on the revenues of and earnings from FREIT's commercial properties.

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160; (A) General Factors Affecting Investment in Commercial and Apartment Properties; Effect of Economic and Real Estate Conditions The revenues and value of FREIT&#8217;s commercial and residential apartment properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation, the national economic climate; the regional economic climate (which may be adversely affected by plant closings, industry slow-downs and other local business factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of retail space or apartment units); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the security, safety, convenience and attractiveness of a shopping center; perception by residential tenants of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of an apartment building or complex; the proximity and the number of competing shopping centers and apartment complexes; the availability of recreational and other amenities and the willingness and ability of the owner to provide capable management and adequate maintenance. In addition, other factors may adversely affect the fair market value of a commercial property or apartment building or complex without necessarily affecting the revenues, including changes in government regulations (such as limitations on development or on hours of operation) changes in tax laws or rates, and potential environmental or other legal liabilities.

&#160;

&#160; (B) Commercial Shopping Center Properties' Dependence on Anchor Stores and Satellite Tenants FREIT believes that its revenues and earnings, its ability to meet its debt obligations, and its funds available for distribution to shareholders would be adversely affected if space in FREIT's multi-store shopping center properties could not be leased or if anchor store tenants or satellite tenants failed to meet their lease obligations.

The success of FREIT's investment in its shopping center properties is largely dependent upon the success of its tenants. Unfavorable economic, demographic, or competitive conditions may adversely affect the financial condition of tenants and consequently the lease revenues from and the value of FREIT's investments in its shopping center properties. If the sales of stores operating in FREIT's shopping center properties were to decline due to deteriorating economic conditions, the tenants may be unable to pay their base rents or meet other lease charges and fees due to FREIT. In addition, any lease provisions providing for additional rent based on a percentage of sales would not be operative in this economic environment. In the event of default by a tenant, FREIT could suffer a loss of rent and experience extraordinary delays while incurring additional costs in enforcing its rights under the lease, which FREIT may not be able to recapture.

As at October 31, 2015, the following table lists the ten (10) largest commercial tenants, which account for approximately 57.2% of FREIT&#8217;s leased commercial rental space and 38.9% of fixed commercial rents.

(a) The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and its affiliates, including Pathmark Stores, Inc. (&#34;A&#38;P&#34;), filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code as disclosed in the bankruptcy filings. On December 23, 2015, FREIT was notified by A&#38;P that this lease would be rejected as of December 31, 2015. See &#8220;Renewal of Leases and Reletting of Space&#8221; below and &#8220;Results of Operations &#8211; Segment Information &#8211; Commercial Segment&#8221; under Item 7 for further information. See also Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; (C) Renewal of Leases and Reletting of Space There is no assurance that we will be able to retain tenants at our commercial properties upon expiration of their leases. Upon expiration or termination of leases for space located in FREIT's commercial properties, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting (including the cost of concessions to tenants) may not be as favorable as lease terms for the terminated lease. If FREIT were unable to promptly relet all or a substantial portion of this space or if the rental rates upon such reletting were significantly lower than current or expected rates, FREIT's revenues and earnings, FREIT&#8217;s ability to service its debt, and FREIT&#8217;s ability to make expected distributions to its shareholders, could be adversely affected.

7&#160;

&#160;

The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and its affiliates, including Pathmark Stores, Inc. (&#8220;A&#38;P&#8221;), filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code as disclosed in the bankruptcy filings. On December 23, 2015, FREIT was notified by A&#38;P that Pathmark&#8217;s lease of FREIT&#8217;s Patchogue, New York property would be rejected as of December 31, 2015. FREIT has recorded an expense in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2015 of $1,046,000 ($0.15 per share basic and diluted) for provision for loss related to the straight line rent receivable for Pathmark. The provision has no impact on cash flow or funds from operations. However, as a result of the lease being rejected, FREIT will lose annual rents of approximately $1.4 million until the store is re-leased. See &#8220;Results of Operations &#8211; Segment Information &#8211; Commercial Segment&#8221; under Item 7 for further information

On February 3, 2012, Grande Rotunda, LLC, entered into a lease termination agreement (&#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Giant, the tenant and operator of the 35,994 sq. ft. Giant supermarket at the Rotunda. Under the terms of the Agreement, Giant agreed to (i) waive its right to extend the term of the lease through March 31, 2035, (ii) terminate the lease and surrender the premises to Grande Rotunda, LLC no later than the earlier of commencement of the redevelopment of the property or March 31, 2015, and (iii) notwithstanding any earlier termination date, continue to pay monthly fixed rent payments plus its share of common area maintenance charges and taxes for the Rotunda property through March 31, 2015. Grande Rotunda, LLC has agreed (i) not to lease more than 20,000 sq. ft. of any space in the property for use as a food supermarket through March 31, 2035, and (ii) if Grande Rotunda, LLC decides to lease such space for use as a food supermarket, it must first offer Giant the space for the same use under terms acceptable to Grande Rotunda, LLC and Giant will have thirty days to accept the offer before the space may be leased to a third party. In November 2013, FREIT entered into a lease agreement with Mom&#8217;s Organic Market Inc., for approximately 14,300 square feet which was subsequently expanded in March 2014 by approximately 3,250 square feet. In accordance with the agreement Grande Rotunda, LLC has with Giant, Grande Rotunda, LLC first offered the lease of this space to Giant which declined the offer.

During Fiscal 2011, FREIT was notified by the former tenant and operator of the 55,330 sq. ft. Giant Supermarket at the Westridge Square shopping center that it would not extend the term of its lease, which expired on October 31, 2011. On July 27, 2012, FREIT signed a lease agreement with G-Mart Frederick, Inc., the operator of an international grocery store chain (&#8220;G-Mart&#8221;), for a significant portion (40,000 square feet) of the space previously occupied by Giant. G-Mart opened for business at the center in September 2013. However, effective November 1, 2014, G-Mart notified FREIT that it had vacated its space at the Westridge Square shopping center and would be terminating its lease. A new lease for this 40,000 square foot space was signed by H-Mart, an international grocery store chain, in November 2014 and subsequently H-Mart expanded its space by an additional 15,300 square feet. H-Mart is currently renovating its space but began paying rent in May 2015. All of the tenant improvements related to G-Mart will be utilized for H-Mart.

There were no other material lease expirations during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014. There are no additional material lease expirations expected during Fiscal 2016.

&#160; (D) Illiquidity of Real Estate Investments; Possibility that Value of FREIT's Interests may be less than its Investment Equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Accordingly, the ability of FREIT to vary its portfolio in response to changing economic, market or other conditions is limited. Also, FREIT's interests in its partially owned subsidiaries are subject to transfer constraints imposed by the operating agreements which govern FREIT&#8217;s investment in these partially owned subsidiaries. Even without such restrictions on the transfer of its interests, FREIT believes that there would be a limited market for its interests in these partially owned subsidiaries.

If FREIT had to liquidate all or substantially all of its real estate holdings, the value of such assets would likely be diminished if a sale were required to be completed in a limited time frame. The proceeds to FREIT from any such sale of the assets in FREIT&#8217;s real estate portfolio might be less than the fair market value of those assets.

Impact of Governmental Laws and Regulations on Registrant's Business 

FREIT&#8217;s properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to the environment and local rent control and zoning ordinances.

&#160; (A) Environmental Matters Both federal and state governments are concerned with the impact of real estate construction and development programs upon the environment. Environmental legislation affects the cost of selling real estate, the cost to develop real estate, and the risks associated with purchasing real estate.

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owners knew of, or were responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. Such liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of any operator of, or tenant at, the property. The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal injury or property damages and the property owner's liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. If FREIT incurred any such liability, it could reduce FREIT's revenues and ability to make distributions to its shareholders.

A property can also be negatively impacted by either physical contamination or by virtue of an adverse effect upon value attributable to the migration of hazardous or toxic substances, or other contaminants that have or may have emanated from other properties.

At this time, FREIT is aware of the following environmental matters affecting its properties:

&#160; (i) Westwood Plaza Shopping Center, Westwood, NJ This property is in a Flood Hazard Zone. FREIT maintains flood insurance in the amount of $500,000 for the subject property, which is the maximum available under the Flood Program for the property. Any reconstruction of that portion of the property situated in the flood hazard zone is subject to regulations promulgated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (&#34;NJDEP&#34;), which could require extraordinary construction methods.

&#160; (ii) Franklin Crossing, Franklin Lakes, NJ The redeveloped Franklin Crossing shopping center was completed during the summer of 1997. Also in 1997, a historical discharge of hazardous materials was discovered at Franklin Crossing. The discharge was reported to the NJDEP in accordance with applicable regulations. FREIT completed the remediation required by the NJDEP.

In November 1999, FREIT received a No Further Action Letter from the NJDEP concerning the contaminated soil at Franklin Crossing. Monitoring of the groundwater will continue pursuant to a memorandum of agreement filed with the NJDEP.

&#160; (iii) Preakness Shopping Center, Wayne, NJ Prior to its purchase, in November 2002 by Wayne PSC, a Phase I and Phase II Environmental Assessment of the Preakness shopping center revealed soil and ground water contamination with Percloroethylene (Dry Cleaning Fluid) caused by the mishandling of this chemical by a former dry cleaner tenant. The seller of the center to Wayne PSC has paid for and completed all required remediation work in accordance with the NJDEP standards, and this matter is now closed.

&#160; (iv) Other a) The State of New Jersey has adopted an underground fuel storage tank law and various regulations with respect to underground storage tanks.

FREIT no longer has underground storage tanks on any of its properties.

In prior years, FREIT conducted environmental audits for all of its properties except for its undeveloped land and retail properties in Franklin Lakes (Franklin Crossing) and Glen Rock, New Jersey. Except as noted in subparagraph (iii) above, the environmental reports secured by FREIT have not revealed any environmental conditions on its properties, which require remediation pursuant to any applicable federal or state law or regulation.

b) FREIT has determined that several of its properties contain lead based paint (&#8220;LBP&#8221;). FREIT believes that it complies with all federal, state and local requirements as they pertain to LBP.

FREIT does not believe that the environmental conditions described in subparagraphs (i) - (iv) above will have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, revenues, earnings, financial condition or competitive position of FREIT.

&#160; (B) Rent Control Ordinances Each of the apartment buildings or complexes owned by FREIT is subject to some form of rent control ordinance which limits the amount by which FREIT can increase the rent for renewed leases, and in some cases, limits the amount of rent which FREIT can charge for vacated units, except for Westwood Hills and The Boulders at Rockaway which are not subject to any rent control law or regulation.

&#160; (C) Zoning Ordinances Local zoning ordinances may prevent FREIT from renovating, expanding or converting its existing properties for their highest and best use as determined by the Board.

&#160; (D) Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sale FREIT does not engage in operations in foreign countries and it does not derive any portion of its revenues from customers in foreign countries.
