 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Anavex Life Sciences Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of differentiated therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases including drug candidates to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, other central nervous system (&#8220;CNS&#8221;) diseases, pain and various types of cancer. The Company&#8217;s lead compound ANAVEX TM 2-73 is being developed to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and potentially other central nervous system diseases, including rare diseases, such as Rett syndrome.

&#160;

In November 2016, a Phase 2a clinical trial going over 52 weeks was completed for ANAVEX TM 2-73 in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer&#8217;s patients. This open-label randomized trial met both primary and secondary endpoints, and was designed to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX TM 2-73 in 32 patients. ANAVEX TM 2-73 targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, which have been shown in preclinical studies to reduce stress levels in the brain believed to restore cellular homeostasis and to reverse the pathological hallmarks observed in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. ANAVEX TM 2-73 showed no serious adverse events in a previously performed Phase 1 study. In pre-clinical studies, ANAVEX TM 2-73 demonstrated anti-amnesic and neuroprotective properties in various animal models including the transgenic mouse model Tg2576. In March 2016, we received approval from the Ethics Committee in Australia to extend the ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial, which had been requested by patients and their caregivers. The trial extension allows participants who complete 52 weeks in PART B to roll-over into a new trial and continue taking ANAVEX TM 2-73 for an additional 104 weeks, providing an opportunity to gather extended safety data. The trial is independent of the Company&#8217;s planned larger Phase 2/3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ANAVEX TM 2-73 in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. 

&#160;

In February 2016, the Company presented positive preclinical data for ANAVEX TM 2-73 in Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disease indication. The study was funded by the Rettsyndrome.org foundation.

&#160;

In September 2016, the Company presented positive preclinical data for ANAVEX TM 2-73 in Parkinson&#8217;s disease, which demonstrated significant improvements on all measures: behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. The study was funded by the Michael J Fox Foundation (&#8220;MJFF&#8221;).

&#160;

We intend to identify and initiate discussions with potential commercial partners within the next 12 months. Further, we may acquire or develop new intellectual property and assign, license, or otherwise transfer our intellectual property to further our goals.

&#160;

Effective October 7, 2015, the Company effected a reverse stock split on the basis of 1:4. As such, the Company&#8217;s authorized capital was decreased from 400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and all shares of common stock issued and outstanding were decreased on the basis of one new share for each four old shares.

&#160;

Our Pipeline 

&#160;

Our research and development pipeline includes one clinical drug candidate and several compounds in different stages of pre-clinical study.

&#160;

Our proprietary SIGMACEPTOR&#8482; Discovery Platform produced small molecule drug candidates with unique modes of action, based on our understanding of sigma receptors. Sigma receptors may be targets for therapeutics to combat many human diseases, both of neurodegenerative nature, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, as well as of neurodevelopmental nature, like Rett syndrome, a rare disease. When bound by the appropriate ligands, sigma receptors influence the functioning of multiple biochemical signals that are involved in the pathogenesis (origin or development) of disease.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Compounds that have been subjects of our research include the following:

&#160;

ANAVEX TM 2-73 

&#160; 

ANAVEX TM 2-73 may offer a disease-modifying approach in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) by using ligands that activate sigma-1 receptors.

&#160;

In AD animal models, ANAVEX TM 2-73 has shown pharmacological, histological and behavioral evidence as a potential neuroprotective, anti-amnesic, anti-convulsive and anti-depressive therapeutic agent, due to its potent affinity to sigma-1 receptors and moderate affinities to M1-4 type muscarinic receptors. In addition, ANAVEX TM 2-73 has shown a potential dual mechanism which may impact both amyloid and tau pathology. In a transgenic AD animal model Tg2576 ANAVEX TM 2-73 induced a statistically significant neuroprotective effect against the development of oxidative stress in the mouse brain, as well as significantly increased the expression of functional and synaptic plasticity markers that is apparently amyloid-beta independent. It also statistically alleviated the learning and memory deficits developed over time in the animals, regardless of sex, both in terms of spatial working memory and long-term spatial reference memory.

&#160;

Based on the results of pre-clinical testing, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial of ANAVEX TM 2-73 in 2011. In this Phase 1 SAD trial, the maximum tolerated single dose was defined per protocol as 55-60 mg. This dose is above the equivalent dose shown to have positive effects in mouse models of AD. There were no significant changes in laboratory or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. ANAVEX TM 2-73 was well tolerated below the 55-60 mg dose with only mild adverse events in some subjects. Observed adverse events at doses above the maximum tolerated single dose included headache and dizziness, which were moderate in severity and reversible. These side effects are often seen with drugs that target CNS conditions, including AD.

&#160;

The ANAVEX TM 2-73 Phase 1 SAD trial was conducted as a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Healthy male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 received single, ascending oral doses over the course of the trial. Study endpoints included safety and tolerability together with pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetics includes the absorption and distribution of a drug, the rate at which a drug enters the blood and the duration of its effect, as well as chemical changes of the substance in the body. This study was conducted in Germany in collaboration with ABX-CRO, a clinical research organization that has conducted several Alzheimer&#8217;s disease studies, and the Technical University of Dresden.

&#160;

In December 2014, a Phase 2a clinical trial was initiated for ANAVEX 2-73 TM , which is being evaluated for the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. The open-label randomized trial is designed to assess the safety and exploratory efficacy of ANAVEX TM 2-73 in 32 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. ANAVEX TM 2-73 targets sigma-1 and muscarinic receptors, which have been shown in preclinical studies to reduce stress levels in the brain believed to restore cellular homeostasis and to reverse the pathological hallmarks observed in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. ANAVEX TM 2-73 showed no serious adverse events in a previously performed Phase 1 study. In pre-clinical studies ANAVEX TM 2-73 demonstrated anti-amnesic and neuroprotective properties in various animal models including the transgenic mouse model Tg2576. 

&#160;

The Phase 2a study met both primary and secondary objectives of the study. The 31-week preliminary exploratory safety and efficacy data from the ongoing Phase 2a study of ANAVEX TM 2-73 in Alzheimer&#8217;s patients, with most receiving also donepezil, the current standard of care, demonstrated favorable safety, maximum tolerated dose, positive dose response, sustained efficacy response through 31 weeks for both cognitive and functional measures, as well as positive unexpected therapeutic response events. ANAVEX TM 2-73 continues to demonstrate a favorable adverse event (AE) profile through 31 weeks in a patient population of elderly Alzheimer&#8217;s patients with varying degrees of physical fragility. The most common side effects across all AE categories tended to be of mild severity grade 1, and were resolved with dose reductions that were anticipated within the adaptive design of the study protocol.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

At 41 weeks, Alzheimer&#8217;s patients taking a daily oral dose of ANAVEX TM 2-73 in the exploratory, not yet dose optimized Phase 2a clinical trial, showed a stabilization of cognitive and functional measures. This data of stabilization is promising since Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is a progressive disease where current therapeutics are only able to temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and not stop the disease from progressing. At 41 weeks, oral daily dosing between 10mg and 50mg, ANAVEX TM 2-73 was well tolerated, and no patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. There were no clinically significant treatment-related adverse events, and no serious adverse events.

&#160;

Pre-specified exploratory analyses included the cognitive (MMSE) and the functional (ADCS-ADL) changes from baseline. A continued stabilization of both cognitive (MMSE) and functional (ADCS-ADL) measures in patients treated with ANAVEX TM 2-73 was observed. This correlation was positive with all measured scores (MMSE, ADCS-ADL, Cogstate, HAM-D and EEG/ERP).

&#160;

ANAVEX TM 2-73 data presented meets prerequisite information in order to progress into Phase 2/3 placebo controlled studies, which is currently in the planning phase.

&#160;

Recent preclinical data validates ANAVEX TM 2-73 as a prospective platform drug for other neurodegenerative diseases beyond Alzheimer&#8217;s as well as neurodevelopmental diseases, more specifically, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, epilepsy and Rett syndrome. For Parkinson&#8217;s disease, data demonstrates significant improvements and restoration of function in a classic animal model of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Significant improvements were seen on all measures tested: behavioral, histopathological, and neuroinflammatory endpoints. For epilepsy, data demonstrates both significant and dose related improvement in the reduction of seizures, as well as significant synergy with each of three generations of epilepsy drugs currently on the market. In Rett syndrome, a rare neurodevelopmental disease indication, administration of ANAVEX TM 2-73 resulted in both significant and dose related improvements in an array of behavioral paradigms in the MECP2 HET Rett syndrome disease model.

&#160; 

ANAVEX 3-71 

&#160; 

ANAVEX 3-71, previously named AF710B is a preclinical drug candidate with a novel mechanism of action via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation, which has shown to enhance neuroprotection and cognition in Alzheimer's disease. ANAVEX 3-71 is a CNS-penetrable mono-therapy that bridges treatment of both cognitive impairments with disease modifications. It is highly effective in very small doses against the major Alzheimer's hallmarks in transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, including cognitive deficits, amyloid and tau pathologies, and also has beneficial effects on inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions. ANAVEX 3-71 indicates extensive therapeutic advantages in Alzheimer's and other protein-aggregation-related diseases given its ability to enhance neuroprotection and cognition via sigma-1 receptor activation and M1 muscarinic allosteric modulation.

&#160;

A recent preclinical study examined the response of ANAVEX 3-71 in aged transgenic animal models, and showed a significant reduction in rate of cognitive deficit, amyloid beta pathology and inflammation with the administration of ANAVEX 3-71. In April 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) granted Orphan Drug Designation (&#8220;ODD&#8221;) to ANAVEX 3-71 for the treatment of Frontotemporal dementia (&#8220;FTD&#8221;).

&#160;

ANAVEX 1-41 

&#160;

ANAVEX 1-41 is a sigma-1 agonist. Pre-clinical tests revealed significant neuroprotective benefits (i.e., protects nerve cells from degeneration or death) through the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial and oxidative stress, which damages and destroys cells and is believed by some scientists to be a primary cause of AD. In addition, in animal models, ANAVEX 1-41 prevented the expression of caspase-3, an enzyme that plays a key role in apoptosis (programmed cell death) and loss of cells in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that regulates learning, emotion and memory. These activities involve both muscarinic and sigma-1 receptor systems through a novel mechanism of action.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

ANAVEX 1037 

&#160; 

ANAVEX 1037 is designed for the treatment of prostate cancer. It is a low molecular weight, synthetic compound exhibiting high affinity for sigma-1 receptors at nanomolar levels and moderate affinity for sigma-2 receptors and sodium channels at micromolar levels. In advanced pre-clinical studies, this compound revealed antitumor potential with no toxic side effects. It has also been shown to selectively kill human cancer cells without affecting normal/healthy cells and also to significantly suppress tumor growth in immune-deficient mice models. Scientific publications describe sigma receptor ligands positively, highlighting the possibility that these ligands may stop tumor growth and induce selective cell death in various tumor cell lines. Sigma receptors are highly expressed in different tumor cell types. Binding by appropriate sigma-1 and/or sigma-2 ligands can induce selective apoptosis. In addition, through tumor cell membrane reorganization and interactions with ion channels, our drug candidates may play an important role in inhibiting the processes of metastasis (spreading of cancer cells from the original site to other parts of the body), angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) and tumor cell proliferation.

&#160;

ANAVEX 1066 

&#160;

ANAVEX 1066, a mixed sigma-1/sigma-2 ligand is designed for the potential treatment of neuropathic pain and visceral pain. ANAVEX 1066 was tested in two preclinical models of neuropathic and visceral pain that have been extensively validated in rats. In the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain, a single oral administration of ANAVEX 1066 dose-dependently restored the nociceptive threshold in the affected paw to normal levels while leaving the contralateral healthy paw unchanged. Efficacy was rapid and remained significant for two hours. In a model of visceral pain, chronic colonic hypersensitivity was induced by injection of an inflammatory agent directly into the colon and a single oral administration of ANAVEX 1066 returned the nociceptive threshold to control levels in a dose-dependent manner. Companion studies in rats demonstrated the lack of any effects on normal gastrointestinal transit with ANAVEX 1066 and a favorable safety profile in a battery of behavioral measures.

&#160;

Our compounds are in the pre-clinical and clinical testing stages of development, and there is no guarantee that the activity demonstrated in pre-clinical models will be shown in human testing.

&#160;

Our Target Indications 

&#160;

We have developed compounds with potential application to two broad categories and several specific indications. The two categories are diseases of the central nervous system, and cancer. Specific indications include:

&#160;

&#183; Alzheimer&#8217;s disease - In 2015, an estimated 5.3 million Americans were suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. The Alzheimer&#8217;s Association&#174; reports that by 2025, 7.1 million Americans will be afflicted by the disease, a 40 percent increase from currently affected patients. Medications on the market today treat only the symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and do not have the ability to stop its onset or its progression. There is an urgent and unmet need for both a disease modifying cure for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease as well as for better symptomatic treatments. &#160;

&#183; Parkinson&#8217;s disease &#8211; Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a progressive disease of the nervous system marked by tremors, muscular rigidity, and slow, imprecise movement. It is associated with degeneration of the basal ganglia of the brain and a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Parkinson&#8217;s disease afflicts more than 10 million people worldwide, typically middle-aged and elderly people. Parkinson&#8217;s disease market is set to expand from $2.1 billion in 2014 to $3.2 billion by 2021, according to business intelligence provider GBI Research. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Rett syndrome - Rett syndrome is a rare non-inherited genetic postnatal progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs almost exclusively in girls and leads to severe impairments, affecting nearly every aspect of the child&#8217;s life: their ability to speak, walk, eat, and even breathe easily. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene and strikes all racial and ethnic groups and occurs worldwide in approximately 1 in every 10,000-15,000 live female births. &#160;

&#183; Depression - Depression is a major cause of morbidity worldwide according to the World Health Organization. Pharmaceutical treatment for depression is dominated by blockbuster brands, with the leading nine brands accounting for approximately 75% of total sales. However, the dominance of the leading brands is waning, largely due to the effects of patent expiration and generic competition. &#160;

&#183; Epilepsy - Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, epilepsy affects 2.2 million Americans. Today, epilepsy is often controlled, but not cured, with medication that is categorized as older traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti epileptic drugs. Because epilepsy afflicts sufferers in different ways, there is a need for drugs used in combination with both traditional anti-epileptic drugs and second generation anti-epileptic drugs. GBI Research estimates that the epilepsy market will increase to $4.5 billion by 2019. &#160;

&#183; Neuropathic Pain &#8211; We define neuralgia, or neuropathic pain, as pain that is not related to activation of pain receptor cells in any part of the body. Neuralgia is more difficult to treat than some other types of pain because it does not respond well to normal pain medications. Special medications have become more specific to neuralgia and typically fall under the category of membrane stabilizing drugs or antidepressants. &#160;

&#183; Malignant Melanoma - Predominantly a skin cancer, malignant melanoma can also occur in melanocytes found in the bowel and the eye. Malignant melanoma accounts for 75% of all deaths associated with skin cancer. The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor, adjuvant treatment, chemo and immunotherapy, or radiation therapy. According to IMS Health the worldwide Malignant Melanoma market is expected to grow to $4.4 billion by 2022. &#160;

&#183; Prostate Cancer &#8211; Specific to men, prostate cancer is a form of cancer that develops in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. The cancer cells may metastasize from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. Drug therapeutics for Prostate Cancer are expected to increase to nearly $18.6 billion in 2017 according to BCC Research. &#160;

&#183; Pancreatic Cancer - Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the pancreas. In the United States approximately 45,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed this year and approximately 38,000 patients will die as a result of their cancer. Sales predictions by GlobalData forecast that the market for the pharmaceutical treatment of pancreatic cancer in the five largest European countries and the United States, will increase to $1.63 billion by 2017. &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive.

&#160;

At this time, we view our competition as biomedical development companies that are trying to discover and develop compounds to be used in the treatment of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and other CNS diseases, and those companies already doing so. Those companies include Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), Axovant Sciences Ltd. (NYSE: AXON), Perrigo Company Plc (NYSE:PRGO), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Allergan Plc (NYSE:AGN), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), GlaxoSmithKline Plc (NYSE:GSK), Merck &#38; Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Eli Lilly &#38; Co. (NYSE: LLY), Johnson &#38; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Roche Holding AG (VTX:ROG).

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Each of our competitors have greater capital resources, larger overall research and development staffs and facilities, and a longer history in drug discovery and development, obtaining regulatory approval, and pharmaceutical product manufacturing and marketing than we do. With these additional resources, our competitors will be able to respond to the rapid and significant technological changes in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries faster than we can. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to acquire funding for our research and development. To continue to acquire funding for our research and development, we will likely have to show progress toward our goals and we will eventually be expected to develop a compound that may result in a transaction with another pharmaceutical company.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks and Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Anavex holds ownership or exclusive rights to three issued U.S. patent and eight U.S. patent applications with various international counterpart applications, all of which relate to drug candidates and methods associated therewith. The most recent U.S. patent application was filed in November, 2016. We regard patents and other intellectual property rights as corporate assets. Accordingly, we attempt to optimize the value of intellectual property in developing our business strategy including the selective development, protection, and exploitation of our intellectual property rights.

&#160;

In addition to filings made with intellectual property organizations, we protect our intellectual property and confidential information by means of carefully considered processes of communication and the sharing of information, and by the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and provisions for the same in contractor&#8217;s agreements. While no agreement offers absolute protection, such agreements provide some form of recourse in the event of disclosure, or anticipated disclosure.

&#160;

Our intellectual property position, like that of many biomedical companies, is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved. We may file additional patent applications in the United States, or in other jurisdictions for further inventions. We may not be successful in obtaining critical claims or in protecting our potential drug compounds or processes. Even if we do obtain patents, they may not adequately protect the technology we own or have licensed. In addition, others may challenge, seek to invalidate, infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license, and rights we receive under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us. Further, the manufacture, use or sale of our potential drug compounds may infringe the patent rights of others.

&#160;

Our success will also depend in part on our ability to commercialize our compounds without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We have not conducted extensive freedom of use patent searches and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have an adverse effect on our ability to market our technology or maintain our competitive position with respect to our technology. If our compounds or other subject matter are claimed under other existing United States or other patents or are otherwise protected by third party proprietary rights, we may be subject to infringement actions. In such event, we may challenge the validity of such patents or other proprietary rights or we may be required to obtain licenses from such companies in order to develop, manufacture or market our technology. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses, if available, could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the failure to either develop a commercially viable alternative or obtain such licenses could result in delays in marketing all of our potential drug compounds based on our drug technology or the inability to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of potential drug compounds requiring such licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we defend ourselves against charges of patent infringement or to protect our proprietary rights against third parties, substantial costs will be incurred regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings are typically protracted with no certainty of success. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and force us to curtail or cease our research and development of our technology.

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Government Approval 

&#160; 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, and expected marketing of our potential drug compounds and in potential future research and development activities. The nature and extent to which such regulation will apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any potential drug compounds developed. We anticipate that all of our potential drug compounds will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization.

&#160;

In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous non-clinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. Various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, and record-keeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with the appropriate federal statutes and regulations requires substantial time and financial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approval could adversely affect the marketing of any potential drug compounds developed by us, our ability to receive product revenues, and our liquidity and capital resources.

&#160;

The steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States, which are similar to steps required in most other countries, include:

&#160;

&#183; non-clinical laboratory tests, non-clinical studies in animals, formulation studies and the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application; 

&#183; adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug; 

&#183; the submission of a new drug application or biologic license application to the FDA; and 

&#183; FDA review and approval of the new drug application or biologics license application. &#160;

Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of potential drug compound chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal studies. The results of non-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an investigational new drug application. A 30-day waiting period after the filing of each investigational new drug application is required prior to commencement of clinical testing in humans. At any time during the 30-day period or at any time thereafter, the FDA may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until the FDA authorizes trials under specified terms. The investigational new drug application process may be extremely costly and substantially delay the development of our potential drug compounds. Moreover, positive results of non-clinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in subsequent clinical trials. The FDA may require additional animal testing after an initial investigational new drug application is approved and prior to Phase III trials.

&#160;

Clinical trials to support new drug applications are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. During Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses. Phase II usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

&#160;

If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase I and II evaluations, Phase III trials are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

After successful completion of the required clinical trials, a new drug application is generally submitted. The FDA may request additional information before accepting the new drug application for filing, in which case the new drug application must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the new drug application and responds to the applicant. The FDA&#8217;s requests for additional information or clarification often significantly extends the review process. The FDA may refer the new drug application to an appropriate advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the new drug application should be approved, although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.

&#160;

Sales outside the United States of potential drug compounds we develop will also be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing for drugs. The requirements vary widely from country to country, but typically the registration and approval process takes several years and requires significant resources. In most cases, if the FDA has not approved a potential drug compound for sale in the United States, the potential drug compound may be exported for sale outside of the United States, only if it has been approved in any one of the following: the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Israel, Switzerland and South Africa. There are specific FDA regulations that govern this process.
