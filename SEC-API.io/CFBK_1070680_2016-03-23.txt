 Item 1. Business . 

General 

Central Federal Corporation (the &#8220;Holding Company&#8221;), was organized as a Delaware corporation in September 1998 as the holding company for CFBank in connection with CFBank&#8217;s conversion from a mutual to stock form of organization. As a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;). CFBank is a savings institution which was originally organized in 1892, and was formerly known as Central Federal Savings and Loan Association of Wellsville and more recently as Central Federal Bank. As used herein, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to Central Federal Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates to the contrary. 

The consolidated financial statements include Central Federal Corporation (the &#8220;Holding Company&#8221;) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, C FBank (together referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221;) . Intercompany transactions and balan c es are eliminated in co nso lidation. 

Central Federal Capital Trust I (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company, was formed in 2003 to raise additional funding for the Company. The Holding Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of this trust (variable interest entity) and, therefore, the trust is not consolidated in the Company&#8217;s financial statements, but rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability. 

Currently, the Company does not transact material business other than through CFBank. At December 31, 201 5 , the Company &#8217;s assets totaled $ 351.3 million and stockholders&#8217; equity totaled $ 38.3 million. 

CFBank is a community-oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities we serve. Our business model emphasizes personalized service, clients&#8217; access to decision makers, solution-driven lending and quick execution, efficient use of technology and the convenience of online internet banking, mobile banking, remote deposit and corporate cash management . We attract retai l and business deposits from the general public and use the deposits, together with borrowings and other funds, primarily to originate commercial and commercial real estate loans, single-family and multi-family residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit. The majority of our customers are small businesses, small business owners and consumers . 

R evenues are derived principally from the generation of interest and fees on loans originated and, to a lesser extent, interest and dividends on securities. Our &#160; primary sources of funds are retail and business deposit accounts and certificates of deposit , brokered certificates of deposit and, to a lesser extent, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances , other borrowings and proceeds from the sale of loans. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our principal market area for loans and deposits includes the following Ohio counties: Summit County through our office in Fairlawn, Ohio; Franklin County through our office in Worthington, Ohio; Columbiana County through our offices in Calcutta and Wellsville , Ohio; and Cuyahoga County, through our loan production office in Woodmere, Ohio. We originate commercial and residential real estate loans and business loans primarily throughout Ohio. &#160; 

Regulatory Order Considerations &#160; 

On May 25, 2011, the Holding Company and CFBank each consented to the issuance of an Order to Cease and Desist (the &#8220;Holding Company Order&#8221; and the &#8220;CFBank Order&#8221;, respectively, and collectively, the &#8220;Orders&#8221;) by the Office of Thrift Supervision (the &#8220;OTS&#8221;), the primary regulator of the Holding Company and CFBank at the time the Orders were issued. In July 2011, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), the FRB replaced the OTS as the primary regulator of the Holding Company and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;) replaced the OTS as the primary regulator of CFBank. See Note 2 to the C onsolidated F inancial S tatements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the Orders. 

The Orders imposed significant directives applicable to the Holding Company and CFBank, including requirements that we reduce the level of our classified and criticized assets, achieve growth and operating metrics in line with an approved business plan, and comply with restrictions on brokered deposits and on certain types of lending and prohibitions on dividends and repurchases of our capital stock. The CFBank Order required CFBank to have 8% core capital and 12% total risk-based capital, and CFBank could not be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations so long as the CFBank Order remained in place, even if it met or exceeded these capital levels. In addition, the regulators were required to approve any deviation from our business plan and certain compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the Orders. 

On August 20, 2012, the Holding Company announced the successful completion of its common stock offering , pursuant to which t he Holding Company sold 15.0 million shares of its common stock at $1.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $22.5 million before expenses. With the proceeds from the stock offering, the Holding Company contributed $13.5 million to CFBank to improve its capital ratios and support future growth and expansion, bringing CFBank into compliance with the capital ratios required by the CFBank Order. In addition, the Holding Company used proceeds from the common stock offering to redeem its TARP obligations on September 26, 2012. The remaining proceeds from the restructured registered common stock offering were retained by the Company for general corporate purposes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the Orders. 

Effective as of January 23, 2014, the OCC released and terminated the CFBank Order based upon the improved capital position of CFBank, among other factors. Following &#160; the release of the CFBank Order, CFBank was &#160; required to continue to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio of 8% and a Total Risk-based Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets ratio of 12% until these heightened capital requirements were lifted on December 23, 2015 . In addition, in connection with the release and termination of the CFBank Order, CFBank &#160; made certain commitments to the OCC to continue to adhere to certain prudent practices, including, without limitation, maintaining a written program to continue to improve CFBank&#8217;s credit underwriting and administrative process; take actions to protect its interest in criticized assets as identified by CFBank, the OCC examiners or its external loan review process and implement its written program to effectively identify, monitor, control and continue to reduce the level of credit risk to CFBank; review and monitor progress against such plan with the Board of Directors and continue CFBank&#8217;s aggressive workout efforts and individualized workout plans on all criticized assets greater than $250,000. The foregoing commitments remained in place until December 23, 2015. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the Orders. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

On May 15, 2014, the FRB announced the termination of the Holding Company Order, effective as of May 9, 2014. Following the termination of the Holding Company Order, the Holding Company was &#160; required to continue to adhere to certain requirements and restrictions based on commitments made to the FRB in connection with the termination of the Holding Company Order. These commitments require d the Holding Company, among other things, to continue to implement certain actions in accordance with the capital plan previously submitted to the FRB; not declare or pay dividends on its stock, purchase or redeem its stock, or accept dividends or other capital distributions from CFBank without the prior written approval of the FRB; not incur, increase or guarantee any debt without the prior written consent of the FRB; and provide prior written notice to the FRB with respect to certain changes in directors and senior executive officers. The foregoing commitments remained in place until January 8, 2016. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the Orders. 

The significant directives contained in the Orders and the commitments made by CFBank and the Holding Company in connection with the release and termination of the Orders &#160; provided challenges for the operation of our business and our ability to effectively compete in our markets over the past several years . In addition, the Orders and our &#160; commitments to the regulators , as described above, required that we obtain approval from our regulators for any deviations from our business plan, which &#160; limited our flexibility to make changes to the scope of our business activities. We have &#160; incurred significant additional regulatory compliance expense in connection with the Orders and our regulatory commitments . Although we are no longer subject to the Orders or the regulatory commitments made following the release of the Orders, we remain subject to extensive supervision and regulation by our regulators, and it is possible that regulatory compliance expenses could continue to have a material adverse impact on us in the future. 

Dividend Restrictions: The ability of the Holding Company to pay dividends on its common stock and Series B Preferred Stock is generally dependent upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from CFBank. The Holding Company is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from CFBank, which has no obligation to make any dividends or other funds available for the payment of dividends by the Holding Company. &#160; Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Any f uture dividend payments by CFBank to the Holding Company would be based on future earnings and , if necessary, regulatory approval. &#160; &#160; 

The Holding Company also is subject to various legal and regulatory requirements , policies and guidelines impacting the Holding Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its stock . In addition, the Holding Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its stock is conditioned upon the payment, on a current basis, of quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures underlying the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities. Finally, so long as the Company&#8217;s Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding, the Holding Company will be prohibited from paying dividends on (other than dividends payable solely in shares) the Company&#8217;s common stock, for the then-current dividend period, unless full dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or set aside for payment. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative, which means that if for any reason we do not declare cash dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for a quarterly dividend period we will have no obligation to pay any dividends for that period (i.e., the dividends will not accrue or cumulate), whether or not we declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for any subsequent dividend period. 

The Holding Company had $ 2.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 201 5 . Management believes that t he Holding Company has adequate operating capital for the foreseeable future.

&#160; 

Market Area and Competition 

Our &#160; primary market area s in Ohio are competitive market s for financial services &#160; and we face competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. D irect competition comes from a number of financial institutions operating in our market area, many of which have a statewide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence. Many of these financial institutions are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do . C ompetition for loans and deposits comes from savings institutions, mortgage banking companies, commercial banks , credit unions , brokerage firms and insurance companies. 

Lending Activities &#160; 

Loan Portfolio Composition. The loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage loans , &#160; mortgage loans secured by single-family residences and, to a lesser degree , consumer loans . It also consists of a portfolio of residential mortgage loans totaling $ 43.5 million &#160; a s a result of participation in the Northpointe Mortgage Purchase Program. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10- K , for additional information regarding the Northpointe Mortgage Purchase Program . CFBank also finances a variety of commercial and residential construction projects. At December 31, 201 5 , &#160; gross &#160; loans receivable totaled $ 303.7 million and in creased approximately $ 40 .3 million, or 15.3 % from $ 263.4 million at December 31, 201 4 . C ommercial, c ommercial real estate and multi-family mortgage loans , including related construction loans, totaled $ 171.6 million and represented 56.5 % of the gross loan portfolio at December 31, 201 5 &#160; as compared to &#160; 69.2 % of the gross loan portfolio &#160; at December 31, 201 4 . &#160; Commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage loan balances , including related construction loans, &#160; de creased $ 2.0 million, or 1.2 % during 201 5 . &#160; Portfolio &#160; s ingle-family residential mortgage loans , including related construction loans and residential mortgage loans originated through &#160; the Mortgage Purchase Program Loans , totaled $ 104.2 mil l ion and represented 34.3 % of total gross loans at year-end 201 5 , &#160; compared to 25.8 % at year - end 201 4 . &#160; The remainder of the portfolio consisted of &#160; consumer loans , which &#160; totaled &#160; $ 27.9 million, or 9.2 % of gross loans receivable , at year-end 201 5 . &#160; &#160; 

The types of loans originated are subject to federal and state law s and regulations. Interest rates charged on loans are affected by the demand for such loans , the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors. In turn, these factors are affected by, among other things, economic conditions, fiscal policies of the federal government, monetary policies of the F RB &#160; and legislative tax policies.

&#160;

&#160; 

Origination of Loans. L ending activities are conducted through our &#160; office s located in Summit, Cuyahoga, Franklin and Columbiana Counties, Ohio. We originat e commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family mortgage loans and also expanded into business financial services in the Akron, Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio markets. 

Commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family loans are originated with &#160; fixed, floating and ARM interest rates . Fixed - rate loans are generally limited to three to five years. &#160; Historically, CFBank also has also utilized interest - rate swaps to protect the related fixed - rate loans from changes in value due to changes in interest rates. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements &#160; included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information on interest-rate swaps . 

CFBank participates in various loan programs offered by the Small Business Administration (SBA) , enabling us to provide our customers and small business owners in our markets with access to funding to support their businesses, as well as reduce credit risk associated with these loans. Individual loans include SBA guarantees of up to 90%. 

A majority of our &#160; single- family mortgage loan originations are fixed-rate loans. C urrent originations of long-term , fixed-rate single-family mortgages are generally sold rather than retained in portfolio in order to minimize investment in long-term, fixed-rate assets that have the potential to expose the Company to long-term interest rate risk . &#160; Although we currently expect that most of our long-term , fixed-rate mortgage loan originations will continue to be sold , primarily on a servicing-released basis, a portion of the se loans may be retained for portfolio within our interest rate risk and profitability guidelines. 

Single-Family Mortgage Lending . A significant lending activity has been the origination of permanent conventional mortgage loans secured by single-family residences located within and outside of our &#160; primary market area. Loan originations are primarily obtained from our loan officers and their contacts with in the local real estate industry and with existing or past customers and members of the local communities . &#160; We offer both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans with maturities generally up to 3 0 years , priced competitively with current market rates . We offer several ARM loan programs with terms of up to 30 years and interest rates that adjust with a maximum adjustment limitation of 2.0% per year and a 6.0% lifetime cap. The interest rate adjustments on ARM loans currently offered are indexed to a variety of established indices and these loans do not provide for initial deep discount interest rates. We do not originate option ARM loans or loans with negative amortization . 

The volume and types of single-family ARM loan originations are affected by market factors such as the level of interest rates, consumer preferences, competition and the availability of funds. In recent years, demand for single-family ARM loans has been weak due to consumer preference for fixed-rate loans as a result of the low interest rate environment. Consequently, our origination of ARM loans on single-family residential properties has not been significant as compared to our origination of fixed-rate loans. 

We currently sell the majority of the single-family mortgage loans that we originate &#160; on a servicing released basis. All single-family mortgage loans sold are underwritten according to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) guidelines, or are underwritten to comply with additional guidelines as may be required by the individual investor . CFBank is a &#160; direct endorsed underwriter, a designation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that allow s us to offer loans insured by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). 

A high volume of residential mortgage originations is a key metric f or the continued success of our mortgage business. For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , single-family mortgage loan s &#160; originated for sale totaled $ 41.6 million, a &#160; de crease of $ 8 .9 million, or 17.0 % , &#160; compared to $ 50. 1 million that was originated in 201 4 . &#160; The de crease in originations was partially due to lower sales activity . The volume of refinance activity , which is very sensitive to market mortgage interest rates , &#160; was &#160; a significant factor that impacted the level of residential loan originations in 201 4 . &#160; &#160; If market mortgage rates increase , our mortgage production, and the resultant gains on sales of loans, could decrease. &#160; &#160; 

At December 31, 201 5 , portfolio single-family mortgage loans originated by CF Bank &#160; totaled $ 23.1 million, or 7.6 % of total loans . Our &#160; policy is to originate single-fa mily residential mortgage loans for portfolio in amounts up to 85 % &#160; of the &#160; lower of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property securing the loan , without requiring private mortgage insurance. Loans in excess of 85% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price of the property securing the loan require private mortgage insurance. Mortgage loans generally include due-on-sale clauses which provide us &#160; with the contractual right to deem the loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of the property without our &#160; consent. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Portfolio single-family ARM loans , which totaled $ 11. 9 &#160; million, or 14.5 % of the single-family mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 201 5 , generally pose credit risks not inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrowers&#8217; payments rise , increasing the potential for default. &#160; Periodic and lifetime caps on interest rate increases help to reduce the credit risks associated with ARM loans , but also limit the interest rate sensitivity of such loans. 

CFBank has participated in a Mortgage Purchase Program with Northpointe Bank (Northpointe), a Michigan banking corporation, since December 2012. Pursuant to the terms of a participation agreement, CFBank purchases participation interests in loans made by Northpointe related to fully underwritten and pre-sold mortgage loans originated by various prescreened mortgage brokers located throughout the U.S. The underlying loans are individually (MERS ) registered loans which are held until funded by the end investor. The mortgage loan investors include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and other major financial institutions such as Wells Fargo Bank. This process on average takes approximately 14 days. Given the short-term holding period of the underlying loans, common credit risks (such as past due, impairment and TDR, nonperforming, and nonaccrual classification) are substantially reduced. Therefore, no allowance is allocated by CFBank to these loans. These purchased loans are classified as portfolio loans. These loans are 100% risk rated for CFBank capital adequacy purposes. Northpointe maintains an ownership interest in each loan it participates. Effective December 18, 2014, the participation agreement was amended and CFBank agreed to increase the level of interest in loans it purchases from Northpointe from 80% to 95% of the aforementioned loans . As a result , Northpointe now maintains a 5% (reduced from 20%) ownership interest in each loan it participates. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10- K. 

Commercial Real E s tate and Multi-Family Residential &#160; Mortgage Lending . Origination of commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans &#160; continues to be a significant portion of CFBank&#8217;s lending activity . Commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loan balance s increased $ 5.5 million to $ 125.4 million at December 31, 201 5 . &#160; This represented an increase of 4.6 % over the $ 11 9 .9 million balance at December 31, 201 4 . &#160; 

We &#160; originate commercial real estate loans that are secured by properties used for business purposes , such as manufacturing facilities, office buildings or retail facilities . We originate multi-family residential mortgage loans that are secured by apartment buildings, condominiums, and multi-family residential houses. Commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans are secured by properties &#160; generally located in our primary market area. 

U nderwriting policies provide that c ommercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans may be made in amounts up to 8 5 % of the lower of the &#160; appraised value or purchase price of the property. &#160; &#160; An independent appraisal of the property is required on all loans greater than or equal to $250,000. &#160; In underwriting commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans, &#160; we consider the appraised value and net operating income of the property, the debt service ratio and t h e property owner &#8217;s and/or gua ran tor &#8217;s financial strength, expertise and credit history. &#160; &#160; We offer both fixed and adjustable rate loans. Fixed rate loans are generally limited to three to five years, at which time they convert to adjustable rate loans. &#160; &#160; At times, CFBank accommodates loans &#160; to borrowers who desire fixed - rate loans for longer than three to five years . &#160; We have utilized interest - rate swaps to protect the se fixed - rate loans from changes in value due to changes in interest rates, as appropriate. &#160; &#160; See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements i ncluded in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information on interest-rate swaps . Adjustable - rate loans are tied to various market indices and generally adjust monthly or annual ly . Payments on both fixed and adjustable rate loans are based on 15 to 25 year amortization periods. 

Commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans are generally considered to involve a greater degree of risk than single-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family residential properties are dependent on successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. As with single-family residential mortgage loans, adjustable rate commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans generally pose credit risks not inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrowers&#8217; payments rise, increasing the potential for default. &#160; &#160; Additionally, adjustable rate commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans generally do not contain periodic and lifetime caps on interest rate changes. We seek to minimize the additional risk presented by adjustable rate commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans through underwriting criteria &#160; that require such loans to be qualified at origination with sufficient debt coverage ratios under increasing interest rate scenarios . 

Commercial real estate and multi-family residential mortgage loans also have larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to single-family residential mortgage loans. Some of our borrowers also have more than one commercial real estate or multi-family residential mortgage loan outstanding with us. Additionally, some loans may be collateralized by junior liens. Consequently, an adverse development involving one or more loans or credit relationships can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development involving a single-family residential mortgage loan. We seek to minimize and 

&#160;

&#160; 

mitigate these risks through underwriting policies which require such loans to be qualified at origination on the basis of the property&#8217;s income and debt coverage ratio and the financial strength of the property &#160; owners and/or guarantors . 

Commercial Lending . The o rigination of commercial loans continues to be a significant component of our lending activity . &#160; &#160; During 201 5 , commercial lending activity de creased by $ 2.8 million, or 6.0 % , to $ 4 3 .7 million at year-end 201 5 . &#160; We &#160; originate commercial loans primarily to business es located within our primary market area . &#160; Commercial loans are generally secured by business equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and other business assets. In underwriting commercial loans, we consider the net operating income of the company, the debt service ratio and the financial strength, expertise and credit history of the business owners and/or guarantors . We offer both fixed and adjustable rate commercial loans. Fixed - rate loans are generally limited to a maximum term of five years. Adjustable - rate loans are tied to various market indices and generally adjust monthly or annual ly . 

Commercial loans are generally considered to involve a greater degree of risk than loans secured by real estate. Because payments on commercial loans are dependent on successful operation of the business enterprise, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the economy. We seek to mitigate these risks through underwriting policies which require such loans to be qualified at origination on the basis of the enterprise&#8217;s income and debt coverage ratio and the financial strength of the business owners and/or guarantors . &#160; 

Adjustable - rate commercial loans generally pose credit risks not inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrowers&#8217; payments rise, increasing the potential for default. Additionally, adjustable - rate commercial loans generally do not contain periodic and lifetime caps on interest rate changes. We seek to minimize the additional risk presented by adjustable - rate commercial loans through underwriting criteria that require such loans to be qualified at origination with sufficient debt coverage ratios under increasing interest rate scenarios. 

Construction and Land Lending . &#160; With some economic improvement in our market areas, there was also an increase in commercial building activity. During 201 5 , construction loans increased by $ 1.0 million, or 4.3 %, to $ 2 4 .7 million compared to the $ 23.6 million in the portfolio at year-end 201 4 . &#160; T he additional capital has allowed CFBank to take advantage of select market opportunities in this area &#160; within the risk tolerances we have identified . 

C onstruction loans are made to finance the construction of residential and commercial properties generally located within our primary market area . C onstruction loans are fixed - or adjustable-rate loans which may convert to permanent loans with maturities of up to 30 years. Our policies provide that construction loans may be made in amounts up to 80 % of the appraised value of the property , and an independent appraisal of the property is required . Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warr a nt and regular inspections are required to monitor the progress of construction. Land development loans generally do not exceed 7 5% of the actual cost or current appraised value of the property, whichever is less . Loans on raw land generally do not exceed 65% of the actual cost or current appraised value of the property, whichever is less . 

Construction and land financing is considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property&#8217;s value at completion of construction or development compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we &#160; may be confronted with a project, when completed, having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. We attempt to reduce such risks on construction loans by requiring personal guarantees and reviewing current personal financial statements and tax returns , as well as other projects of the developer. 

Consumer and Other Lending . The consumer loan portfolio generally consist s of home equity lines of credit, automobile loans, home improvement loans and loans secured by deposits. At December 31, 201 5 , the consumer loan portfolio totaled $ 27.9 million, which was 9.2 % of gross loans receivable. &#160; During 201 5 , the consumer loan portfolio grew $ 6. 0 million, or 27.3 % over the year-end 201 4 balance of $ 21.9 million. &#160; 

Home equity lines of credit include those purchased in the past and loans we originate for our portfolio . We offer a variable rate home equity line of credit which we originate for our portfolio. The interest rate &#160; adjust s monthly at various margins above the prime rate of interest as disclosed in The Wall Street Journal . The margin is based on certain factors including the loan balance , value of collateral , election of auto-payment and the borrower &#8217; s FICO &#174; score. The amount of the line is based on the borrower&#8217;s credit history , income and equity in the home. &#160; When combined with the balance of the prior mortgage liens, these lines generally may not exceed 89.9 % of the appraised value of the property at the time of the loan commitment. &#160; The lines are secured by a subordinate lien on the underlying real estate and are, therefore, vulnerable to declines in property values in the geographic areas where the properties are located . &#160; Credit approval for home equity lines of credit requires income sufficient to repay principal and interest due, stability of employment, an established credit record and sufficient collateral. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Delinquencies and Classified Assets. &#160; &#160; Management and the Board of Directors monitors the status of all loans 30 days or more past due on a monthly basis through the analysis of &#160; past due statistics and trends for all loans . &#160; &#160; P rocedures with respect to resolving delinquencies vary depending on the nature and type of the loan and period of delinquency. W e make effort s , consistent with safety and soundness principles, to work with the borrower and develop action steps to have the loan brought current. If the loan is not brought current , it then becomes necessary to take additional legal actions including the &#160; repossession of collateral. 

We maintain an internal credit rating system and loan review procedures specifically developed to monitor credit risk for commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans. Internal loan reviews for these loan types are performed at least annually, and more often for loans with higher credit risk. Loan officers maintain close contact with borrowers between reviews. Adjustments to loan risk ratings are based on the reviews and at any time information is received that may affect risk ratings. Additionally, an independent third party review of commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family residential loans is performed at least annually. &#160; Management uses the results of th ese review s to help determine the effectiveness of the existing policies and procedures and to provide an independent assessment of our internal loan risk rating system. 

Federal regulations and CFBank&#8217;s asset classification policy require use of an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting and monitoring assets. We have incorporated the regulatory asset classifications as a part of our credit monitoring and internal loan risk rating system . L oans are classified into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt, such as &#160; current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information and current economic trends, among other factors. In accordance with regulations, p roblem loans are classified as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss , and the classifications are subject to review by banking regulators . Loans designated as special mention are considered criticized assets. Loans designated as substandard, doubtful or loss are considered classified assets. Loans designated as special mention &#160; possess weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of CFBank&#8217;s credit position at some future date. A loan is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that there will be some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. A loan considered doubtful has all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, condition and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans designated as loss are considered uncollectible based on the borrower&#8217;s inability to make payments, and any value attached to collateral, if any, is based on liquidation value . Loans considered loss are generally uncollectible and have so little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted and are charged off, unless certain circumstances exit that could potentially warrant a specific reserve be established . 

See the section titled &#8220; Financial Condition - &#160; Allowance for loan losses&#8221; &#160; and Notes 1 &#160; and &#160; 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for detailed information on criticized and classified loans as of December 31, 201 5 and 20 1 4 . 

Classified loans include all n onaccrual loans , which are discussed in further detail in the section below titled &#8220;Nonperforming Asset s &#8221; . In addition to nonaccrual loans, classified loans include the following loans that were identified as substandard assets , &#160; were still accruing interest &#160; at December 31, 20 1 5 , but exhibit weaknesses that could lead to nonaccrual status in the future .

TDRs where customers have established a sustained period of repayment performance, loans are current according to their modified terms, and repayment of the remaining contractual payments is expected. 

&#160; 

The $ 123,000 &#160; de crease in nonperforming loans in 20 1 5 &#160; compared to 201 4 &#160; was primarily due to loan payments and payoffs . &#160; &#160; The re were $ 149 ,000 in loans that became nonperforming in 201 5 related to four &#160; single family residential loans. &#160; 

CFBank has seen steady improvement in the credit quality of its level of nonperforming loans over the last three years. &#160; The majority of the nonperforming loans were &#160; primarily related to deterioration in the commercial, multi-family residential real estate, commercial real estate, and home equity lines of credit portfolios as a result of the sustained adverse economic conditions and its e ffect on collateral values and borrowers&#8217; ability to make loan payments . &#160; &#160; For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , the amount of additional interest income that would have been recognized on nonaccrual loans, if such loans had continued to perform in accordance with their contractual terms, was approximately $ 94 ,000 . There was no interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans in 201 5 . &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-02 to Receivables (ASC 310), A Creditor&#8217;s Determination of Whether a Restructuring is a Troubled Debt Restructuring , &#160; clarif ied the guidance for a creditor&#8217;s evaluation of whether it ha s granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. &#160; With regard to determining whether a concession has been granted, the ASU clarified that creditors are precluded from using the effective interest method to determine whether a concession has been granted. In the absence of using the effective interest method, a creditor must now focus on other considerations such as the value of the underlying collateral, evaluation of other collateral or guarantees, the debtor&#8217;s ability to access other funds at market rates, interest rate increases and whether the restructuring results in a delay in payment that is insignificant. &#160; &#160; The Company applies the guidance in this ASU to identify its restructured loans as troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;). Loans restructured in 201 5 identified as TDRs totaled $ 1 8 ,000 . 

As a component of management&#8217;s focus on the work &#160; out of troubled credits, the terms of certain loans were modified in TDRs , where concessions were granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. &#160; The modification of the terms of such loans may have included one or a combination of the following: a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan; an increase in the stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk; an extension of the maturity date; or a change in the payment terms. N onaccrual loans included $ 356 ,000 &#160; in TDRs at December 31, 201 5 , while non-accrual loans included $ 422,000 of TDRs at December 31, 201 4 . &#160; 

A t year-end 201 5 there were a total of $ 5. 3 million of TDR s , &#160; includ ing &#160; $ 1.6 million &#160; in multi-family loans, $ 2.8 million in commercial real estate loans, $ 249 ,000 &#160; in land loans, $ 12 8 ,000 &#160; in single family residential loans &#160; and $ 199 ,000 &#160; in commercial loans which we re not included in nonperforming loans, where customers have established a sustained period of repayment performance, loans are current according to their modified terms, and repayment of the remaining contractual payments is expected. 

See the section titled &#8220; Financial Condition - &#160; Allowance for loan losses&#8221; and Notes 1 &#160; and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information on nonperforming loans and TDRs as of December 31, 201 5 and 20 1 4 . 

For information on real estate owned (REO) and other foreclosed assets, see the section below titled &#8220;Foreclosed Assets.&#8221; 

Allowance for Loan Losses (ALLL) . &#160; &#160; The ALLL is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. The ALLL methodology is designed as part of a thorough process that incorporates management&#8217;s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio into a determination of the ALLL in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and supervisory guidance. Management analyzes the adequacy of the ALLL quarterly through reviews of the loan portfolio, including : the nature and volume of the loan portfolio and segments of the portfolio; industry and loan concentrations; historical loss experience; delinquency statistics and the level of nonperforming loans; specific problem loans; the ability of borrowers to meet loan terms; an evaluation of collateral securing loans and the market for various types of collateral; various collection strategies; current economic condition, trends and outlook; and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate ALLL . See the section titled &#8220; Financial Condition - &#160; Allowance for loan losses&#8221; in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of management&#8217;s methodology for determining the appropriate level of the ALLL. 

The ALLL totaled $6. 6 million at December 31, 201 5 , and increased $ 304 ,000, or 4.8 %, from $ 6.3 million at December 31, 201 4 . The increase in the ALLL is due to a combination of factors including a 15.3 % increase in overall loan balances and net recoveries during the twelve months ended December 31, 201 5, which was partially offset by continuous improvement in credit quality and a 8.0 % decrease in nonperforming loans. The ratio of the ALLL to total loans was 2. 18 % at December 31, 201 5 , compared to 2. 39 % at December 31, 201 4. In addition, the ratio of the ALLL to nonperforming loans improved to 464.6 % at December 31, 201 5 , compared to 408.0 % at December 31, 201 4 . 

We believe the ALLL is adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 201 5 ; however , future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on factors inclu ding, but not limited to, deterioration in client business per formance, recessionary economic conditions, declines in borrowers&#8217; cash flows, and market conditions which result in lower real estate values. Additionally, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the ALLL. Such agencies may require additional provisions for loan losses based on judgments and estimates that differ from those used by management. Management continues to diligently monitor credit quality in the existing portfolio and analyze potential loan opportunities carefully in order to manage credit risk. An increase in estimated probable incurred losses and a n increase in required loan provision expense could occur if economic conditions and factors which affect credit quality, real estate values and gene ral business conditions worsen.

Foreclosed Assets 

Assets acquired through or instead of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation allowance is recorded through expense. Operating and maintenance costs after acquisition are expensed. REO and other f oreclosed assets totaled $ 1.6 &#160; million at December 31, 201 5 and 201 4 . &#160; See the section titled &#8220; Financial Condition - &#160; Foreclosed Assets&#8221; &#160; and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements &#160; in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for information regarding foreclosed assets at December 31, 201 5 . F oreclosure activities are closely tied with general economic conditions and the ability of our customers to continue to meet their loan payment obligations and, therefore, the level of foreclosed assets may increase in the future if, among other things, economic conditions in our market area decline . &#160; &#160; 

Investment Activities 

Federally &#160; chartered savings institutions have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, bankers&#8217; acceptances and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, federally &#160; chartered savings institutions may also invest their assets in commercial paper , municipal bonds , investment-grade corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally &#160; chartered savings institution is otherwise authorized to make directly. 

The investment policy established by the &#160; Board of Directors is designed to provide and maintain adequate liquidity, generate a favorable return on investment &#160; without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk , and compliment lending activities. The policy provide s authority to invest in U.S. Treasury and federal entity/ agency securities meeting the policy&#8217;s &#160; guidelines , mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations insured or guaranteed by the U nited S tates government and its entities/ agencies , municipal and corporate bonds and other investment instruments . 

&#160;

&#160; 

At December 31, 201 5 , the securities portfolio totaled $ 9 .4 million . At December 31, 201 5 , all mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations in the securities portfolio were insured or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae . &#160; 

Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. &#160; See Note s 1 &#160; and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of management&#8217;s evaluation of securities for OTTI.

Sources of Funds 

General . CFBank&#8217;s p rimary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, proceeds from sales of loans, borrowings, and funds generated from operations of CF Bank. &#160; Contractual loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced b y general market interest rates and economic conditions and competition . &#160; Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes or on a long-term basis to fund asset growth or manage interest rate risk in accordance with asset/liability management strategies . &#160; 

The Holding Company, as a savings and loan holding company, has more limited sources of liquidity than CFBank . In general, in addition to its existing liquid assets, sources of liquidity include funds raised in the securities markets through debt or equity offerings, dividends received from its subsidiaries or the sale of assets. 

Pursuant to commitments made in connection with the termination of the Holding Company Order, the Holding Company was &#160; not permitted to declare or pay dividends on its stock, purchase or redeem its stock, or accept dividends or other capital distributions from CFBank without the prior written approval of the FRB. In addition, the Holding Company could &#160; not incur, increase or guarantee any debt without the prior written consent of the FRB. The Holding Company was &#160; not restricted, however, from raising funds in the securities markets through equity offerings. &#160; &#160; These commitments remained in place until January 8, 2016, but the restrictions are no longer applicable to the Holding Company after January 8, 21016. See the section titled &#8220;Financial Condition &#8211; Stockholders&#8217; equity &#8221; included in our 201 5 &#160; Annual Report to Stockholders , included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K. 

CFBank dividends serve as a potential source of liquidity to the Holding Company to meet its obligations. Generally, CFBank may pay dividends to the Holding Company without prior approval as long as the dividend does not exceed the total of the current calendar year-to-date earnings plus any earnings from the previous two years not already paid out in dividends, and as long as CFank remains well capitalized after the dividend payment. Any f uture dividend payments by CFBank to the Holding Company would be based on future earnings and, if necessary, regulatory approval . See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K. 

The Holding Company&#8217;s available cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 2.7 million at December 31, 201 5 . Based on historical cash utilization rate and estimates of future requirements, there is sufficient liquidity to cover operating expenses for the foreseeable future . &#160; &#160; See the section titled &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for information regarding Holding Company liquidity and regulatory matters. 

Deposits . CFBank offer s a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms including &#160; savings accounts, retail and business &#160; checking accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Management regularly evaluates the internal cost of funds, surveys rates offered by competitors, reviews cash flow requirements for lending and liquidity and executes rate changes when necessary as part of its asset/liability management, profitability and liquidity objectives. &#160; C ertificate of deposit accounts represent the largest portion of our deposit portfolio and totaled &#160; 52.3 % of average deposit balances in 201 5 . The term of the certificates of deposit typically offered vary from seven days to five years at rates established by management. Specific terms of an individual account vary according to the type of account, the minimum balance required, the time period funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. 

The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. Deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which CFBank &#8217;s offices are located. We rely primarily on a willingness to pay market-competitive interest rates to attract and retain retail deposits, as well as customer service and relationships with customers . Prior to the release of the CFBank Order &#160; on January 23, 2014, &#160; we were prohibited from offering above-market interest rates a nd were subject to market rate limitation s published by the FDIC when offering deposits to the general public . Accordingly, rates offered by competing financial institutions affect ed our ability to attract and retain deposits. 

At December 31, 201 5 , CFBank had $ 22.1 million in brokered deposits with maturity dates from January 201 6 through May 2020 . At December 31, 201 5 , cash, unpledged securities and deposits in other financial institutions totaled $ 25.6 million . 

&#160;

&#160; 

CFBank has been a participant in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service &#174; (CDARS), a network of banks that allows us to provide our customers with FDIC insurance coverage on certificate of deposit account balances up to $50 million. &#160; Although CFBank customers participate in the CDARS program, CDARS deposits are considered brokered deposits by banking regulation. Customer balances in the CDARS program totaled $ 9.2 million at December 31, 201 5 &#160; and de creased $ 856,000 , or 8.4 %, from $ 10.2 million at December 31, 201 4 . &#160; 

While the CFBank Order was in place from May 2011 until January 2014, CFBank was prohibited from accepting or renewing brokered deposits, including CDARS balances. CFBank received limited waivers from the prohibition on renewal of reciprocal CDARS deposits from the FDIC, and the restrictions were subsequently lifted upon the termination of the CFBank Order in January 2014 . 

Certificate accounts in amounts of $100,000 or more totaled $ 106. 6 million a t December 31, 201 5 , maturing as follows:

Borrowings. &#160; As part of our operating strategy, FHLB advances are used as an alternative to retail and brokered deposits to fund our asset growth . &#160; The advances are collateralized primarily by single-family mortgage loans, multi-family mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, securities and cash , and secondarily by CFBank&#8217;s investment in the capital stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati . FHLB advances are made pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. &#160; The maximum amount that the FHLB will advance to member institutions fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the FHLB. &#160; FHLB advances totaled $ 14.5 million at December 31, 201 5 . Based on the collateral pledged and CFBank&#8217;s holdings of FHLB stock, CFBank was eligible to borrow up to a total of $ 30.3 million at year-end 201 5 . Immediately prior to January 1, 2014, due to regulatory considerations, CFBank was only eligible for future advances with a maximum maturity of 365 days. On January 24, 2014, CFBank was notified by the FHLB that the restriction on the term of future advances had been lifted as a result of the CFBank Order being terminated effective January 23, 2014 . 

In addition to access to FHLB advances, CFBank ha s &#160; borrowing capacity available with the Federal Reserve Bank through the Borrower in Custody program . The borrowings are collateralized by commercial and commercial real estate loans. Based on the collateral pledged, CFBank wa s eligible to borrow up to a total of $ 30.2 million at year-end 201 5 . There were no amounts outstanding from the F ederal R eserve B ank at December 31, 201 5 . CFBank also ha d &#160; $ 1 .0 million a vailable in an unsecured line of credit with a commercial bank at December 31, 201 5 . Interest on this line accrues daily and is variable based on the commercial bank&#8217;s cost of funds and current market returns. &#160; &#160; There w as no amount outstanding on th is line of credit at December 31, 201 5 . See the section titled &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; contained in our 201 5 &#160; Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information. 

During the course of 2013 , CFBank had engaged in certain loan participations that according to the structure of the transactions, d id not qualify for sales accounting treatment, and were therefore accounted for as secured borrowings. CFBank retains an ownership interest in these loans and provides customary servicing to the third-parties which are typically other community banks. As of January 1, 2014 , there were five loan participations classified as secured borrowings totaling $6.5 million. During the first quarter of 2014, management amended its loan participation agreements to remove the language that disqualified the loan participations from sales accounting treatment and entered into amended loan participation agreements with the participating institutions with respect to the aforementioned loans. There were no secured borrowing transactions as of December 31, 201 5 .

Regulation and Supervision &#160; 

Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and re g ulations that apply to us. This description, as well as other descriptions of laws and regulations contained in this Form 10-K, is not complete and is qualified in its entiret y by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. 

General. The Holding Company, as a federally chartered savings and loan holding company , and CFBank, as a federal savings association , have historically been subject to examination and comprehensive federal regulation and oversight by the OTS. As of July 21, 2011 , the Dodd-Frank Act imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions. &#160; In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act transferred the regulatory responsibilities and authority over federal savings associations and savings and loan holding companies from the OTS to the OCC and the F RB , respectively. &#160; CFBank has also been and continues to be subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of CFBank to the maximum extent permitted by law, and certain other requirements established by the F RB . 

The investment and lending authority of savings institutions is prescribed by federal laws and regulations, and such institutions are prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws or regulations. Such regulations and supervision primarily are intended for the protection of depositors and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. 

Federal law provides federal banking regulators, including the OCC, the F RB and the FDIC, with substantial enforcement powers. The enforcement authority of the OCC and the F RB over savings institutions and their holding companies includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions. &#160; In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound practices. &#160; Other actions or inactions may also provide the basis for enforcement action. 

For information with respect to the operating and other restrictions imposed on the Holding Company and CFBank by the F RB and the OCC as a result of the Orders , see the section above &#160; titl ed &#8220;Regulatory Order Considerations .&#8221; 

&#160;

Recently Enacted Regulatory Reform. Federal regulators continue to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010 . &#160; The Dodd-Frank Act created many new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. &#160; Currently, federal regulators are still in the process of drafting the implementing regulations for some &#160; portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. &#160; The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the new law that may affect the Holding Company and CFBank: 

&#183; 

Effective July 21, 2011, the OTS was merged into the OCC and the authority of the other remaining bank regulatory agencies was restructured; 

&#183; 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established and empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws; 

&#183; 

New capital regulations for thrift holding companies were adopted; 

&#183; 

The prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed, effective July 21, 2011 ; 

&#183; 

The standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer was permanently increased to $250,000; 

&#183; 

The deposit insurance assessment base calculation was expanded to equal a depository institution&#8217;s total assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period; 

&#183; 

New capital regulations for bank holding companies have been adopted, which will impose stricter capital requirements , and any new trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010 will no longer constitute Tier I capital; and 

&#183; 

New corporate governance requirements applicable to all public companies in all industries now require new compensation practices and disclosure requirements, including requiring companies to &#8220;claw back&#8221; incentive compensation under certain circumstances, to consider the independence of compensation advisors, and to make additional disclosures in proxy statements with respect to compensation matters. 

Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been fully implemented and will require interpretation and rule making by federal regulators. While the full &#160; effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on us cannot currently be determined, the law and its implementing rules and regulations are likely to result in increased compliance costs and fees paid to regulators, along with possible restrictions on our operations, all of which may have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition. 

Regulation of the Holding Company 

General. The Holding Company, as a unitary savings and loan holding company, is subject to regulation, periodic examination, enforcement authority and oversight by the FRB. As a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, CFBank is also subject to certain restrictions in its dealings with the Holding Company and its affiliates. 

Capital. Historically, s avings and loan holding companies were &#160; not subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, require d the F RB to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, t here was &#160; a five year transition period such that the capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies went into effect on July 21, 2015. In April 2015, however, the FRB issued a final rule which extended application of the FRB&#8217;s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to savings and loan holding companies an d increased the size limitation for qualifying bank holding companies from $500 million to $1 billion of total consolidated assets. Under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, qualifying holding companies are exempt from the FRB&#8217;s risk-based capital and leverage rules. Holding companies, including savings and loan holding companies, qualify for exemption under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy if they have less than $1 billion in total consolidated assets and meet certain qualitative requirements, including not engaging in significant nonbanking activities and not conducting significant off-balance sheet activities . &#160; 

Source of Strength . The Dodd-Frank Act also extends the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must promulgate regulations implementing the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; policy that requires holding companies to act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 

Activities Restrictions. As a unitary savings and loan holding company, there are generally few restrictions on the activities of the Holding Company; however, this broad latitude to engage in activities can be restricted if the F RB determines an activity constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of its subsidiary savings association or if the association fails to qualify as a qualified thrift lender (QTL). The F RB may impose restrictions it deems necessary to address such risk, including limiting (i) payment of dividends by the savings association; (ii) transactions between the savings association and its affiliates; and (iii) any activities of the savings association that might create a serious risk that the liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may be imposed on the savings association. 

&#160;

If the Holding Company were to acquire control of another savings institution to be held as a separate subsidiary, the Holding Company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company. Except where such acquisition is pursuant to the authority to approve emergency thrift acquisitions and each subsidiary savings institution meets the QTL test, the activities of the Holding company and any of its subsidiaries (other than CFBank or other subsidiary savings institutions) would thereafter be subject to further restrictions. 

Regulation of CFBan k 

General. CFBank, as a federally chartered savings institution, is subject to regulation, periodic examination, enforcement authority and oversight by the OCC extending to all aspects of CFBank&#8217;s operations. CFBank also is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of CFBank to the maximum extent permitted by law. This regulation and supervision primarily is intended for the protection of depositors and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders . CFBank&#8217;s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both Federal and state laws, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of CFBank&#8217;s mortgage requirements. 

The investment and lending authority of federal savings institutions are prescribed by federal laws and regulations, and federal savings institutions are prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations. In addition, all savings institutions, including CFBank, are required to maintain QTL status to avoid certain restrictions on their operations. This status is maintained by meeting the QTL test, which requires a savings institution to have a designated level of thrift-related assets generally consisting of residential housing related loans and investments, thereby indirectly limiting investment in other assets. At December 31, 201 5 , CFBank met the QTL test and has met the test since its effectiveness. If CFBank loses QTL status, it would become subject to national bank investment and activity limits. 

The OCC, as well as other federal banking agencies, has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and employee benefits. Any institution which fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements . Savings institutions are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. The OCC has established capital standards, including a leverage ratio or core capital requirement and a risk-based capital requirement applicable to savings institutions. The OCC also may impose capital requirements in excess of these standards on individual institutions on a case-by-case basis. 

The capital standards general ly require core capital equal to at least 4.0% of adjusted total assets. Core capital consists of tangible capital plus certain intangible assets, including a limited amount of purchased credit card relationships. The OCC also requires savings institutions to have total capital of at least 8.0% of risk-weighted assets. Total capital consists of core capital, as defined above, and supplementary capital. Supplementary capital consists of certain permanent and maturing capital instruments that do not qualify as core capital and general valuation loan and lease loss allowances up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. The OCC is also authorized to require a savings institution to maintain an additional amount of total capital to account for concentration of credit risk and the risk of non-traditional activities. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance-sheet items, are multiplied by a risk weight determined based on the risk inherent in the type of asset. 

The CFBank Order required CFBank to have an 8% Tier 1 (Core) Capital to adjusted total assets and 12% Total Capital to risk weighted assets. &#160; Following the termination of the CFBank Order effective January 23, 2014, CFBank remain ed subject to the heightened capital requirements imposed by the OCC and was &#160; required to maintain an 8% Tier 1 (core) Capital ratio to adjusted total assets and 12% Total Capital to risk weighted assets until December 23, 2015 . CFBank met the heightened capital requirements imposed by the OCC at December 31, 2014 , and was no longer subject to the heightened capital requirements at December 31, 2015 . See Note 2-Regulatory Order Considerations and Note 19-Regulatory Capital Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information. 

Any savings institution that fails to comply with its capital plan or has a Tier 1 risk-based or core capital ratio of less than 3.0% or a risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% and is considered &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; must be made subject to one or more additional specified actions and operating restrictions which may cover all aspects of its operations and may include a forced merger or acquisition of the institution. The OCC is also generally authorized to reclassify an institution into a lower capital category and impose the restrictions applicable to such category if the institution is engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. 

&#160;

The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the &#8220;International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard&#8221; (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) in 1988. In 2004, the Basel Committee published a new capital adequacy framework (Basel II) for large, internationally active banking organizations, and in December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee issued an update to Basel II (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;). The Basel Committee frameworks did not become applicable to banks supervised in the United States until adopted into United States law or regulations. Although the United States banking regulators imposed some of the Basel II and Basel III rules on banks with $250 billion or more in assets or $10 billion of on-balance sheet foreign exposure, it was not until July 2013 that the United States banking regulators issued final (or, in the case of the FDIC, interim final) new capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations which also implement certain of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;Basel III Capital Rules&#8221;). Community banking organizations, including CFBank, began transitioning to the new rules on January 1, 2015. The new minimum capital requirements became effective on January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phase in from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital will phase in from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019 . 

The new rules include (a) a new common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, (b) a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.0%, rather than the former 4.0%, (c) a minimum total capital ratio that remains at 8.0%, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. 

Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions. 

Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions. 

Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions. 

The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization&#8217;s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels). The deductions phase in from 2015 through 2019. 

Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet. To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Some of the risk weightings were changed effective January 1, 2015. 

The new rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent at the beginning of the quarter. The capital conservation buffer phases in starting on January 1, 2016, at .625%. The implementation of Basel III is not expected to have a material impact on CFBank&#8217;s capital ratios. 

FDIC Regulation and Insurance of Accounts. &#160; CFBank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the FDIC, and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. Effective July 21 , 2010 , the basic deposit insurance level was increased to $250,000. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. Our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended December 31, 201 5 &#160; were $ 421 ,000 , which increased from the previous year due to an increase in the assessment base upon which the insurance premiums are calculated . &#160; &#160; Generally, FDIC insurance premiums have increased in recent years and may continue to increase due to strains on the FDIC deposit insurance fund . 

In accordance with the Dodd- Frank Act, the FDIC issued new regulations setting insurance premium assessments effective April 2011 . The new premiums are based on an institution&#8217;s total assets minus its Tier 1 capital instead of its deposits. The intent of the new assessment calculations is not to substantially change the level of premiums paid, notwithstanding the use of assets as the calculation base instead of deposits. CFBank&#8217;s premiums are based on its assignment under one of four risk categories based on capital, supervisory ratings and other factors. &#160; &#160; If our risk category changes , our premiums could increase substantially . 

&#160;

In addition, the FDIC has proposed changing the deposit insurance premium assessment method for banks with less than $10 billion in assets that have been insured by the FDIC for at least five years. The proposed changes would revise the financial ratios method so that it would be based on a statistical model estimating the probability of failure of a bank over three years; update the financial measures used in the financial ratios method consistent with the statistical model; and eliminate risk categories for established small banks and use the financial ratios methods to determine assessment rates for all such banks (subject to minimum or maximum initial assessment rates based upon a bank&#8217;s composite examination rating). 

The FDIC also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity that it determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the deposit insurance fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against CFBank and may terminate our deposit insurance if it determines that we have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or are in an unsafe or unsound condition. 

Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions. Banking regulations impose various restrictions on distributions of capital, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. 

Generally, for savings institutions such as CFBank, it is required that before and after the proposed distribution the institution remain well-capitalized. Savings institutions may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to the &#160; greater &#160; of 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years. However, an institution deemed to be in need of more than normal supervision by the O CC may have its dividend authority restricted by the O CC . &#160; Pursuant to the CFBank Order and the commitments applicable to CFBank following the termination of the CFBank Order , CFBank was not permitted to declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions without receiving prior written approval of the OCC . These commitments remained in place until December 23, 2015, but the restrictions are no longer applicable to CFBank after December 23, 2015. 

The ability of the Holding Company to pay dividends on its common stock and Series B Preferred Stock is generally dependent upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from CFBank. The Holding Company is a legal en tity that is separate and distinct from CFBank, which has no obligation to make any dividends or other funds available for the payment of dividends by the Holding Company. The Holding Company also is subject to various legal and regulatory requirements , policies and guidelines impacting the Holding Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its stock . In addition, the Holding Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends on its stock is conditioned upon the payment, on a current basis, of quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures underlying the Company&#8217;s trust preferred securities . Finally, so long as the Company&#8217;s Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding, the Holding Company will be prohibited from paying dividends on (other tha n dividends payable solely in shares) the Company&#8217;s common stock, for the then-current dividend period, unless full dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or set aside for payment. Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are non-cumulative, which means that if for any reason we do not declare cash dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for a quarterly dividend period we will have no obligation to pay any dividends for that period (i.e., the dividends will not accrue or cumulate), whether or not we declare dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for any subsequent dividend period. See Note 2-Regulatory Order Considerations and Note 19-Regulatory Capital Matters to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information . 

Federal income tax laws provided additional deductions, totaling $2,250, for thrift bad debt reserves established before 1988. Accounting standards do not require a deferred tax liability to be recorded on this amount, which otherwise would total $765 at year-end 201 5 . However, if CFBank were wholly or partially liquidated or otherwise ceases to be a bank, or if tax laws were to change, this amount would have to be recaptured and a tax liability recorded. Additionally, any distributions in excess of CFBank&#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits would reduce amounts allocated to its bad debt reserve and create a tax liability for CFBank. The amount of additional taxable income created by such a distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if CFBank makes a distribution that reduces the amount allocated to its bad debt reserve, then approximately one and one-half times the amount used would be includible in gross income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 34% corporate income tax rate. CFBank does not intend to make distributions that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserve. 

&#160;

Federal and State Taxation 

Federal Taxation &#160; General. &#160; We &#160; report income on a calendar year, consolidated basis using the accrual method of accounting, and we are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations , with some exceptions discussed below . The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and CFBank. 

Our deferred tax assets are composed of U.S. net operating losses (&#8220;NOLs&#8221;), and other temporary book to tax differences. The Company recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance which reduced the Company&#8217;s deferred tax asset to zero beginning in 2009 and continuing through the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company maintained this valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2014 based on its estimate of future reversal and utilization. As a result, there was no income tax benefit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

When determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized, and therefore recorded as a benefit, the Company conducts a regular assessment of all available information. This information includes, but is not limited to, taxable income in prior periods, projected future income and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. Based on these criteria, the Company determined as of December 31, 2015, in part because the Company had achieved seven consecutive quarters of pretax income, that it was no longer necessary to maintain a full valuation allowance against the entire net deferred tax asset. As a result, the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset was reversed which resulted in a credit to income tax expense of $3.2 million. 

In 2012, a recapitalization program through the sale of $22.5 million in common stock improved the capital levels of the Bank and provided working capital for the holding company. The result of the change in stock ownership associated with the stock offering, within the guidelines of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, was that the Company incurred an ownership change. At year-end 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $25,166, which expire at various dates from 2024 to 2033, and has alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $105, which do not expire. As a result of the ownership change, the Company's ability to utilize carryforwards that arose before the stock offering closed is limited to $163 per year. Due to this limitation, management determined it is more likely than not that $20,520 of net operating loss carryforwards will expire unutilized. As required by accounting standards, the Company reduced the carrying value of deferred tax assets, and the corresponding valuation allowance, by the $6,977 tax effect of this lost realizability. 

Federal income tax laws provided additional deductions, totaling $2,250, for thrift bad debt reserves established before 1988. Accounting standards do not require a deferred tax liability to be recorded on this amount, which otherwise would total $765 at year-end 2015. However, if CFBank were wholly or partially liquidated or otherwise ceases to be a bank, or if tax laws were to change, this amount would have to be recaptured and a tax liability recorded. Additionally, any distributions in excess of CFBank&#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits would reduce amounts allocated to its bad debt reserve and create a tax liability for CFBank. The amount of additional taxable income created by such a distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if CFBank makes a distribution that reduces the amount allocated to its bad debt reserve, then approximately one and one-half times the amount used would be includible in gross income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 34% corporate income tax rate. CFBank does not intend to make distributions that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserve. 

See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 201 5 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K, for additional information. 

Distributions. Under the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, if CF Bank makes &#8220;non-dividend distributions&#8221; to the C ompany , such distributions will be considered to have been made from CFBank&#8217;s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves (including the balance of its reserves as of December 31, 1987) to the extent thereof, and then from CF Bank &#8217;s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent thereof, and an amount based on the amount distributed (but not in excess of the amount of such reserves) will be included in CF Bank &#8217;s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of CF Bank &#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of CF Bank &#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in CF Bank &#8217;s taxable income. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if CF Bank makes a non-dividend distribution to the Holding C ompany , approximately one and one-half times the amount of such distribution (but not in excess of the amount of the reserves described in the previous paragraph ) would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 34 % federal corporate income tax rate. CFB ank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves. 

Ohio Taxation 

Beginning on January 1, 2014, the Ohio corporate franchise tax began to be phased out and the Holding Company was no long er subject to this tax on a stand-alone basis thereafter . For the 2014 tax year the consolidated organization was subject to the newly enacted Ohio Financial Institutions tax ( &#8220; FIT &#8221; ). The FIT &#160; is a business privilege tax for financial institutions doing business or domiciled in the State of Ohio. The three-tier structure charges financial institutions based on total capital at the prior calendar year-end based on regulatory reporting requirements. Based on its size, the Holding Company was charged at 80 basis points of its total equity capital. 

Delaware Taxation 

As a Delaw are corporation not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax , but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
