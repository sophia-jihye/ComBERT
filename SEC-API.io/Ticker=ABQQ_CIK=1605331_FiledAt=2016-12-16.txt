GENERAL

&#160;

AB INTERNATIONAL GROUP CORP. (the "Company", "we" or "us") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 29, 2013 ("Inception") and originally intended to purchase used cars in the United States and sell them in Krygyzstan. The Company's fiscal year end is August 31.

&#160;

On January 22, 2016, the Company's former sole officer, who owned 83% of the Company's outstanding common shares, sold all his common shares to un-related investor Jianli Deng, the Company's current Chief Executive Officer and sole Director. After the stock sale, the Company modified its business plan and presently intends to focus on the creation of a mobile app marketing engine.

&#160;

We may borrow funds from our officers and shareholders for working capital, however, they have no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the Company. We are a development stage company and have generated $28,200 [year ended August 31,2016] in revenue under our new business plan.

We plan to be in the business of mobile app marketing for movie trailer promotion thru a mobile smartphone app in China. We plan to generate a subscriber base of smartphone users primarily through pre-installed app smartphone makers, online app stores, WeChat official accounts, Weibo and other social network medis and sell prepaid cards or coins to movie distributors or other video advertisers in China. We have created the app &#8220;Amoney&#8221; (available for download on http://fir.im/aMoney and QR code as well) for the Android smartphone platform to develop a WeChat micro-shop (see this for reference: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/062416/silicon-valley-eyeing-chinas-wechat-fb-aapl.asp ) that will display and deliver a variety of information and links for download or online watch prices in the China market, and will advertise our services and fees. During FYE August 31, 2016, we generated revenue of $28,200 from one company that paid us to post their movie trailers on our smartphone app for a one month period.
