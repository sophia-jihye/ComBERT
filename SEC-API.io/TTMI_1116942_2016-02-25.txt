Industry Overview 

PCBs are manufactured in panels from sheets of laminated material. Each panel is typically subdivided into multiple PCBs, each consisting of a pattern of electrical circuitry etched from copper to provide an electrical connection between the components mounted to it. PCBs serve as the foundation for virtually all electronic products, ranging from consumer electronics products (such as cameras, smartphones, and tablets) to high-end commercial electronic equipment (such as medical instruments, data communications equipment and servers) and aerospace and defense electronic systems. 

In recent years, the demand for smaller sized electronic devices with more features and functionality has been increasing. Products designed to offer faster data transmission, thinner and more lightweight packaging, and reduced power consumption generally require increasingly complex PCBs to meet these criteria. By using High Density Interconnect (HDI) technology, circuit densities can be increased, thereby providing for smaller products with higher packaging densities. Furthermore, flexible circuits technology, which includes flexible circuits, rigid-flex circuits, and flex assemblies, and substrate PCBs, can be found in small and lightweight mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and ultra notebooks and also increasingly are used in other end markets such as automotive, medical, and aerospace and defense. We collectively refer to these new technologies as &#147;advanced technologies,&#148; and they have growth rates that are typically higher than other PCB products that we refer to as &#147;conventional technologies&#148;. 

According to estimates in a November 2015 report by Prismark Partners LLC (Prismark Partners), worldwide demand for PCBs was approximately $56.4 billion in 2015, and worldwide PCB revenue is expected to increase at a rate of 2.0% in 2016. Of the worldwide demand for production in 2015, the Americas accounted for approximately 5% (approximately $3 billion), China accounted for approximately 47% (approximately $26.2 billion), and the rest of the world accounted for approximately 48% (approximately $27.3 billion), according to estimates by Prismark Partners. While Prismark Partners expects long-term growth to occur in all PCB technologies, they forecast more robust growth in the HDI, flexible and rigid-flex segments. This growth expectation stems from the increase in the number of applications that can utilize, and in many cases require, smaller, denser interconnects. 

The PCB manufacturing business is highly fragmented. According to a 2015 report by NTI, a PCB industry research firm, there were approximately 2,400 PCB manufacturers worldwide at the end of the first half of 2015, with the top 20 companies representing approximately 45% of the global market (by revenue) in 2014. As a result of global economic trends, the number of PCB producers operating in China has increased significantly since 2000. This corresponds with a significant decline in the number of North American and European PCB producers during the same time period. 

&#160; 

Industry Trends 

We believe that several trends are impacting the PCB manufacturing industry. These trends include: 

Shorter electronic product life cycles . Rapid advances in technology have shortened the life cycles of complex commercial electronic products, placing greater pressure on OEMs to quickly bring new products to market. The accelerated time-to-market and ramp-to-volume needs of OEMs for high-end commercial equipment create opportunities for PCB manufacturers that can offer engineering support in the prototype stage and manufacturing scalability throughout the production life cycle. 

Increasing complexity of electronic products . OEMs continue to design higher performance electronic products which take advantage of advances in semiconductor technology. In turn, this requires technologically complex PCBs that can accommodate higher speeds and component densities, often found in HDI, flexible, and substrate PCBs. These complex PCBs can also require very high layer counts, miniaturized circuit connections, advanced manufacturing processes and materials, and high-mix production capabilities, which involve processing small lots in a flexible manufacturing environment. 

Increasing concentration of global PCB production in Asia . In recent years, many electronics manufacturers have moved their commercial production to Asia to take advantage of its large and relatively lower cost labor pool and well-developed electronics infrastructure. In particular, the trend has favored China, which was expected to be the largest PCB market in terms of revenue in 2015 according to NTI. China has emerged as a global production center for cellular phones, smartphones, tablets, computers and computer peripherals, and high-end consumer electronics. According to Prismark Partners, approximately 91% of the world&#146;s PCB production for 2015 was estimated to come from Asia, in part due to proximity to the region&#146;s expansive electronic manufacturing operations. We believe that the expected continued concentration of consumer electronic production in China should result in additional commercial market share potential for PCB manufacturers with a strong presence and reputation in China. 

Decreased reliance on multiple PCB manufacturers by commercial OEMs . Commercial OEMs traditionally have relied on multiple PCB manufacturers to provide different services as an electronic product progresses through its life cycle. The physical transfer of a product among different PCB manufacturers often results in increased costs and inefficiencies due to potentially incompatible technologies and manufacturing processes, which results in production delays. In addition, commercial OEMs generally find it easier and less costly to manage fewer PCB manufacturers. As a result, commercial OEM and EMS providers often reduce the number of PCB manufacturers and providers on which they rely, presenting an opportunity for those that can offer one-stop manufacturing capabilities &#151; from prototype to volume production. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to be the leading global provider of time-critical, one-stop manufacturing services for highly complex PCBs. Our core strategy includes the following elements: 

Maintain our customer-driven culture and provide superior service to our customers in our core markets of networking communications, automotive, mobile devices, aerospace and defense and medical, industrial and instrumentation . Our customer-oriented culture is designed to achieve extraordinary service, competitive differentiation, and superior execution. Our customer-oriented strategies include engaging in co-development of new products, capturing new technology products for next generation equipment, and continuing to invest in and enhance our broad offering of PCB technologies. Our ability to anticipate and meet customers&#146; needs is critical to retaining existing customers and attracting leading companies as new customers. 

Drive operational efficiency and productivity . We are constantly focused on improving our operational execution to increase efficiency, productivity and yields. We strongly believe in the benefits of sharing best practices across our extensive manufacturing footprint and rely on stringent goals for throughput, quality and customer satisfaction to measure our effectiveness. The fast paced nature of our business requires a disciplined approach to manufacturing that is rooted in continuous improvement. 

Accelerate customer and end market diversification through strategic mergers and acquisitions . TTM has a history of successful acquisitions that have been key to our growth and profitability. We continuously look 

&#160; 

for strategic opportunities that could facilitate our efforts to diversify into other growing end markets including automotive and medical/industrial/instrumentation end markets. Our recent acquisition of Viasystems which has increased our diversification into automotive and medical/industrial/instrumentation end markets demonstrates our commitment to this strategy. 

Accelerate our expansion into the automotive and other growing markets using our advanced technology position to differentiate our operations . With rising requirements for faster data transmission, shrinking features ( i.e. , lightweight and thin), and lower power consumption, many PCB designs have migrated to more complex HDI PCBs from conventional multi-layer PCB technologies. This trend began with PCBs used in portable devices such as smartphones and tablets, but has become an increasing trend in other end markets, such as automotive, networking/communications, industrial, and aerospace and defense. We are focused in particular on the automotive opportunity where the Viasystems acquisition brings us strong market access to major automotive OEM part suppliers. The combination of the strength of Viasystems in highly reliable conventional PCBs and TTM&#146;s advanced technology PCBs meet our automotive customers&#146; growing demand in such areas as infotainment, radar systems for sensors, cameras for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and electric vehicles. As our customers consolidate their supply chain, our objective is to emerge as a supplier with the technology breadth to meet most or all of our automotive customers PCB requirements. 

Address customer needs in all stages of the product life cycle. By providing a one-stop solution, we work to service our customers&#146; needs from the earliest stages of product development through volume production. We believe that by servicing our customers early in the development process, we are able to demonstrate our capabilities and establish an incumbent position early in the product development cycle, which translates into additional opportunities as our customers move into volume production. Our expertise is enhanced by our ability to deliver highly complex PCBs to customers in significantly compressed lead times. This rapid delivery service enables OEMs to develop sophisticated electronic products more quickly and reduce their time to market. 

Deliver strong financial performance and delever the balance sheet. Our strategy is to be a company that delivers industry-leading financial performance. We expect to achieve this by servicing our customers&#146; needs in higher-growth end markets &#151; meeting their product needs in a cost-efficient and effective manner. We believe that this strategy will allow us to generate strong cash flows which will enable us to reduce financial leverage while at the same time providing us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business. 

Products and Services 

We offer a wide range of PCB products and electro-mechanical solutions, including HDI PCBs, conventional PCBs, flexible PCBs, rigid-flex PCBs, custom assemblies, and IC substrates. We also offer certain value-added services to support our customers&#146; needs. These include design for manufacturability (DFM), PCB layout design, simulation and testing services, and quick turnaround (QTA) services. By providing these value-added services to customers, we are able to provide our customers with a &#147;one-stop&#148; manufacturing solution, which enhances our relationships with our customers. 

Conventional PCBs 

A conventional PCB is made from a composite laminate that is metalized with a conductive material such as copper. The PCB becomes an electrical circuit when electronic components are attached to it. It is the basic platform used to interconnect components in most electronic products including computers, communications equipment, cellular phones, high-end consumer electronics, automotive controls and medical and industrial equipment. Conventional PCBs can be classified as single-sided, double-sided and multi-layer boards. 

We focus on high layer count conventional PCBs. A multi-layer PCB can accommodate more complex circuitry than a single-sided or double-sided PCB and as such requires more sophisticated production techniques. The number of layers comprising a PCB often increases with the complexity of the end product. For example, a simple consumer device such as a garage door controller may use a single-sided or double-sided PCB, while a high-end network router or computer server may use a PCB with 30 layers or more. 

&#160; 

High density interconnect or HDI PCBs 

Our facilities in North America and Asia Pacific can produce HDI PCBs, which are PCBs with higher interconnect density per unit area requiring more sophisticated technology and manufacturing processes for their production than conventional PCB products. HDI PCBs are boards with high-density characteristics including micro-sized holes, or microvias (diameter at or less than 0.15 mm), and may also include fine lines (circuit line width and spacing at or less than 0.075 mm) and fabricated with thin high performance materials, thereby enabling more interconnection functions per unit area. HDI PCBs generally are manufactured using a sequential build-up process in which circuitry is formed in the PCB one layer at a time through successive drilling, plating and lamination cycles. In general, a board&#146;s complexity is a function of interconnect and circuit density, layer count, laminate material type and surface finishes. As electronic devices have become smaller and more portable with higher functionality, demand for advanced HDI PCB products has increased dramatically. We define advanced HDI PCBs as those having more than one layer of microvia interconnection structure. 

Flexible PCBs 

Flexible PCBs are printed circuits produced on flexible films, allowing them to be folded or bent to fit the available space or allow relative movement. We manufacture circuits on flexible substrates that can be installed in three-dimensional applications for electronic packaging systems. Use of flexible circuitry can enable improved reliability, improved electrical performance, reduced weight and reduced assembly costs when compared with traditional wire harness or ribbon cable packaging. Flexible PCBs can provide flexible electronic connectivity of an electrical device&#146;s apparatus such as printer heads, cameras, camcorders, TVs, mobile handsets, and tablets. For some of our flexible PCB customers we also assemble components onto the flexible PCBs we manufacture. 

Rigid-flex PCBs 

Rigid-flex circuitry provides a simple means to integrate multiple PCB assemblies and other elements such as display, input or storage devices without wires, cables or connectors, replacing them with thin, light composites that integrate wiring in ultra-thin, flexible ribbons between rigid sections. In rigid-flex packaging, a flexible circuit substrate provides a backbone of wiring with rigid multilayer circuit sections built up as modules where needed. 

Since the ribbons can be bent or folded, rigid-flex provides a means to compactly package electronics in three dimensions with dynamic or static bending functions as required, enabling miniaturization and thinness of product design. The simplicity of rigid-flex integration also generally reduces the number of parts required, which can improve reliability. The increasing popularity of mobile electronics coupled with the design trend of developing increasingly thinner, lighter and more feature-rich products is expected to further drive growth in the rigid-flex and flex sector, where these PCBs are the backbone of miniaturization. 

Rigid-flex technology is essential to a broad range of applications including aerospace, industrial and transportation systems requiring high reliability; hand-held and wearable electronics such as mobile phones, video cameras and music players where thinness and mechanical articulation are essential; and ultra-miniaturized products such as headsets, medical implants and semiconductor packaging where size and reliability are paramount. 

Custom assemblies &#38; system integration 

Our assembly facilities produce custom electronic assemblies as well as fully integrated electronic systems. Custom electronic assemblies refer to a variety of PCB assemblies such as backplane and midplane assemblies, flexible and rigid-flex assemblies and RF assemblies. Each of these assemblies involves mounting electronic components to a printed circuit board and then testing the assembly for electrical continuity. Our services also go beyond the PCB assembly to fully integrated systems. A fully integrated system often includes installing the PCB assembly into a metal enclosure and adding fans for cooling the system, a power supply and cable assemblies to create a fully assembled and tested system that will be shipped to our customers. 

&#160; 

IC substrates 

IC substrates provide mechanical support and electrical interconnect for very small ICs (integrated circuits or semiconductors) and up to comparatively larger PCBs for assembly into electronic end products such as memory modules, cellular phones, digital cameras, automotive GPS and engine controls. IC substrates, also known as chip carriers, are highly miniaturized circuits manufactured by a process largely similar to that for PCBs but requiring the use of ultra-thin materials and including micron-scale features, because they must bridge the gap between sub-micron IC features and millimeter scale PCBs. Consequently, IC substrates are generally manufactured in a semiconductor-grade clean room environment to ensure products are free of defects and contamination. 

IC substrates are a basic component of IC packages which, combined with other electronic components in an assembly, control functions of an electronic appliance. IC packages can be broadly divided into single chip modules (or SCMs) and multi-chip modules (or MCMs), with the former containing one IC chip, and the latter containing multiple chips and other electronic components. 

Quick turnaround services 

We refer to our rapid delivery services as &#147;quick turnaround&#148; or &#147;QTA&#148;, because we provide custom-fabricated PCBs to our customers within as little as 24 hours to ten days. As a result of our ability to rapidly and reliably respond to the critical time requirements of our customers, we generally receive premium pricing for our QTA services as compared to standard lead time prices. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Prototype production. In the design, testing, and launch phase of a new electronic product&#146;s life cycle, our customers typically require limited quantities of PCBs in a very short period of time. We satisfy this need by manufacturing prototype PCBs in small quantities, with delivery times ranging from as little as 24 hours to ten days. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ramp-to-volume production. After a product has successfully completed the prototype phase, our customers introduce the product to the market and require larger quantities of PCBs in a short period of time. This transition stage between low-volume prototype production and volume production is known as ramp-to-volume. Our ramp-to-volume services typically include manufacturing up to a few hundred PCBs per order with delivery times ranging from five to 15 days. 

RF and microwave circuits 

We produce and test specialized circuits used in radio-frequency or microwave emission and collection applications. These products are typically used for radar, transmit/receive antennas and similar wireless applications. Markets for these products include automotive, defense, avionics, satellite, and commercial applications. The manufacture of these products requires advanced materials, equipment, and methods that are highly specialized and distinct from conventional printed circuit manufacturing techniques. We also offer specialized radio-frequency assembly and test services. 

Thermal management 

Increased component density on circuit boards often requires improved thermal dissipation to reduce operating temperatures. We produce printed circuits with heavy copper cores and both embedded and press-fit coins. In addition, we produce printed circuit boards with electrically passive heat sinks laminated externally on a circuit board or between two circuit boards, as well as printed circuit boards with electrically active thermal cores. 

Manufacturing Technologies 

The market for our products is characterized by rapidly evolving technology. In recent years, the trend in the electronic products industry has been to increase the speed, complexity, and performance of components while reducing their size. We believe our technological capabilities allow us to address the needs of manufacturers to bring complicated electronic products to market faster. 

&#160; 

To manufacture PCBs, we generally receive circuit designs directly from our customers in the form of computer data files, which we review to ensure data accuracy and product manufacturability. Processing these computer files with computer aided manufacturing (CAM) technology, we generate images of the circuit patterns that we then physically develop on individual layers, using advanced photographic processes. Through a variety of plating and etching processes, we selectively add and remove conductive materials to form horizontal layers of thin circuitry, which are separated by electrical insulating material. A multilayer circuit board is produced by laminating together multiple layers of circuitry, using intense heat and pressure under vacuum. Vertical connections between layers are achieved by drilling and plating through small holes, called vias. Vias are made by highly specialized drilling equipment capable of achieving extremely fine tolerances with high accuracy. We specialize in high layer count PCBs with extremely fine geometries and tolerances. Because of the tolerances involved, we employ clean rooms in certain manufacturing processes where tiny particles might otherwise create defects on the circuit patterns. We also use automated optical inspection systems and electrical testing systems to ensure consistent quality of the circuits we produce. 

We believe that our highly specialized equipment and advanced manufacturing processes enable us to reliably produce PCBs with the following characteristics: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; High layer count. Manufacturing PCBs with a large number of layers is difficult to accomplish due to the accumulation of manufacturing tolerances and registration systems required. In our PCB operating segment, we regularly manufacture PCBs with more than 30 layers on a quick-turn and volume basis. Approximately 13% of our 2015 PCB net sales involved the manufacture of PCBs with at least 18 layers or more, compared to 16% in 2014. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Blind and buried vias . Vias are drilled holes that provide electrical connectivity between layers of circuitry in a PCB. Blind vias connect the surface layer of the PCB to an internal layer and terminate at the internal layer. Buried vias are holes that do not reach either surface of the PCB but allow inner layers to be interconnected. Products with blind and buried vias can be made thinner, smaller, lighter and with higher component density and more functionality than products with traditional vias. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Microvias . HDI technology utilizes microvias, which are small vias with diameters generally less than 0.005 inches after plating. Advanced HDI products may also require the microvias to be fully filled using a specialized plating process so that additional microvia structures can be stacked on top to form more complex interconnections. These microvias consume much less space on the layers they interconnect, thereby providing for greater wiring densities and flexibility, and also providing closer spacing of components and their attachment pads. The fabrication of PCBs with microvias requires specialized equipment, such as laser drills, and highly developed process knowledge. Applications such as handheld wireless devices employ microvias to obtain a higher degree of functionality from a given surface area. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Embedded passives. Embedded passive technology involves embedding either the capacitive or resistive elements inside the PCB, which allows for removal of passive components from the surface of the PCB and thereby leaves more surface area for active components. Use of this technology provides greater surface area for surface-mounted ICs and better signal performance, as well as increased functionality of products with higher component density. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fine line traces and spaces. Traces are the connecting copper lines between the different components of the PCB, and spaces are the distances between traces. The smaller the traces and the tighter the spaces, the higher the density on the PCB and the greater the expertise required to achieve a desired final yield on an order. We are able to manufacture PCBs with traces and spaces less than 0.002 inches. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; High aspect ratios. The aspect ratio is the ratio between the thickness of the PCB and the diameter of a drilled hole. As the aspect ratio increases, it becomes difficult to reliably form, electroplate and finish all the holes on a PCB. In production, we are able to provide aspect ratios of up to 30:1. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Thin core processing. A core is the basic inner-layer building block material from which PCBs are constructed. A core consists of a flat sheet of material comprised of glass-reinforced resin with copper foil laminated on either side. The thickness of inner-layer cores is typically determined by the overall thickness of the PCB and the number of layers required. The demand for thinner cores derives from the 

&#160; 

&#160; requirements for thinner PCBs, higher layer counts and various electrical parameters. Core thickness in our PCBs ranges from as little as 0.002 inches up to 0.062 inches. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advanced hole fill process. Our advanced hole fill processes provide designers the opportunity to increase the density of component placements by reducing the surface area required to place many types of components. In traditional design, components are routed from their surface interfaces through via connections in order to access power and ground connections and the internal circuitry used to connect to other discrete components. Our advanced hole fill processes provide methods to allow for vias to be placed inside their respective surface mount pads by filling the vias with a thermoset epoxy and plating flat copper surface mount pads directly over the filled hole. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advanced materials . We manufacture circuit boards using a wide variety of advanced dielectric materials. These high-performance materials offer electrical, thermal, and long-term reliability advantages over conventional materials but are more difficult to manufacture. We are certified by Underwriters Laboratories to manufacture PCBs using many types and combinations of these specialty materials. This wide offering allows us to manufacture complex boards for niche and high-end commercial and aerospace and defense markets.

Our sales and marketing strategy focuses on building long-term relationships with our customers&#146; engineering and new product introduction personnel early in the product development phase, frequently through strategic account management teams. As the product moves from the prototype stage through ramp-to-volume and volume production, we shift our focus to the customers&#146; procurement departments in order to capture sales at each point in the product&#146;s life cycle. 

Our staff of engineers, sales support personnel, and managers assists our sales representatives in advising customers with respect to manufacturing feasibility, design review, and technological capabilities through direct communication and visits. We combine our sales efforts with customer service at each facility to better serve our customers. Each large customer is typically assigned an account manager to coordinate all of the company&#146;s services across all of our facilities. Additionally, the largest and most strategic customers are also supported by selected program management and engineering resources. Our global sales force is comprised of direct sales personnel, complemented by commission-based independent representatives, and supports customers throughout North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. 

Our domestic North America footprint comprises a significant amount of our PCB operating segment with sixteen PCB fabrication plants located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Ontario, Canada. The footprint includes a facility that provides follow-on value-added assembly services primarily to our Connecticut PCB fabrication plant; an outsourcing operation that provides brokered sourcing of lower cost, off-shore PCB companies as an additional option for our customers; and a custom electronic assembly facility in Mexico that is part of our E-M Solutions segment. As part of our integration strategy to improve total plant utilization, operational performance and customer focus following our recent acquisition of Viasystems, two domestic PCB fabrication plants and the custom electronic assembly plant in Mexico are scheduled to close during the first half of 2016. 

Our Asia Pacific footprint includes facilities from both our PCB and E-M Solutions operating segment with eight PCB fabrication plants located in Hong Kong, Huiyang, Dongguan, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Zhongshan China, and three custom assembly and system integration operations in Shanghai and Shenzhen China.

Suppliers 

The primary raw materials we use in PCB manufacturing include copper-clad laminate; chemical solutions such as copper and gold for plating operations; photographic film; carbide drill bits; and plastic for testing fixtures. Although we have preferred suppliers for some raw materials used in the manufacture of PCBs, most of our raw materials are generally readily available in the open market from numerous other potential suppliers. 

&#160; 

The primary raw materials we use in backplane assemblies and other PCB assemblies are manufactured components such as PCBs, connectors, capacitors, resistors, diodes and integrated circuits, many of which are custom made and controlled by our customers&#146; approved vendors. These components for backplane assemblies and other PCB assemblies in some cases have limited or sole sources of supply. For example, in some instances our customers will require us to use a specific component from a particular supplier or require us to use a component provided by the customer itself, in which case we may have a single or limited number of suppliers for these specific components. The backplane assemblies, PCB assemblies and precision metal fabricated chassis and enclosures produced by us may be incorporated into a fully integrated and tested system delivered to our customer. These products often incorporate procured power, thermal, interconnect and mechanical components sourced from customer directed or our selected suppliers. 

We typically use just-in-time procurement practices to maintain our raw materials inventory at low levels and work closely with our suppliers to obtain technologically advanced raw materials. In addition, we periodically seek alternative supply sources to ensure that we are receiving competitive pricing and service. Adequate amounts of all raw materials have been available in the past, and we believe this availability will continue into the foreseeable future. 

Competition 

Despite industry consolidation, the PCB industry remains fragmented and characterized by intense competition. Our principal PCB and substrate competitors include AT &#38; S Austria Technologie &#38; Systemtechnik AG, Chin Poon Industrial Co., LTD., Compeq Manufacturing Co., Ltd., IBIDEN Co., Ltd., ISU Petasys Co., Ltd., Multek Corporation, Sanmina Corporation, Tripod Technology Corp., Unimicron Technology Corp., and Wus Printed Circuit Co., Ltd. Our principal E-M Solutions competitors include Amphenol Corp, Flex, Jabil Circuit, Inc. and Sanmina Corporation. 

We believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; status as a top global PCB manufacturer; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; capability and flexibility to produce technologically complex products; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ability to offer a one-stop manufacturing solution; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; specialized and integrated manufacturing facilities; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ability to offer time-to-market capabilities; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; leading edge aerospace and defense capabilities; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; flexibility to manufacture low volume, high-mix products; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; consistent high-quality product; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; outstanding customer service. 

In addition, we believe our continuous evaluation and early adoption of new manufacturing and production technologies give us a competitive advantage. We believe that our ability to manufacture PCBs using advanced technologies, including our HDI, flexible PCBs and substrate capabilities, provides us with a competitive advantage over manufacturers that do not possess this advanced technological expertise. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain and enhance our manufacturing capabilities and production technologies. 

Seasonality 

As manufacturers of electronic components, orders for our products generally correspond to the production schedules of our customers. We historically experience higher net sales in the third and fourth quarters due to end customer demand in the fourth quarter for consumer electronics products. Seasonal fluctuations also include the Chinese New Year holidays in the first quarter, which typically results in lower net sales. We attribute this decline to shutdowns of our customers&#146; manufacturing facilities surrounding the Chinese New Year public holidays, which normally occur in January or February of each year. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

Backlog consists of purchase orders received, including, in some instances, demand agreements released for production under customer contracts. We obtain firm purchase orders from our customers for all products. However, for some of these purchase orders, customers do not make firm schedules for delivery more than 90 days in advance. Therefore, we measure backlog as orders with deliveries scheduled over the next 90 days. At December 28, 2015, total backlog was $365.8 million, compared with $201.0 million at the end of 2014. Substantially all backlog at December 28, 2015 is expected to be converted to sales in the first quarter of 2016. Additionally, we typically experience a higher amount of backlog in the second half of the year due to increased end customer demand for consumer electronics products in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with our seasonal patterns as discussed above. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe our business depends on the effectiveness of our fabrication techniques and our ability to continue to improve our manufacturing processes. We have limited patent or trade secret protection for our manufacturing processes. We rely on the collective experience of our employees in the manufacturing process to ensure that we continuously evaluate and adopt the new technologies available in our industry. In addition, we depend on training, recruiting, and retaining our employees, who are required to have sufficient know-how to operate advanced equipment and to conduct complicated manufacturing processes. 

National Security Matters 

A portion of our business consists of manufacturing defense and defense-related items for various departments and agencies of the U.S. government, including the U.S. Department of Defense, or the DoD, which requires that we maintain facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, or NISPOM. The NISPOM requires that a corporation with significant foreign ownership maintaining a facility security clearance take steps to mitigate foreign ownership, control or influence, referred to as &#147;FOCI.&#148; Pursuant to these laws and regulations, effective October 2010, we entered into a Special Security Agreement (SSA) with the DoD; Su Sih (BVI) Limited, or Su Sih (a significant foreign owner of our capital stock); and Mr. Tang Hsiang Chien (as the beneficial owner of Su Sih). The purpose of the SSA is to deny Mr. Tang, Su Sih, and other persons affiliated with our Asia Pacific operations, from unauthorized access to classified and export controlled unclassified information and to mitigate any influence over our business or management in a manner that could result in the compromise of classified information or could adversely affect the performance of classified contracts. 

Other Governmental Regulations 

Our operations, particularly those in North America, are subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements relating to export control, environmental compliance, waste management, and health and safety matters. In particular, we are subject to the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; U.S. Department of State regulations, including the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and International Traffic In Arms Regulations (ITAR) located at 22 CFR Parts 120-130; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; U.S. Department of Commerce regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) located at 15 CFR Parts 730-744; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) regulations located at 31 CFR Parts 500-599; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and state OSHA and Department of Labor laws pertaining to health and safety in the workplace; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations pertaining to air emissions; wastewater discharges; and the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing processes; the reporting of chemical releases to the environment; and the reporting of chemicals manufactured in by-products that are beneficially recycled; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Department of Homeland Security regulations regarding the storage of certain chemicals of interest; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; corresponding state laws and regulations, including site investigation and remediation; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; corresponding U.S. county and city agencies; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; corresponding regulations and agencies in China for our Chinese facilities; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; material content directives and laws that ban or restrict certain hazardous substances in products sold in member states of the European Union, China, other countries, and jurisdictions; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; SEC rules that require reporting of the use of certain metals from &#147;conflict minerals&#148; originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 9 countries surrounding it pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; reporting requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 that requires reporting on efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in retailers&#146; and manufacturers&#146; supply chains. 

The process to manufacture PCBs requires adherence to city, county, state, federal and foreign environmental regulations regarding the storage, use, handling and disposal of chemicals, solid wastes and other hazardous materials, as well as compliance with air quality standards and chemical use reporting. We believe that our facilities in the United States comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. In China, governmental authorities are taking various steps to tighten the rules and regulations governing environmental issues. An update to Chinese environmental waste water law was issued in late 2012, allowing for an interim period in which plants subject to such law may install equipment that meets the new regulatory regime. Our plants in China are not yet in full compliance with the current environmental regulations. We believe we have developed plans acceptable to the Chinese government, and we are in the process of implementing these plans. We do not anticipate any immediate risk of government fines or temporary closure of Chinese plants. We have established and enacted an investment plan related to the efforts to come into full compliance with the new regulations. There can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future. 

Employees 

As of December 28, 2015, we had approximately 29,570 employees. Of our employees, approximately 27,100 were involved in manufacturing and engineering, 640 worked in sales and marketing, and approximately 1,830 worked in accounting, systems and other support capacities. None of our U.S. employees are represented by unions. In China, approximately 11,250 employees are members of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and accordingly are considered to be represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any labor problems resulting in a work stoppage, except for a work stoppage associated with the announcement of the closure of our Suzhou, China facility in 2013, and we believe that we have good relations with our employees.
