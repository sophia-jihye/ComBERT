General Overview. 

&#160;

Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;, &#147;we&#148; or &#147;us&#148;), is a software development company headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, with an office in Mitchell, South Dakota. We specialize in creating interface and application solutions for speech recognition technologies. Our speech recognition software and related firmware was first introduced in 1994 at an industry trade show. We currently have limited capital resources. We are not currently engaged in marketing any products. We have increased our efforts to monetize our assets. We are currently engaged in discussions with certain firms dedicated to assisting in the commercialization of intellectual assets. 

&#160;

Our principal assets are our patents. We currently hold five issued patents. Our first patent, U.S. Patent #5,960,447 entitled &#147;Word Tagging and Editing System for Speech Recognition,&#148; included 42 claims covering what we believed was an extremely broad base of features applicable to existing ASR products and markets, and expired on November 13, 2015. Our second patent, U.S. Patent #7,558,730 entitled &#147;Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols&#148; discloses a system for facilitating speech recognition and transcription among users employing incompatible protocols for generating, transcribing and exchanging speech. Our third patent U.S. Patent #7,949,534, entitled &#147;Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,&#148; is an expansion of the coverage of our second patent and incorporates speech recognition and transcription among transcription engines employing incompatible protocols. Our fourth patent U.S. Patent #8,131,557, entitled &#147;Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,&#148; is an expansion of the coverage of AVRS&#146;s second and third patents and incorporates speech recognition and transcription among transcription engines employing incompatible protocols for generating, transcribing, and exchanging speech among users employing incompatible protocols utilizing peer-to-peer networks, node-to-node networks, and the cloud. Our fifth patent, U.S. Patent #8,498,871, entitled &#147;Dynamic Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,&#148; is a system for facilitating free form dictation, including directed dictation and constrained recognition and /or structured transcription among users having heterogeneous protocols for generating, transcribing and exchanging recognized and transcribed speech. Our sixth patent, U.S. Patent #9,142,217, entitled &#147;Dynamic Speech Recognition and Transcription Among Users Having Heterogeneous Protocols,&#148; is an expansion of the coverage of our fifth patent. Our business strategy is to attempt to interest other companies in entering into license agreements or other strategic relationships and to enforce and defend our patents through infringement and interference proceedings, as appropriate. 

&#160;

&#160; Industry Overview 

&#160;

We believe that speech recognition technology has a multitude of potential applications including but not limited to dictation and transcription, mobile messaging (voice to texting), server based web search, customer relations and translation. 

&#160;

Speech recognition technology, which provides for the conversion of speech into written text, is the threshold feature of our solutions. Our technology focuses on improving speech recognition technology by increasing speech conversion precision, with the goal of achieving near 100% accuracy and allowing the user to speak naturally. We also focus on improving user productivity and profitability by enabling the user to effectively utilize the written text produced by speech recognition technology (the End-Text) in multiple applications specific to the user&#146;s business purposes and goals. 

&#160;

We believe our main competitors are Microsoft, Nuance, Google Voice and Apple. We also compete, and anticipate that we will compete, with several smaller niche suppliers. 

&#160;

Principal Proposed Products or Services 

&#160;

We have not achieved any revenues from product sales. In addition, we will need substantial additional capital to achieve our marketing objectives as described below. 

&#160;

Speech Recognition Software and Related Firmware 

&#160;

Our principal proposed product is speech recognition software and related firmware which allows for dictation into a broad range of applications, including DOS applications running in Windows, UNIX and mainframe applications accessed through terminal emulation programs, various custom applications , and all Windows 3.x, 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista and Windows 7 programs. Through this product, we seek to provide full functionality including audio proofreading, deferred and delegated correction and additional capabilities that we believe are not available with other products. This product is designed to allow for deferred dictation, where the text is saved with the associated audio, and the users can resume when stopped and can play back dictated content. Similarly, the recognized text and associated audio can be saved to be used when text is corrected. 

&#160;

AVRS Enterprise Solutions 

&#160;

AVRS patented technology is applicable to many main stream speech enabled applications ranging from traditional desktop applications to mobile and web-based solutions. The technology reaches beyond simple speech recognition and transcription into many other applications thus enabling the exchange of spoken text transcription amongst numerous users on diverse system platforms, as well as enabling the transcribed text to be utilized by many interface applications. The key is the recognition of, and in many cases the transcription of, spoken text in a myriad of applications to allow a seamless interface among users and /or systems having disparate protocols. Recognition of dictated speech including spoken text and commands, over many platforms provides operations of systems having diverse requirements and capabilities. 

&#160;

AVRS patents cover both a method of implementation and a system whereby speech recognition and transcription can be operated upon and exchanged amongst users employing disparate legacy protocols through one or more transaction managers having a systems protocol. An underlying key factor in all AVRS patented technology lies in its enabling capability whereby any legacy application protocol can be made compatible with speech recognition and transcription engines with or without modification of the application or the protocol upon which the initiating or the receiving application relies. 

&#160;

Market 

&#160;

We believe that our patented technology has applications in vertical markets that require individuals and organizations to create reports, letters, e-mail, data entry, manuals, books, and virtually any other document or end product involving written data. These organizations include corporations, hospitals, medical product and service providers, governmental entities, legal professionals, sales and service organizations law enforcement agencies and mobile search and voicemail to text. 

&#160;

Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) 

&#160;

We believe that our patented technology has applications in OEM markets, targeting both software developers and hardware manufacturers. When we have sufficient available resources, we may approach the larger OEM companies with a joint marketing approach strategy while using a direct sale basis to approach small and medium-sized OEMs. 

&#160;

&#160;

Hardware Manufacturers 

&#160;

We believe that our patented technology has applications in hardware manufacturing, and to that end, when we have sufficient available resources, we may approach hardware manufacturers both on a direct basis and through joint sales and marketing programs. We anticipate that we will offer technology and patent licenses to manufacturers of medical devices, digital dictation systems, recorders, workstation PCs, mobile phones, PDAs, WAPs, and intelligent electronics. Alternatively, we may offer these manufacturers limited versions of our speech recognition software and related firmware product line for embedding into hardware. When we have sufficient available resources, we expect to develop joint sales and marketing programs for mainframe, thin-client, telephony and other large hardware processing systems. 

&#160;

Distribution 

&#160;

Product development of the speech recognition software and related firmware was our primary focus for the first six years following the software&#146;s introduction into the software market in 1994. Early forms of the speech recognition software and related firmware were marketed through a network of approximately 200 small dealers specializing in speech recognition technology. We no longer are focused on product development and instead are focusing on commercializing our existing intellectual property assets. 

&#160;

Our business model has been revised and we plan to collect royalty payments based on actual usage of the speech recognition software and related firmware in various applications. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our primary assets are U.S. Patent #7,558,730, U.S. Patent #7,949,534, U.S. Patent #8,131,557, U.S. Patent #8,498,871, and U.S. Patent #9,142,217. U.S. Patent #5,960,447, our first patent, was for a word tagging and editing system for speech recognition, was filed on November 13, 1995 and issued on September 28, 1999. In accordance with 35 U.S.C. 154, the term for U.S. Patent #5,960,447 began on September 28, 1999 and ended 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States, or November 13, 2015. 

&#160;

A word tagging and editing system for speech recognition receives recognized speech text from a speech recognition engine, and creates tagging information that follows the speech text as it is received by a word processing program or other program. The body of text to be edited in connection with the word processing program may be selected and cut and pasted and otherwise manipulated, and the tags follow within the audio data file created initially by the speech recognition engine. The sound bite may be replayed to the user through a speaker. The practical results include that the user may confirm the correctness of a particular recognized word, in real time whilst editing text in the word processor. If the recognition is manually corrected, the correction information may be supplied to the engine for use in updating a user profile for the user who dictated the audio that was recognized. Particular tagging approaches are employed depending on the particular word processor or other program being used. 

&#160;
