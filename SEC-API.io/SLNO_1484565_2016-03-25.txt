BUSINESS 

Company Overview 

We are a diversified healthcare company that develops and commercializes innovative diagnostics, devices and therapeutics addressing unmet medical needs. Our first commercial product, CoSense End-Tidal Carbon Monoxide (ETCO) Monitor, aids in the detection of excessive hemolysis, a condition in which red blood cells degrade rapidly. When present in neonates with jaundice, hemolysis is a dangerous condition which can lead to adverse neurological outcomes. CoSense is 510(k) cleared for sale in the U.S. and received CE Mark certification for sale in the E.U. 

On September 8, 2015, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary NeoForce, Inc., or NFI, acquired substantially all of the assets of NeoForce Group, Inc., or NeoForce. As a result of this acquisition, we also develop and market innovative pulmonary resuscitation solutions for the inpatient and ambulatory neonatal markets. NFI&#8217;s primary product is the NeoPip T-piece resuscitator and related consumable, which delivers consistent pre-set inspiratory pressure and positive end-expiratory pressures. Other products include temperature probes, scales, surgical tables and patient surfaces. 

Our therapeutic technology involves the use of precisely metered nasal carbon dioxide, or CO 2 , for the potential relief of symptoms related to various diseases. Several randomized placebo controlled trials have shown its efficacy in the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinitis, and we continue to evaluate our options to further develop this product. In addition, we are pursuing new initiatives for the development of this technology for the treatment of trigeminally-mediated pain disorders such as cluster headache and trigeminal neuralgia, or TN. In December 2015, we were granted orphan drug designation for our nasal, non-inhaled CO 2 &#32;technology for the treatment of TN. We have filed an investigational new drug, or IND, application with the U.S Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and started enrolling TN patients in a pilot clinical trial in 2016. 

Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on additional products based on our Sensalyze Technology Platform, a portfolio of proprietary methods and algorithms which enables CoSense and can be applied to detect a variety of analytes in exhaled breath, as well as other products for the neonatology market. Our current development pipeline includes proposed diagnostic devices for asthma in children, assessment of blood CO 2 &#32;concentration in neonates and malabsorption. We may also license elements of our Sensalyze Technology Platform to other companies that have complementary development or commercial capabilities. 

Approximately 143 million babies are born annually worldwide, with approximately 9.2 million of these born in the U.S. and E.U. Over 60% of neonates present with jaundice at some point in the first five days of life. We believe CoSense has the potential to become a widely used tool, by aiding in the detection of hemolysis in newborns that present with, or are at risk of developing, jaundice. Red blood cell breakdown, referred to as hemolysis, is a normal phenomenon but in certain situations the breakdown is accelerated or is excessive, and is referred to as hemolysis. The most common cause of hospital readmission during the neonatal phase is jaundice, and we expect that CoSense may help reduce such readmissions. Many causes of jaundice do not represent a significant health threat. However, when severe jaundice occurs in the presence of hemolysis, rapid detection and treatment may be necessary for infants to avoid life-long neurological impairment or other disability. Also, unnecessary treatment increases hospital expenses, is stressful for both infant and parents and may increase morbidity. There is an unmet need, therefore, for more accurate detection of hemolysis, particularly for a test that is non-invasive, rapid, and easy to use. Currently, hemolysis is detected via a variety of blood tests, which are limited in their diagnostic accuracy and suffer from other drawbacks, including the need for painful blood draws and a waiting period for results. CoSense detects hemolysis by measuring carbon monoxide, or CO, in the portion of the exhaled breath that originates from the deepest portion of the lung. This is referred to as the end-tidal component of the breath, and the measurement we perform with CoSense is referred to as end-tidal carbon monoxide, or ETCO. This measurement is typically reported after being corrected for ambient CO levels, and is referred to as ETCOc. Throughout this document, ETCO refers to ETCOc levels. The American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP, guidelines published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004 recommend ETCO measurement be performed to assess the presence of hemolysis in neonates requiring phototherapy, neonates unresponsive to phototherapy or readmitted for phototherapy and neonates with bilirubin levels approaching transfusion levels. Because CO is a direct byproduct of hemolysis, ETCO can measure the rate of bilirubin production from hemolysis. However, until the availability of CoSense, no device was commercially available for accurately measuring the ETCO levels associated with the rate of hemolysis in clinical practice in neonates. As a result, we believe that CoSense is the only device on the market that enables physicians to practice in accordance with the AAP guidelines when evaluating jaundiced neonates for potential treatment. Physicians are free to practice in accordance with their own judgment; however, we believe that the current AAP guidelines will be a significant factor in the adoption of CoSense. 

Commercial activities for CoSense commenced in 2015. In January of 2016, we entered into a distribution agreement with Bemes, Inc., or Bemes, a leading medical equipment m aster distributor, to market and distribute the CoSense and our consumable Precision Sampling Sets, or PSS. Under the terms of the agreement, Bemes will have the exclusive right for sales, marketing, distribution and field service activities for CoSense in the U.S. Bemes and its network of sub-distributors will allow nationwide distribution of CoSense with 44 sales representatives covering almost every state. 

While our efforts will continue to focus on establishing an installed base of devices and building physician support for the device, we expect sales of the consumable PSS to be the largest component of our revenue over time. An electronic interface between the device and the PSS requires one-time use of our PSS, which also promotes good hygiene and is necessary to preserve the accuracy of the device. 

Our therapeutic technology consists of the use of nasal, non-inhaled CO 2 &#32;for the treatment of the symptoms of allergy, as well as pain associated with migraine, cluster headache and TN. Serenz, our allergy therapeutic product candidate, is a treatment for symptoms related to AR, which, when triggered by seasonal allergens, is commonly known as hay fever or seasonal allergies. Several Phase 2 clinical trials have been completed in which Serenz showed statistically significant improvements in total nasal symptom scores, or TNSS, in symptomatic patients when compared to controls. AR is typically an episodic disorder with intermittent symptoms. However, there is no treatment currently available that provides truly rapid relief of symptoms, other than topical decongestants, which can have significant side effects. The more optimal therapeutic for an episodic disorder is one that will treat symptoms when they occur, and can therefore be taken only as needed. We believe that Serenz has an ideal profile for an as-needed therapeutic for AR and may provide advantages over regularly dosed, slow to act currently marketed products. 

We recently reactivated the CE Mark certification for Serenz. We plan to move forward with pilot sales of Serenz to pharmacies in the E.U. during the second quarter of 2016 to gather commercial feedback in preparation of a possible full launch of Serenz later in 2016. 

We have entered into a collaboration agreement with Clinvest, a research organization dedicated to the advancement of medicine and health through clinical research, in order to develop a therapeutic product for the treatment of cluster headaches. Cluster headaches are characterized by recurring bouts of excruciating pain in one side of the head. 

In December, 2015, we were granted orphan drug designation for our nasal, non-inhaled CO 2 &#32;technology for the treatment of TN. We have filed an IND for TN with the FDA and started enrolling TN subjects in a pilot clinical trial in 2016. 

CoSense 

CoSense, our first Sensalyze Technology Platform product to receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA and CE Mark certification. CoSense measures ETCO, which can be elevated due to endogenous causes such as excessive breakdown of red blood cells, or hemolysis, or exogenous causes such as CO poisoning and smoke inhalation. Our first target market is for the detection of hemolysis in neonates, a disorder in which CO and bilirubin are produced in excess as byproducts of the breakdown of red blood cells. Hemolysis can place neonates at high risk for hyperbilirubinemia and resulting neurodevelopmental disability. The AAP recommends the use of ETCO monitoring to evaluate neonates for hemolysis, but, other than CoSense, there is no device currently on the market for physicians to effectively monitor ETCO in clinical practice. 

Hemolysis and Bilirubin 

We estimate that approximately one third of the 9.2 million newborns in the U.S. and E.U. each year are at risk for hemolysis under current practice, representing approximately 3.1 million newborns. We believe that many of these newborns are tested for hemolysis, but using relatively inaccurate and/or invasive diagnostic methods. Retrospective analysis of data, including data from over 54,000 newborns compiled by the Collaborative Perinatal Project sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, suggests that the only factor that predisposes newborns with jaundice to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes is the concurrent presence of hemolysis. Hemolysis can be caused by a number of factors, including physical trauma and bruising, blood group incompatibility, autoimmune disorders, and genetic causes such as sickle cell disease and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme deficiency. Because bilirubin is the chemical byproduct of the destruction of hemoglobin within red blood cells, hemolysis causes bilirubin production to spike. Bilirubin is yellow in color, and if present in excessive amounts in the body, known as hyperbilirubinemia, it can be deposited in tissues such as the skin and conjunctiva. The condition manifests as a yellowing of skin and conjunctiva and is called jaundice. Elevated levels of bilirubin are particularly dangerous to neonates, who have immature livers and lack the adult ability to excrete bilirubin. Neonates also lack a well-formed blood-brain barrier to prevent bilirubin from entering the central nervous system, or CNS, where bilirubin is known to be toxic to neuronal tissue. 

Adverse Effects of Jaundice and Hyperbilirubinemia 

Every year approximately 143 million babies are born world-wide, of which 4.0 million are in the U.S. and 5.2 million in the E.U. It is estimated that up to 60% of term neonates and 80% of preterm neonates may have jaundice. Most neonates have 

non-pathologic jaundice, which is often related to a decreased capacity of the neonate to excrete bilirubin into the intestinal tract for elimination from the body. These neonates will often normalize their bilirubin levels without a need for treatment. When treatment is required, it is usually via phototherapy, which typically involves isolating the baby in a chamber that directs blue-wavelength light to the baby&#8217;s skin. The light penetrates the skin and breaks down bilirubin via a photochemical reaction over a period of several hours. When treatment is performed in a timely fashion, adverse outcomes can be avoided. Some neonates with jaundice, however, will develop adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes related to hyperbilirubinemia if not properly treated. 

According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, neonatal jaundice is the single largest cause for hospital readmission of neonates in the U.S. This results in inefficient care and can also be highly stressful and disruptive for the parents and neonate. 

Exposure to excess bilirubin in the central nervous system as a result of hyperbilirubinemia is toxic and may cause long-term developmental disabilities. These abnormalities may be subtle, and include hearing problems and low IQ. Subtle forms of disability are known as Bilirubin-Induced Neurological Dysfunction, or BIND. More severe bilirubin-induced disabilities, including respiratory failure and resulting death, can be referred to as Acute Bilirubin Encephalopathy, or ABE. Bilirubin toxicity can ultimately result in a chronic, severe, and disabling condition called kernicterus. Kernicterus is a cerebral palsy-like condition in which the patient lacks muscle tone and motor control, cannot operate self-sufficiently, and typically requires long-term care. The National Quality Forum has in the past described kernicterus as a &#8220;never event,&#8221; one which physicians should ensure never occurs in their practice. 

Limitations of Current Diagnostic Methods 

It has been reported in peer-reviewed publications that the presence of hemolysis in a neonate with jaundice is a predictor of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. If neonates with high rates of hemolysis could be identified before they are discharged from the hospital, treatment could begin earlier, exposure to excessive bilirubin would be minimized and readmissions for jaundice would be reduced. Prior to the introduction of CoSense accurate tools for diagnosing hemolysis in neonates were not available in the market. Tests that are commonly done to assess hemolysis such as serial hematocrit levels, reticulocyte counts, Coombs test and peripheral smear, are all invasive blood tests and are less useful in neonates due to physiologic changes resulting from childbirth. For example, hematocrit levels and reticulocyte counts may be elevated in neonates unrelated to pathological conditions and may therefore confound the diagnosis of hemolysis, which typically involves low hematocrit and high reticulocyte counts. The Coombs test, a blood test that detects antibodies that can cause hemolysis, is used extensively as a measure of hemolysis; however, it often requires a painful heel stick to draw a blood sample, and other conditions besides hemolysis may trigger a false positive or false negative Coombs test. In spite of these limitations, we believe that the Coombs test remains the most frequently used diagnostic for hemolysis by physicians. 

Today, the AAP recommends that all neonates be routinely tested for bilirubin levels at some point prior to being discharged from the hospital, although other organizations such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF, have not made similar recommendations. In many hospitals this is done via a blood test, although transcutaneous bilirubin meters are now available to test bilirubin levels non-invasively through the skin. Inaccurate results with use of these devices have been reported based on serum bilirubin level, measurement site, race, and ethnicity. In addition, bilirubin levels reflect only a point in time rather than the rate of increase, and therefore, may not address the risk of subsequent adverse outcomes. These tests do not capture the rate of bilirubin production or the presence/absence of hemolysis, leaving the physician uncertain as to the patient&#8217;s level of risk. Since many babies have bilirubin levels in a zone described as &#8220;intermediate risk&#8221; by current treatment guidelines, it is difficult for physicians to decide whether to treat aggressively or more conservatively. 

Phototherapy is widely used to treat jaundice, and is applied to approximately 8% of all births in the U.S. However, phototherapy treatment disrupts the opportunity for parent-newborn bonding and is often highly stressful for infants and new parents. In some cases, particularly among low-risk newborns who are jaundiced, but not hemolyzing, phototherapy may not be necessary. In other cases, observation of jaundice and early testing for hemolysis may accelerate diagnosis and treatment with phototherapy. In all cases, understanding the rate of hemolysis is a critical part of providing timely and effective care. There is a significant need for a test to aid in the detection of hemolysis that is rapid, accurate, and easy to use across all acuity levels within neonatal care. 

Also, neonates are typically discharged from the hospital at approximately 48 hours of normal birth in U.S. hospitals are under pressure to discharge even earlier, in order to reduce costs and manage inpatient capacity. Bilirubin levels, however, typically peak more than 72 hours post birth. We believe that neonates with hemolysis can experience bilirubin levels in the intermediate risk range at time of discharge, but can spike rapidly to neurotoxic levels in the post-discharge period, out of the range expected based on the &#8220;Bhutani nomogram.&#8221; 

Physicians need to identify the cause of the jaundice and, based upon these findings, determine whether the infant is at serious risk for BIND, ABE, or kernicterus. However, physicians often have a diagnostic dilemma as to what is causing the jaundice. It is often not possible, with current diagnostic techniques and clinical workflow, to test whether it is merely a physiologic jaundice that poses little risk, or some other process that presents a serious risk to the neonate. Risk arises primarily from the presence of hemolysis, which leads to hyperbilirubinemia that persists rather than resolving spontaneously. As a result of the serious consequences of hyperbilirubinemia, the AAP recommends that all neonates be closely monitored for jaundice, and has called for physicians to determine the presence or absence of hemolysis in order to make appropriate treatment decisions. As a result, there are both clinical need and physician interest in the development of accurate and non-invasive methods for detecting hemolysis. CoSense addresses this need to measure a baby&#8217;s exhaled CO to assess the rate of hemolysis accurately, and does so via a non-invasive measurement at the point-of-care. CoSense delivers results within minutes, which may enable more timely treatment than the current standard of care. 

CoSense: FDA 510(k) Clearance and CE Mark Certification 

CoSense, our first Sensalyze Technology Platform product to receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA and CE Mark certification, is a monitor of ETCO. CO is a direct byproduct of hemolysis, and based on extensive published data such as that from Stanford University, the rate of bilirubin production can be measured by analyzing the concentration of CO in a neonate&#8217;s exhaled breath. 

CoSense is a point-of-care device that consists of a light-weight, portable monitoring device and a single-use nasal cannula (Precision Sampling Set or PSS). The PSS is placed just inside the nostril of the patient and is connected to the device. The CoSense device is turned on and acquires the breath signal while the patient breathes. Appropriate sample acquisition takes an average of 30 seconds. The PSS can then be removed from the patient and the device takes another four minutes to report the test result. 

The AAP recommends the use of ETCO monitoring for the detection of hemolysis. We believe ETCO monitoring will enable more rapid and appropriate treatment decisions and reduce overall costs of patient care. However, there is currently no device on the market other than CoSense that effectively measures ETCO in neonates. 

With CoSense data, physicians may be able to quickly identify neonates with jaundice who are at risk of adverse neurological outcomes or other disability due to a high rate of hemolysis. The physician may then initiate earlier treatments for jaundice, such as phototherapy, when necessary. We believe the potential impact of CoSense should result in reduced neurodevelopmental abnormalities in neonates. In addition, CoSense may also help identify neonates who do not have excessive hemolysis, and therefore may not require phototherapy or serial bilirubin measurements. As a result, these neonates may be discharged from the hospital earlier, or with less intensive clinical follow-up. We believe this will reduce the total number of blood draws that are necessary. We also believe this will reduce the rate of readmissions, resulting in significant cost savings for the hospital. 

CoSense has the following advantages that we believe will drive its adoption by hospitals, other medical institutions and physicians: 

&#8226; 

rapid administration at the point-of-care, yielding results in approximately five minutes; 

&#8226; 

non-invasive and minimally disruptive to the neonate; 

&#8226; 

no requirement for specific breath maneuver; 

&#8226; 

simple user interface that allows the healthcare professional to use it correctly with minimal training; 

&#8226; 

no on-site calibration necessary; and 

&#8226; 

accuracy and precision over a range of CO concentrations clinically relevant (less than 10 parts per million, or ppm, with 0.1ppm resolution) to detect the rate of hemolysis. 

In addition, we believe the CoSense device is priced at a level that falls below the typical capital equipment purchasing threshold for a hospital or other medical institution in the U.S. 

Clinical Trials 

Seven investigator-sponsored clinical trials have been performed to validate the ability of CoSense to detect the presence of hemolysis. Four of these were performed in neonates. One was performed in neonates and children up to 17 years old. Two were performed in children with sickle cell anemia, or SCA, a disease which results in chronic hemolysis. 

In a pilot clinical trial at Stanford University, a bench to bedside evaluation of CoSense was undertaken to identify hemolysis in neonates, and to correlate ETCO levels with bilirubin production as defined by levels of carboxyhemoglobin, or COHb, in the blood. When red blood cells are broken down, the pigment heme is released from the red blood cells. In turn, when heme is broken down, CO and biliverdin are produced in equimolar amounts. Biliverdin is a precursor of bilirubin, and is converted into bilirubin. CO combines with hemoglobin in the blood with high affinity to form carboxyhemoglobin, or COHb. Therefore, the level of COHb provides an accurate measurement of bilirubin production, or hemolysis. CO from COHb is released when the blood circulates through the lungs and as a result, levels of ETCO correlates to levels of COHb, bilirubin production and hemolysis. For accurate measurements of low levels of CO, gas chromatography is the method of choice. 

In bench studies, inter-device accuracy and intra-device imprecision were evaluated in three different CoSense devices. In the clinical setting, 83 neonates who all had a gestational age, or GA, of more than 30 weeks and had birth weights of at least 1500 grams were tested. ETCO measurements, in triplicate, were compared to COHb levels measured by gas chromatography in the subset of 24 of the 83 neonates who consented to testing for COHb and were suspected of having hemolysis. Gas chromatography is a technique better suited to the laboratory than to high-volume clinical use, particularly in the point-of-care neonatal diagnostic setting. It requires a large, complicated chromatography instrument and highly trained staff. 

A strong linear correlation between COHb and ETCO was seen (r= 0.93), confirming that ETCO values with CoSense accurately measure bilirubin production and therefore hemolysis. The results of this study were published in an article titled, &#8220;Evaluation of a new end-tidal carbon monoxide monitor from the bench to the bedside,&#8221; in Acta Paediatrica 2015. 

The ability of CoSense to identify hemolysis in neonates with significant hyperbilirubinemia was evaluated at The Children&#8217;s Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine in Hangzhou, China. Significant hyperbilirubinemia was defined as total serum bilirubin, TSB, levels that require phototherapy according to AAP guidelines. Investigators compared ETCO, as measured with CoSense, with current blood tests for hemolysis, such as hematocrit, or Hct, which measures the number of red blood cells, reticulocyte count, or Retic, which measures new red cell production levels, serum bilirubin test, and the Coombs Test. While these tests are often performed to detect hemolysis in neonates, they are not considered to be reliable in 

the neonatal setting. The information that is gained from a combination of all these tests is therefore used to inform a determination of the presence or absence of hemolysis. Certain tests may be better than others for a given type of hemolysis, whereas ETCO levels are elevated due to hemolysis regardless of the cause. 

Fifty-six neonates with significant hyperbilirubinemia participated in this non-randomized open-label trial. These data from the study showed that ETCO measurement with CoSense can provide the physician with similar information to that currently provided by invasive blood tests regarding the patient&#8217;s hemolytic status, but with a simple, non-invasive breath test. 

In a clinical trial at Children&#8217;s Hospital &#38; Research Center in Oakland, California, ETCO concentration was measured in children with SCA, who are known to have chronic hemolysis, using CoSense. Children between five and fourteen years old with SCA, who were not on regular transfusions, were eligible to participate in the trial. Children with exposure to second-hand smoke, acute respiratory infection or symptomatic asthma were excluded. Healthy children between five and fourteen years old served as matched controls. Up to three measurements were taken for each subject using CoSense, and the highest ETCO value was used. One control subject had a high ETCO value and was excluded from the analysis since the subject was found to have asthma and was on anti-epileptic medication. The data from this trial showed that CoSense may be useful to monitor the rate of hemolysis in children with SCA. This results from this study were published in an article titled, &#8220;Point-of-care end-tidal carbon monoxide reflects severity of hemolysis in sickle cell anemia,&#8221; in Pediatric Blood &#38; Cancer 2015. 

Recently, another clinical trial was conducted at Children&#8217;s Hospital &#38; Research Center in Oakland, California and UCSF Benioff Children&#8217;s Hospital, in sickle cell disease, or SCD, subjects ages 2 to18 years old and age-matched controls to validate the accuracy of a CoSense device that had an extended temperature operating range and to determine if the modified device could differentiate between children with sickle cell disease and healthy controls. Eleven SCD subjects and ten healthy age-matched controls were enrolled. The mean ETCO for SCD subjects was statistically significant. Thus, this study showed that the modified CoSense device provided a reliable detection of hemolysis in the sickle cell subjects. Capnia would like to continue to develop this modified device to be used as a screening tool in countries with limited resources, the greatest amount of SCD births and where early mortality due to SCD is observed. 

A study of 20 neonates and children with known hemolytic disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis or pyruvate kinase deficiency, and 20 age-matched controls was conducted to compare ETCO measurements at Intermountain Healthcare Institutions in Utah (McKay-Dee NICU, McKay-Dee Pediatric Clinics, McKay-Dee Perinatal Research Outpatient Service, and Primary Children&#8217;s Hospital Hematology Clinic). The known hemolytic disorders subjects were required to have a hemoglobin (Hbg) at least 10 g/dL based on lab tests performed in the last six months and confirmed within six weeks prior to breath sample collection. Neither group of subjects were to have had a blood cell transfusion within four weeks prior to breath sample 

collection. One ETCOc measurement was collected from each subject. Twelve out of the infants and children enrolled in each group (24 out of 40) were less than 1 year of age at the time of the ETCO measurement. Of these 12 subjects, seven were less than 1 month old at the time of the ETCO measurement (14 out of 40). The ETCO values of the 20 neonates and children with hemolytic diseases were higher than 20 age-matched controls. Thus, this study may show that CoSense can detect the differences in the rate of hemolysis between neonates and children who have known hemolytic anemia and healthy age-matched neonates and children. 

In a separate study at Intermountain Healthcare Institutions, ETCO was measured in 30 healthy, term (at least 37 weeks gestational age) newborns within the first hours after birth and again just before discharge from to home to quantify the rate of hemolysis during the first days of life. Testing was 100% successful, whether newborns were awake or asleep. The 95% confidence intervals were 1.4 to 1.7 ppm. No differences were seen in ETCO values between neonates born vaginally versus by Cesarean section, nor between those whose mothers received pitocin during labor or did not receive pitocin to augment labor. This suggests that the hemolysis was not the result of bruising during delivery. This study provides further evidence that low-grade hemolysis occurs normally in the first days after birth. 

The results of these two studies were published in an article titled, &#8220;End-tidal carbon monoxide as an indicator of hemolytic rate,&#8221; in Blood Cells, Molecules and Diseases 2015. 

In another study conducted at Intermountain Healthcare Institutions, ETCO was measured in 100 neonates with a total bilirubin greater than the 75 th &#32;percentile on the Bhutani nomogram during birth hospitalization. Thirty-seven had elevated ETCO values (ETCO greater than 2 ppm) and 11 of these 37 were found to be Coombs positive and the remaining 26 had other etiologies. Thirty-six of the 37 with elevated ETCO had repeat total bilirubin monitoring within 24 hours of discharge from the hospital. Of the 100 neonates, none was re-hospitalized for jaundice treatment. In comparison, 3,535 neonates who did not have an ETCO measurement during this period at these hospitals had a TB greater than the 75 th percentile on the Bhutani nomogram. Of these 3,535 neonates, 106 were re-hospitalized for jaundice between 3 and 11 days of life (rate = 2.99 per 100 neonates). This study showed that it is feasible to use CoSense to measure ETCO and, when an elevated ETCO is found during birth hospitalization, parents were likely to comply with advice to have the TB level rechecked within 24 hours of discharge. The results of this study were published in an article titled, &#8220;Measuring End-Tidal Carbon Monoxide of Jaundiced Neonates in the Birth Hospital to Identify Those with Hemolysis,&#8221; in Neonatalogy 2016. 

A multi-center investigator-sponsored trial to define the normative data (mean, median, range and interquartile ranges) for all term and late-preterm newborns for CoSense. The investigating institutions include Stanford University School of Medicine, Albert Einstein Medical Center, Beaumont Children&#8217;s Hospital, University of Pittsburg Medical Center and McKay-Dee Hospital/Intermountain Healthcare. Enrollment in this study was completed in February 2016. Three-hundred sixty-six newborns were enrolled into this study. The data for all subjects enrolled are currently under review and analysis. 

Another article titled, &#8220;Identification of neonatal hemolysis: an approach to pre-discharge management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia,&#8221; was electronically published ahead of print in Acta Paediatr. 2016 Jan 23. This article included results from 79 newborns with a GA greater than 35 weeks and birthweight greater than 2000 grams, who were enrolled at Lucile Packard Children&#8217;s Hospital. For each newborn, up to four ETCO measurements were taken once per day for up to four days of life in conjunctions with total bilirubin, or TB, levels. This study confirmed that pre-discharge measurements of TB together with ETCO can be used as an index of increased bilirubin loads due to hemolysis. 

Market Opportunity 

Independent market research that we conducted has identified a large market opportunity for the CoSense device in the well-baby nursery and labor and delivery units in term neonates (less than 37 weeks), as well as in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, in preterm births (less than 34 weeks) and late preterm births (between 34 and 37 weeks). 

In the U.S. and E.U., there are approximately 8.1 million term births and 1.1 million preterm and late preterm births each year. Approximately 60% of term births, or approximately 4.9 million babies, and 80% of preterm and late preterm babies, or approximately 900,000 babies, are jaundiced. These babies who have concurrent hemolysis are at greatest risk for adverse outcomes. We believe that neonates who are at risk for hemolysis and are candidates to receive one or more CoSense tests during their hospital stay. 

Today, the presence of jaundice triggers either a transcutaneous or serum bilirubin test. With the availability of CoSense, physicians may complement bilirubin testing with hemolysis testing in order to perform a more complete clinical assessment. Neonates who are jaundiced but not hemolyzing may receive conservative management or phototherapy. Neonates with jaundice found to be hemolyzing will likely receive early phototherapy and also additional testing such as the Coombs test, Hct 

or Retic to diagnose the underlying cause of hemolysis. We believe that CoSense will allow physicians to reduce the number of neonates that receive these more invasive and more costly tests for hemolysis. 

Sales and Marketing 

CoSense is indicated for the detection of the rate of hemolysis. The initial target market for CoSense is for evaluating neonates for the presence, or the rate, of hemolysis. In January of 2016, we entered into a distribution agreement with Bemes to market and distribute CoSense and our consumable PSS exclusively for sales, marketing, distribution and field service activities in the U.S. 

In the E.U., we expect to partner with distributors in each country/region, with oversight and marketing assistance from our personnel based in the United Kingdom. 

We expect the majority of our revenues to result from sales of consumables. Because we believe customers will order these repeatedly once they have adopted CoSense as part of their standard procedures, we expect that our sales force can drive higher revenue per salesperson than might otherwise be the case. 

Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Focus efforts on growing the volume of tests performed and associated consumables used. We plan to focus specifically on sales to the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, well-baby nursery, and labor/delivery units within each hospital. Because CoSense is a point-of-care device, each of these units of the hospital is a separate opportunity for CoSense placement. 

&#8226; 

Establish and engage a network of distributors in the E.U., as well as elsewhere in the world. We may establish continuing operations at a location in the E.U. to ensure close coordination and effective execution of the CoSense sales and marketing plan in the E.U. 

&#8226; 

Price the CoSense device at a level that allows hospitals to purchase it without protracted review via a &#8220;capital purchase committee&#8221; or analogous body. We believe that the cost of goods of CoSense devices allows us flexibility in setting this price, and we also believe we can offer customer hospitals attractive financing options to smooth out costs associated with the device purchase. 

&#8226; 

Price the CoSense consumable sampling set at a price that is competitive with the current costs of performing the Coombs Test and other associated invasive assays. We believe that this cost offset, complemented by potential improvements in readmission rates and clinical outcomes, will provide hospital decision-makers with a compelling economic case for adoption of CoSense. 

&#8226; 

Build awareness of the AAP treatment guidelines, and of the benefits of CoSense, via medical education efforts to key clinical audiences, including neonatologists, pediatricians, obstetricians, and pediatric nurses. 

&#8226; 

Collaborate with key specialty societies, including the AAP, Pediatric Academic Societies, American Academy of Family Physicians, or AAFP, and patient advocacy groups such as Parents of Infants and Children with Kernicterus, to ensure ongoing support for ETCO testing in clinical guidelines and to identify opportunities for expanding awareness of ETCO among their respective constituencies. 

&#8226; 

Support clinical trials and publications that expand the base of evidence supporting broad adoption of CoSense. We expect these efforts will build support for the clinical benefits to patients as well as economic benefits to various stakeholders in the healthcare system. 

We expect that we and our distributor will expand our sales efforts to encompass lower-volume birthing centers in the U.S. once a sufficient proportion of the larger hospitals have begun to use CoSense. We may also selectively initiate direct sales to certain countries in the E.U. Furthermore, we see potential to use CoSense to make more rapid assessments of jaundiced babies in the outpatient pediatric setting, where new parents are frequently directed for follow-up care after hospital discharge. We will continue to evaluate expansion opportunities and pursue those where the potential to accelerate our business is deemed sufficient for the investment we put at risk. 

Pricing and Reimbursement 

We expect to continue to sell the CoSense device at a price below the typical capital expenditure approval threshold levels of most hospitals and other medical institutions in the U.S. The decision to buy, therefore, will likely be driven at the departmental rather than at the institutional level. The primary decision makers are expected be the neonatologists and nurse managers in the pediatrics and neonatology departments. Our initial efforts are focused on expanding the installed base of devices and will be followed by efforts to increase use of the disposable sampling set. The business model anticipates a significant proportion of the revenues coming from the disposable sales, even more so in later years as the number of total CoSense devices in use in the field increases. With manufacturing scale up, we expect to achieve reduced cost of goods that will lead to scaleable future growth. 

Since the use of CoSense is almost entirely in the inpatient setting around the time of birth, reimbursement may be in the form of a Diagnosis-Related Group, or DRG. Frequently referred to as a bundled payment, the DRG is a specific flat-fee payment amount for all services performed by a medical institution pursuant to a single diagnosis. We can, therefore, be reimbursed for the cost of a test directly from an institution without the need to approach payors such as insurance companies, or to obtain a separate reimbursement cost code. Hospital decisions to adopt new technologies for inpatient care are usually driven by improved outcomes and reduced costs of patient care. We expect that the use of CoSense will both improve outcomes related to hyperbilirubinemia and reduce the need for certain diagnostic tests in a subset of neonates with jaundice, which, as a result, will reduce overall testing costs. We also believe that positive identification of infants with hemolysis will lead to a reduced rate of readmissions for jaundice, and this array of benefits may support adoption of CoSense by clinicians and their institutions. We also plan to undertake a comprehensive effort to partner with key physician specialty societies, physician opinion leaders and patient advocacy groups to educate and inform payer stakeholders. The AAP guidelines recommend ETCO detection to confirm the presence of hemolysis in neonates requiring phototherapy, neonates unresponsive to phototherapy or readmitted for phototherapy, and neonates with bilirubin levels approaching transfusion levels. In general, payor policies related to the care of neonates with jaundice reflect third-party treatment guidelines, and in this case the AAP guidelines favor use of ETCO testing, which CoSense is able to perform. 

Competition for CoSense 

Currently CoSense is the only device commercially available with the sensitivity and accuracy necessary to detect ETCO levels that are meaningful for monitoring the rate of hemolysis in neonates, and we do not know of any such device that is under development by any party. From 2001 to 2004, Natus Medical marketed the CO-Stat device for detection of ETCO in neonates. The Natus product was withdrawn from the market due to poor sales. We believe Natus&#8217; CO-Stat did not achieve commercial success due to several disadvantages that we have overcome with our product, including a lack of consistent accuracy, limited ability to compensate for environmental factors such as humidity and heat, high price, and poor ease of use, including a requirement for frequent calibration. 

In addition, devices are commercially available to measure CO poisoning from external sources, but these are less-sensitive devices that are not appropriate for detecting ETCO in the low concentrations (less than 10 ppm), small volumes and high breath rates that are clinically relevant in neonates. CoSense has the ability to overcome these problems using our Sensalyze technology. Several companies and academic groups have capabilities sufficient to develop such devices, and these parties may have significant resources to devote to research, development, and commercialization of devices that may compete with CoSense as well as technologies that compete with our Sensalyze Technology Platform generally. Competition within our target market will depend on several factors, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data; 

&#8226; 

confidence of health care providers in diagnostic results; 

&#8226; 

reimbursement and payment factors; 

&#8226; 

inclusion in practice guidelines; 

&#8226; 

cost-effectiveness; 

&#8226; 

ease of use; and 

&#8226; 

the strength of our intellectual property. 

Today, physicians primarily diagnose hemolysis via Coombs and other blood tests, and these will represent the primary competition to CoSense initially. These tests do not capture the rate of bilirubin production or the presence/absence of 

hemolysis, leaving the physician uncertain as to the patient&#8217;s level of risk. We believe that we can demonstrate compelling advantages over such tests, including faster results, the ability to avoid painful blood draws and greater diagnostic clarity and accuracy. We also believe we will be able to demonstrate economic and workflow advantages over the existing diagnostic practice. 

Our Sensalyze Technology Platform 

A variety of medical diagnostic testing is performed via measurement of gas concentrations, either from blood samples or from exhaled breath. Examples include capnometry and pulse oximetry, both routinely used in patient monitoring. Devices used for detecting the presence of various analytes in exhaled breath typically rely on the patient performing a specified breath maneuver. Examples of such maneuvers include breath holding, forced expiration, or breathing at a specified rate. The use of these devices is limited to those who can perform such maneuvers, such as adults and older children. 

The limitations of existing breath-based technologies are particularly problematic in neonates. Neonates typically have very rapid and irregular breathing patterns. They also inhale and exhale relatively small volumes, which limits the accuracy of devices that require the larger-volume sample sizes exhaled by older patients. In addition, they are not able to perform specified breath maneuvers. Our Sensalyze Technology Platform allows the measurement of analytes in all patients, from neonates to adults, regardless of their ability to actively perform a breath maneuver. 

Our Sensalyze Technology Platform combines hardware, sensors, and software to provide the following novel capabilities: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Identification of full breaths that follow a normal pattern, also known as &#8220;physiologic&#8221; breaths. Our platform can identify physiologic breaths even if the patient is breathing very rapidly, a capability that is particularly relevant in infants. 

&#8226; 

Capture of individual exhaled breaths, and segmentation of the breath into different components such as &#8220;end-tidal&#8221;, &#8220;upper airway&#8221;, and &#8220;lower airway&#8221;. This may allow the localization of the source of a given analyte to a specific anatomic area. 

&#8226; 

Ability to move a specific micro-liter component of breath to a sensor module. When combined, these capabilities provide a novel patent protected platform for non-invasive detection of various analytes. 

Sensalyze Technology Platform &#8212; Research and Development of Additional Diagnostic Products 

Our primary focus is currently on the commercialization of CoSense. Once the CoSense business is generating adequate revenue, we intend to utilize our research and development expertise to develop devices that leverage the capabilities of our Sensalyze Technology Platform. We expect to introduce additional products of our own over time and intend to develop additional diagnostic tests for analytes that might be found in the exhaled breath. These include the following diagnostic opportunities: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Nitric oxide or NO, for assessment and management of asthma in infants and young children; 

&#8226; 

End-tidal CO 2 &#32;for neonates; 

&#8226; 

Hydrogen breath testing for infants with malabsorption problems; 

&#8226; 

Carbon monoxide levels for hemolysis, CO poisoning or Sickle Cell Screening; 

&#8226; 

Acetone, nitrites for diabetes; 

&#8226; 

Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOC, for cancer, heart failure and multiple sclerosis; and 

&#8226; 

Alkanes, transplant rejection. We may also license elements of our Sensalyze Technology Platform to other companies that have complementary development or commercial capabilities. 

NeoForce Pulmonary Solutions 

Approximately 10% of newborns require some assistance to begin breathing at birth and represents the number of patients that would benefit from our products. Of this 10%, approximately 1% requires extensive resuscitative measures. Although the vast majority of newly born infants do not require intervention to make the transition from intrauterine to extra uterine life, because of the large number of births, a sizable number will require some degree of resuscitation. 

Respiratory adaptation 

In utero, most of the blood flow is shunted away from the lungs and directed to the placenta where fetoplacental gas exchange occurs. After birth, the airways and the alveoli must be cleared of fetal lung fluid so that the lungs can operate as a functional respiratory unit providing adequate gas exchange. Pulmonary blood flow must increase, and spontaneous respirations must be established. 

NeoForce T-Piece Resuscitation Platform 

A T-piece resuscitator is a manually operated resuscitation delivery device used for infants and small children (less than 10 kg) to effectively deliver inhalation breaths at preset peak inspiratory pressures, or PIP, and a small back pressure to keep the lungs from collapsing on exhalation, known as positive end expiratory pressures, or PEEP, at a preset Fi02, or percent oxygen. There are two components to T-piece Resuscitation, the &#8220;Box or T-piece Resuscitator&#8221; and a single patient use circuit. The circuit connects to the box on one end and the patient on the other through a mask. The box controls the PIP, and the circuit controls the PEEP through an adjustable valve. In general, it is a modern replacement for the traditional bag and mask which requires significant user training and experience to deliver breaths to infants with tiny and very delicate lungs and may result in injury due to inappropriately high pressure and/or larger volumes. 

Resuscitation and the First Breaths of Life 

Neonatal resuscitation skills are essential for all health care providers who are involved in the delivery of newborns. The transition from fetus to newborn requires intervention by a skilled individual or team in approximately 10% of all deliveries. In the U.S., 81% of all babies are born in nonteaching level I or II hospitals. In these hospitals, the volume of delivery service may not provide sufficient economic justification for the continuous in-hospital presence of specialists with high-risk delivery room experience, as recommended by the AAP Neonatal Resuscitation Guidelines, or NRP, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG. Perinatal asphyxia and extreme prematurity are the 2 complications of pregnancy that most frequently necessitate complex resuscitation by skilled personnel. However, only 60% of asphyxiated newborns can be predicted ante partum. The remaining newborns are not identified until the time of birth. Additionally, approximately 80% of low-birth-weight infants (infants less than 2kg) require resuscitation and cardio pumonary stabilization at post delivery. 

Nearly one half of newborn deaths (many of which involve extremely premature infants) occur during the first 24 hours after birth. Many of these early deaths also have a component of asphyxia or respiratory depression as an etiology. For the surviving infants, effective management of asphyxia in the first few minutes of life can influence long-term outcome. 

Even though prenatal care can identify many potential fetal difficulties ante partum, allowing maternal transfer to a referral center for care, many women who experience preterm labor are not identified prospectively and therefore are not appropriately transferred to a tertiary perinatal center. Consequently, many deliveries of extremely premature infants occur in smaller hospitals. 

For these reasons, all personnel involved in delivery room care of the newborn should be trained adequately in all aspects of neonatal resuscitation. Additionally, equipment that is appropriately sized to resuscitate infants of all gestational ages should be available in all delivering institutions, even if the institution does not care for preterm or intensive care infants. 

Market Opportunity 

The United Nations estimates the annual number of births worldwide to be approximately 143 million. Of these births, the number requiring assisted ventilation is approximately 10% of all births which represents the theoretical maximum addressable market potential. The addressable market is however much lower since a large number of infants are born in regions that do not have access to advanced resuscitation facilities, people or equipment. In general the market can be segmented along the economic development status of the country region where the infant is born and our current solutions are aligned to more developed regions such as the U.S., E.U., and portions of the Middle East. 

In the U.S. and E.U., there are approximately 8.1 million term births and 1.1 million preterm and late preterm births each year. Approximately 10% of term births, or approximately 800,000 babies, and 80% of preterm and late preterm babies, or approximately 88,000 babies, will need assisted ventilation during the birthing process or later in the NICU as a supplement to long term ventilation management, 

In the U.S. approximately the majority of all birthing hospitals have or use some form of T-piece resuscitation and are potential consumers of our T-piece solutions which include a delivery device (NeoPiP T-piece Resuscitator) or our universal T-piece single patient use circuit (NeoPiP Circuit). 

Sales and Marketing 

We intend to leverage the existing channels that we have in place to sell the newly acquired products from NeoForce. NFI has a well-established and efficient telemarketing presence that will supplement and extend our current distribution channel. In the U.S., we will continue to sell via a direct sales force, with potential augmentation of our reach via distributors. In the E.U., we expect to partner with distributors in each country, with oversight and marketing assistance from our personnel. 

Our U.S. direct sales efforts will continue to focus on large hospital systems with high volumes of births as the call points and decision makers for both NeoForce and CoSense customers are nearly identical. NeoForce has an installed base of over 300 customers and the existing relationships are anticipated to have a positive impact on creating interest in CoSense. 

The majority of NFI revenues will continue to be sales of our consumable T-piece circuits. 

Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Focus efforts on growing the volume of consumables used as our universal circuit will work with all installed base devices of NFI and its competitors. 

&#8226; 

Establish and engage a network of distributors in the E.U. and other international markets as conditions warrant. 

We will continue to evaluate expansion opportunities and pursue those where the potential to accelerate our business is deemed sufficient for the investment we put at risk. 

Pricing and Reimbursement 

NFI sells its products into a relatively mature market with established pricing and acquisition methods in place where the hospital focuses on price, clinical utility and improved safety as measures to &#8220;switch&#8221;. The decision to buy, therefore, will continue be driven at the departmental level controlled by the nursing management team overseeing the newborn areas of the institution, in conjunction with respiratory therapy. 

NFI is under contract with MedAssets, a GPO that represents approximately 35% of all hospitals in the US and sets fixed pricing as a function of volume. We will continue to utilize this contract to help expand sales of our neonatology products and will assess other GPO organizations as conditions warrant. 

There are no reimbursement issues for the NFI line of products as the devices and consumables for resuscitation are considered mission critical and covered under the hospitals operating budget at the department level. 

Competition for NeoForce Recitation Solutions 

T-piece resuscitation has been around since the early 1900&#8217;s but only became mainstream in the past 30 years mostly due to the efforts of Fisher and Paykel and their NeoPuff &#174; &#32;line of resuscitation devices. Their efforts in conjunction with the widespread integration of T-piece devices built into the radiant warmers used in the delivery room has created a substantial installed base of units that can use our consumable circuit. 

Companies that currently produce a T-piece solution include; GE Health Care, Fisher and Paykel, Drager Medical, Mercury Medical and CarFusion. Many of our competitors are part of large companies where T-piece is treated as an accessory or an extension of a larger portfolio of unrelated adult and pediatric solutions. Our focus on this market combined with our small size allows us to be nimble and responsive to changing market dynamics. 

Nasal CO 2 &#32;Technology 

Trigeminal Neuralgia 

TN is a clinical condition characterized by debilitating pain in regions innervated by one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The pain is typically described as intense, sharp and stabbing, and is often described as one of the most 

painful conditions known to humans. It may develop without apparent cause or be a result of another diagnosed disorder. Peripheral TN is caused by a variety of diseases, including multiple sclerosis and herpes zoster. 

The International Headache Society describes TN as a disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral brief electric shock-like pains, abrupt in onset and termination, limited to the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve and triggered by innocuous stimuli. There may be persistent background facial pain of moderate intensity. Based on the J. Penman 1968 publication in the Handbook of Clinical Neurology, we currently estimate that approximately 100,000 people are afflicted with TN in the U.S. 

In December 2015, we received orphan drug designation for our nasal, non-inhaled CO 2 &#32;technology for the treatment of TN. We have filed an IND with the FDA and started enrolling patients in a pilot clinical trial in early 2016. 

Cluster Headache 

Cluster headaches affect approximately 0.2% of the population, and are characterized by recurring bouts of excruciating pain in one side of the head. In episodic cluster headaches, episodes of pain typically last from 15 minutes to three hours and can occur several times a day over several months before remitting. The same pattern often recurs multiple times over a patient&#8217;s lifetime. Approximately 10% to 15% of cluster patients have chronic cluster headaches, which are characterized by continuing pain with no remission. The pain of cluster headache may be significantly greater than other conditions, such as severe migraine. 

In February 2015, we entered into an agreement with Clinvest, a division of Banyan Group, Inc., to conduct an investigator-sponsored clinical trial evaluating our nasal, non-inhaled carbon dioxide on up to 25 patients with episodic cluster headaches. 

In July 2015, we commenced enrollment in a pilot, single-center, investigator-sponsored clinical trial evaluating our proprietary nasal, non-inhaled CO 2 &#32;technology for the treatment of cluster headaches. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is the greatest change from pre-treatment headache pain intensity to post treatment. We expect to report top-line data from this trial in 2016. 

Allergic Rhinitis 

Allergic rhinitis, or AR, which is commonly and colloquially referred to as &#8220;allergies,&#8221; is characterized by symptoms that are often episodic and include nasal congestion, itching, sneezing and runny nose. It is one of the most common ailments in the western world and is growing rapidly, making AR one of the largest potential pharmaceutical markets. There are approximately 39 million sufferers in the U.S. and 48 million in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, and an additional 36 million in Japan, according to research firm GlobalData. Prevalence of AR is growing rapidly in the developed world. The most common AR drug therapies include antihistamines and intranasal steroids. Leukotriene inhibitors and other drugs are also currently prescribed to AR patients. Several of these drugs have generated sales in excess of $1 billion per year as branded products. However, these products have significant limitations and AR sufferers remain dissatisfied with the available treatments. Thus, there is a need for a more effective treatment with a faster onset of action and improved safety profile. 

AR is a cause of significant morbidity in spite of available treatments. According to the Allergies In America Survey conducted in 2006, most AR sufferers reported themselves to be less than &#8220;very satisfied&#8221; with the products they were taking for allergy relief. Fifty-two percent reported they had suffered from impaired work performance or missed work due to their AR symptoms even though 69% had used medication at some point in the prior four weeks. Current treatments provide incomplete relief from symptoms and have significant side effects such as drowsiness. 

Serenz is based upon the observation that non-inhaled CO 2 &#32;delivered at a low-flow rate into the nasal cavity, alleviates the symptoms of AR. Serenz is a convenient, hand-held device that delivers low-flow CO 2 &#32;to the nasal mucosa. It contains a pressurized canister of gas, with approximately enough gas to dose as-needed for one to two weeks. The device is disposable and engineered for ease of use. Our proprietary technology ensures very precise control of aspects such as flow rate and volume, which we believe are both critical to achieve the desired clinical performance. 

In our clinical trials to date, Serenz has shown a large effect size, an onset of effect within 30 minutes and is well tolerated. We believe that such a therapeutic index positions Serenz well to be a potential first-line treatment for any AR sufferer. Serenz can be taken as a stand-alone treatment or as an adjunct to other medications, and can be used on an as-needed basis. 

One Serenz device contains enough gas for approximately 22 doses, which we believe will treat AR for an average of one to two weeks, depending on frequency of use. We have not determined pricing for Serenz, but expect to price it at a premium to existing therapies for AR due to the benefits we believe the product provides to patients over such therapies. 

Based on clinical trials to date, we believe Serenz exhibits the ideal characteristics of an AR therapeutic, including: 

&#8226; Rapid relief 

&#8226; Relief from all nasal symptoms 

&#8226; Mild side effect profile 

&#8226; No known long-lasting side effects 

&#8226; Locally acting 

&#8226; Non-sedating 

&#8226; Non-steroidal 

&#8226; Usable on an as-needed basis 

&#160; 

The &#8220;As-Needed Only&#8221; Treatment Paradigm 

The traditional therapeutics used for the symptomatic treatment of AR have left a significant unmet need in this population. These therapeutics, mostly antihistamines and nasal steroids, are typically used on a scheduled basis, for example daily or twice a day. Given that the symptoms of AR are typically episodic, such as when an AR sufferer is exposed to a pollen when they step outdoors in allergy season, we believe an as- needed treatment paradigm is more optimal. The reason for chronic treatment of this episodic disorder is that the available treatments for AR take too long to act. Even when used &#8220;as-needed&#8221;, these products are unlikely to have a meaningful effect on efficacy in a very short time frame. 

Antihistamines typically take one or more hours to have an effect. Their efficacy may decrease further over time for patients and as exposure to allergens continues, whether seasonal or perennial. In addition, antihistamines in general do not have any effect on congestion. 

Nasal steroids can take days before peak effect. While they are more efficacious than antihistamines, they must be taken regularly during the allergy season or indefinitely for perennial allergies. In addition, they have bothersome side effects and are associated with the perception issues that relate to steroid use in general. 

We believe that a treatment that can act rapidly such that it can be taken only when needed is ideal for the AR patient population. In addition, it should not have any lasting or significant side effects. Serenz has the characteristics of such a treatment. 

Clinical Trials of Serenz in Allergic Rhinitis 

We have conducted six randomized, controlled clinical trials involving 975 patients, testing the safety and efficacy of nasal CO 2 &#32;in treating the symptoms of AR. Four of these clinical trials were in patients with seasonal AR, or SAR, and two of these clinical trials was in patients with perennial AR, or PAR. In addition, GlaxoSmithKline conducted a trial in 147 patients to assess the consumer appeal of Serenz for patients with nasal congestion. The trials using the as-needed approach showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful effects in both SAR and PAR. The effect is seen on each of the individual nasal and non-nasal symptoms, with as little as a 10 second per nostril application of Serenz. Given the rapid onset and generally mild side effect profile, we believe Serenz is ideally suited for marketing to patients for use on an as-needed basis. 

Safety of Serenz 

There were no application-related or device-related serious adverse events in any of the clinical trials conducted. Adverse events were generally mild and application-related, and resolved immediately upon cessation of application. The most common adverse events were transient nasal sensation and tearing of the eyes, or lacrimation, that lasted for the duration of the application only. 

The nasal sensation commonly encountered during these clinical trials was described by patients differently, and ranges from tingling to burning to pain. We also observed that these sensations were generally not severe enough for patients to discontinue use of nasal CO 2 , and for more than 1,000 patients treated in all of the AR clinical trials, only six patients 

discontinued use of nasal CO 2 &#32;due to an adverse event. We believe that these clinical trials provide evidence that gentle cleansing of the nasal mucosa with Serenz is safe, acts locally and provides rapid relief of allergy symptoms. 

Serenz Regulatory Status 

A CE Mark was granted to us for marketing of Serenz in the E.U. in December 2011. Following out-licensing of Serenz to GSK in 2013, we withdrew our CE mark, since CE marks are site-specific and not transferable. In June 2014, the agreement terminated and the licensed rights to Serenz was returned to us. 

The approval route for Serenz in the U.S. may be through a device approval or a drug-device combination approval. In the case of a drug-device combination, a new drug application, or NDA, filing with the FDA will be required. If it is a device approval pathway, it may be either via the PMA process, a de novo &#32;510(k) pathway, or traditional 510(k). Additional randomized, controlled clinical trials may be necessary to obtain approval. 

We recently reactivated the CE Mark for Serenz. We plan to move forward with pilot sales of Serenz to pharmacies in the E.U. during the second quarter of 2016 to gather commercial feedback in preparation of a possible full launch of Serenz later in 2016. 

Other Serenz Clinical Trials 

Prior to the nasal CO 2 &#32;Phase 2 clinical trials in AR, we had conducted a safety and feasibility study involving 54 patients in migraine patients. We have also explored the use of nasal CO 2 &#32;for treatment of migraine headaches and temporomandibular disorders. A total of 928 patients were enrolled across six separate safety and efficacy trials in these non-AR indications. The product showed signs of efficacy, statistically significant in some, but not all, trials, and rapid onset of effect. For strategic reasons we have focused further development on AR. Importantly, in the non-AR trials, the product showed a mild and well-tolerated safety profile that is similar to that seen in trials of Serenz for AR. 

Manufacturing 

We currently manufacture CoSense instruments at our facility in Redwood City, California. We assemble components from a variety of original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, sources. Our manufacturing facility is registered with the FDA and certified to the ISO 13485 standard, the internationally harmonized regulatory requirement for quality management systems of medical device companies. We may, depending on sales volume and ongoing requirements in specific sales geographies, outsource manufacturing of components, or finished goods, to various OEMs in the future. 

We have manufactured the Serenz device in partnership with an OEM supplier based in Shenzhen, China and intend to manufacture future supply with this same OEM supplier. 

NFI has its operations in Ivyland, Pennsylvania and is FDA registered and ISO 13485 certified. Its products are CE certified and are available for sale in the EU, as well as many other international markets. NFI assembles and tests the NeoPip resuscitators at its facility in Ivyland. The NeoPiP circuit is manufactured in Taiwan at an FDA registered ISO 13485 facility, with inventory stocked at NFI for distribution. NFI holds 4 to 6 months of inventory at any given time to assure it can meet expanded and growing demands for its solutions and to minimize transportation costs. 

Intellectual Property 

Our Sensalyze Technology Platform Patent Portfolio 

Our patent portfolio surrounding our Sensalyze Technology Platform, including CoSense, consists of one issued U.S. patent, four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, and eight pending U.S. provisional patent applications. Three of the non-provisional filings have corresponding Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, filings and are still eligible for expansion into other geographies. It is our intent to file these, and future cases, in other major commercial geographies over time. Our issued U.S. patent (no. 8,021,308) expires in August 2027. The pending patent applications, if issued, would likely expire on dates ranging from 2023 through 2034.

On May 11, 2010, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with BioMedical Drug Development, Inc., or BDDI, pursuant to which BDDI agreed to sell certain technology to us and BDDI received and was entitled to receive, among other consideration, certain royalty payments related to the technology. On June 4, 2012, George Tidmarsh and BDDI entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Asset Purchase Agreement was assigned and transferred to Mr. Tidmarsh. On June 30, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement with Mr. Tidmarsh and BDDI, whereby, among other things patent was purchased by us and, the royalty payments under the Asset Purchase Agreement were terminated. Pursuant to the Agreement and First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement, we (i) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Mr. Tidmarsh whereby we issued 40,000 shares of Common Stock to Mr. Tidmarsh and (ii) paid $150,000 to Mr. Tidmarsh and agreed to pay an additional $100,000 on each of the six, twelve and eighteen month anniversary of the Agreement and First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement. On December 21, 2015, we paid the first installment of $100,000. 

Serenz Patent Portfolio 

Successful application of therapeutic gases to the nasal mucosa is generally dependent on specific dosing, concentration, and rate of gas outflow. The CO 2 &#32;gas used in the Serenz product is packaged in small sealed cylinders with relatively high internal pressure; regulating the flow of gas from this high pressure cylinder to the relatively low flow rates required for Serenz presents significant technical challenges. Our Serenz patent portfolio addresses these challenges. 

Our Serenz patent portfolio consists of over 30 issued patents and over 40 pending patent applications. In the U.S., twelve issued patents, one allowed non-provisional patent application, and 7 pending non-provisional patent applications cover the Serenz technology. The U.S. patents and patent applications have corresponding issued patents and pending patent applications in developed nations. The expiration dates for the issued patents vary, with the latest being in 2022. Patent term extension due to regulatory review may be requested in the U.S. based upon one or more of the issued U.S. patents under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Our pending applications, when issued, would likely expire between 2020 and 2033. 

&#8226; 

Our issued patents and pending patent applications include claims directed to: 

&#8226; 

gas dispensing devices, including various nosepiece configurations, pressure regulators, and cylinder configurations; 

&#8226;

NFI Patent Portfolio 

NeoForce has designed and patented a device (Ispira) leveraging its neonatal resuscitation product platform to provide effective rescue breaths to pediatric and adult patients in conjunction with integrated cardiac defibrillators. 

Ispira is intended to address a need for improving the efficacy of pulmonary resuscitation in adults and pediatric patients. In the neonatal environment there has been a desire to control manual emergency resuscitation with respect to peak inspiratory pressure, positive end expiratory pressure and breath rate. Ispira brings this capability to the adult and pediatric patient market. The alternative to such a device is the BVM or anesthesia bag. The BVM bag is a device that functions as a bellows or bladder to deliver air to a patient by manual compression of the bag. The volume and pressure of delivered gas using manual compression is a function of many variables that include the size and strength of the person&#8217;s hand, familiarity with the device 

and even the level of fatigue of the person providing resuscitation. Each breath delivered by the BVM will be different and in some cases the difference can be significant. 

A U.S. utility patent application for the Ispira was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on July 17, 2007 and was assigned serial number 11/779,037, or the US Application. Claims 1-25 were accepted and pending in the application. The US Application was published as US 2009/0020127 on January 22, 2009. The patent was subsequently issued in July of 2011 and assigned patent #7,980,244. An international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, was filed on July 17, 2008 and assigned application number PCT/US2008/070332, or the PCT Application. The PCT Application claims priority to the US Application. The PCT Application published as PCT publication WO2009/012386 on January 22, 2009. An International Search Report, or ISR, was issued on January 30, 2009, for the PCT Application. In the ISR, claims 1-25 were found to be novel and to have industrial applicability. 

Government Regulation Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 

In the U.S., diagnostic assays are regulated by the FDA as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. We received initial FDA 510(k) clearance for CoSense in the fourth quarter of 2012 for the monitoring of CO from endogenous and exogenous sources in exhaled breath, particularly in smoking cessation programs for the screening of CO poisoning and smoke inhalation. In the first quarter of 2014, CoSense received 510(k) clearance for the monitoring of CO from endogenous sources, including hemolysis, and exogenous sources, including CO poisoning and smoke inhalation, in exhaled breath. Serenz has not yet commenced any process for regulatory approval in the U.S. We also plan to seek FDA clearance or approval for other diagnostic products currently under development. There are two regulatory pathways to receive authorization to market diagnostics: a 510(k) premarket notification and a premarket approval application, or PMA. The FDA makes a risk-based determination as to the pathway for which a particular diagnostic is eligible. CoSense was cleared via the 501(k) premarket notification pathway as a Class II medical device. 

The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes on the basis of the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls, including labeling, registration and listing and adherence to FDA&#8217;s quality system regulation, which are device-specific good manufacturing practices. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards and postmarket surveillance. Class III devices are subject to most of these requirements, as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket submissions to the FDA; most Class II devices require the submission of a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA; and Class III devices require submission of a PMA. Most diagnostic kits are regulated as Class I or II devices and are either exempt from premarket notification or require a 510(k) submission. 

510(k) premarket notification. &#32;A 510(k) notification requires the sponsor to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to another marketed device, termed a &#8220;predicate device,&#8221; that is legally marketed in the U.S. and for which a PMA was not required. A device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if it has the same intended use and technological characteristics as the predicate; or has the same intended use but different technological characteristics, where the information submitted to the FDA does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and demonstrates that the device is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed device. Under current FDA policy, if a predicate device does not exist, the FDA may make a risk-based determination based on the complexity and clinical utility of the device that the device is eligible for de novo &#32;510(k) review instead of a requiring a PMA. The de novo &#32;510(k) review process is similar to clearance of the 510(k) premarket notification, despite the lack of a suitable predicate device. 

The FDA&#8217;s performance goal review time for a 510(k) notification is 90 days from the date of receipt, however, in practice, the review often takes longer. In addition, the FDA may require information regarding clinical data in order to make a decision regarding the claims of substantial equivalence. Clinical studies of diagnostic products are typically designed with the primary objective of obtaining analytical or clinical performance data. If the FDA believes that the device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will issue a &#8220;Not Substantially Equivalent&#8221; letter and designate the device as a Class III device, which will require the submission and approval of a PMA before the new device may be marketed. Under certain circumstances, the sponsor may petition the FDA to make a risk-based determination of the new device and reclassify the new device as a Class I or Class II device. Any modifications made to a device, its labeling or its intended use after clearance may require a new 510(k) notification to be submitted and cleared by FDA. Some modifications may only require documentation to be kept by the manufacturer, but the manufacturer&#8217;s determination of the absence of need for a new 510(k) notification remains subject to subsequent FDA disagreement. 

The FDA has undertaken a systematic review of the 510(k) clearance process that includes both internal and independent recommendations for reform of the 510(k) system. The internal review, issued in August 2010, included a recommendation for development of a guidance document defining a subset of moderate risk (Class II) devices to include implantable, life- 

supporting or life-sustaining devices, called Class IIb, for which additional clinical or manufacturing data typically would be necessary to support a substantial equivalence determination. In the event that such new Class IIb sub-classification is adopted, we believe that most of the tests that we may pursue would be classified as Class IIa devices having the same requirements of the current Class II designation. In July 2011, the Institute of Medicine, or IOM, issued its independent recommendations for 510(k) reform. As the FDA receives public comment on the IOM recommendations and reconciles its plan of action to respond to both the internal and IOM recommendations, the availability of the 510(k) pathway for our diagnostic tests, and the timing and data burden required to obtain 510(k) clearance, could be adversely impacted. We cannot predict the impact of the 510(k) reform efforts on the development and clearance of our future diagnostic tests. 

De Novo 510(k) . If a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because there is no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent, and if the device may be adequately regulated through general controls or special controls, the device may be eligible for de novo &#32;classification through what is called the de novo &#32;review process. In order to use the de novo &#32;review process, a company must receive a letter from the FDA stating that, because the device has been found not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II medical device or to a Class III device marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not required the submission of a PMA application, it has been placed into Class III. After receiving this letter, we, within 30 days, must submit to the FDA a request for a risk based down classification of the device from Class III to Class I or II based on the device&#8217;s moderate or low risk profile which meets the definition of a Class I or Class II medical device. The FDA then has 60 days in which to decide whether to down classify the device. If the FDA agrees that a lower classification is warranted, it will issue a new regulation describing the device type and, for a Class II device, publish a Special Controls guidance document. The Special Controls guidance document specifies the scope of the device type and the recommendations for submission of subsequent devices for the same intended use. If a product is classified as Class II through the de novo &#32;review process, then that device may serve as a predicate device for subsequent 510(k) pre-market notifications. 

Premarket approval. &#32;The PMA process is more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by more detailed and comprehensive scientific evidence, including clinical data, to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the medical device for its intended purpose. If the device is determined to present a &#8220;significant risk,&#8221; the sponsor may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to the FDA and obtains approval from the FDA to begin the trial. 

After the PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to make a threshold determination that the PMA is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the PMA is complete, the FDA will file the PMA. The FDA is subject to a performance goal review time for a PMA of 180 days from the date of filing, although in practice this review time is longer. Questions from the FDA, requests for additional data and referrals to advisory committees may delay the process considerably. Indeed, the total process may take several years and there is no guarantee that the PMA will ever be approved. Even if approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the device may be marketed. The FDA may also request additional clinical data as a condition of approval or after the PMA is approved. Any changes to the medical device may require a supplemental PMA to be submitted and approved. 

Regulation of Pharmaceuticals or Combination Products. &#32;In the U.S., the FDA may determine that Serenz should be regulated as a combination product or as a drug. The sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FFDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, a clinical hold, warning letters, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. 

FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current good laboratory practice regulation; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.; 

&#8226; 

approval by an IRB at each clinical trial site before a trial may be initiated at the site; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations, and for devices and device components, the FDA&#8217;s Quality Systems Regulation, or QSR, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and 

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

The pre-clinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our future products will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places a trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

Further, an independent IRB, covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the NIH-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

Phase 1: &#32;The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

Phase 2: &#32;The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 

Phase 3: &#32;These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product appears to be effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. 

Phase 4: &#32;In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a future product on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. 

The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product&#8217;s pharmacology, CMC and proposed labeling, among other things. 

For combination products, the FDA&#8217;s review may include the participation of both the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA&#8217;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, which may complicate or prolong the review. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP, and if applicable, QSR, requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP before approving an NDA. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and, in some cases, the related manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter, or it may issue a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. CRLs generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when the deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, and, even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product or impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions or other risk-management mechanisms. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the sponsor may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require the development of additional data or conduct of additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 

Continuing FDA Regulation 

Devices. &#32;Under the medical device regulations, the FDA regulates quality control and manufacturing procedures by requiring us to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the quality system regulation, which sets forth the FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practices requirements for medical devices. The FDA monitors compliance with the quality system regulation and current good manufacturing practices requirements by conducting periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities. We could be subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA. Violations of applicable regulations noted by the FDA during inspections of our manufacturing facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of these third parties, could adversely affect the continued marketing of our tests. 

The FDA also enforces post-marketing controls that include the requirement to submit medical device reports to the agency when a manufacturer becomes aware of information suggesting that any of its marketed products may have caused or contributed to a death, serious injury or serious illness or any of its products has malfunctioned and that a recurrence of a malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or illness. The FDA relies on medical device reports to identify product problems and utilizes these reports to determine, among other things, whether it should exercise its enforcement powers. The FDA may also require postmarket surveillance studies for specified devices. 

FDA regulations also govern, among other things, the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, distribution, labeling and promotion of medical devices. In addition to compliance with good manufacturing practices and medical device reporting requirements, we will be required to comply with the FDCA&#8217;s general controls, including establishment registration, device listing and labeling requirements. If we fail to comply with any requirements under the FDCA, we could be subject to, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or product corrections, total or partial suspension of production, denial of premarket notification clearance or approval of products, rescission or withdrawal of clearances and approvals, and criminal prosecution. We cannot assure you that any final FDA policy, once issued, or future laws and regulations concerning the manufacture or marketing of medical devices will not increase the cost and time to market of new or existing tests. Furthermore, any current or future federal and state regulations also will apply to future tests developed by us. 

If our promotional activities fail to comply with these FDA regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, suspend or withdraw a product from the market, require a recall or institute fines or civil fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution. 

Pharmaceuticals. &#32;Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug-device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP or QSR requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP or QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP or QSR compliance. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market, though the FDA must provide an application holder with notice and an opportunity for a hearing in order to withdraw its approval of an application. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#8226; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#8226; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 

&#8226; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and 

&#8226; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug and device products that are placed on the market. While physicians may prescribe drugs and devices for off label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

Advertising 

Advertising of our neonatology products are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the FTC Act. The FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Violations of the FTC Act, such as failure to have substantiation for product claims, would subject us to a variety of enforcement actions, including compulsory process, cease and desist orders and injunctions, which can require, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress and restitution, as well as substantial fines or other penalties. Any enforcement actions by the FTC could have a material adverse effect our business. 

HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established for the first time comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or &#8220;Covered Entities&#8221;: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their Business Associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. Because we are a healthcare provider and we conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically, we are presently a Covered Entity, and we must have in place the administrative, physical, and technical safeguards required by HIPAA, HITECH and their implementing regulations. Additionally, some state laws impose privacy protections more stringent than HIPAA. Most of the institutions and physicians from which we obtain biological specimens that we use in our research and validation work are Covered Entities and must obtain proper authorization from their patients for the subsequent use of those samples and associated clinical information. We may perform future activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as providing clinical laboratory testing services or entering into specific kinds of relationships with a Covered Entity or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity. 

If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 

Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws. For example, there are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain tissue samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans. 

Federal and State Billing and Fraud and Abuse Laws 

Antifraud Laws/Overpayments . As participants in federal and state healthcare programs, we are subject to numerous federal and state antifraud and abuse laws. Many of these antifraud laws are broad in scope, and neither the courts nor government agencies have extensively interpreted these laws. Prohibitions under some of these laws include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the submission of false claims or false information to government programs; 

&#8226; 

deceptive or fraudulent conduct; 

&#8226; 

excessive or unnecessary services or services at excessive prices; and 

&#8226; 

prohibitions in defrauding private sector health insurers. 

We could be subject to substantial penalties for violations of these laws, including denial of payment and refunds, suspension of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs and exclusion from participation in the federal healthcare programs, as well as civil monetary and criminal penalties and imprisonment. One of these statutes, the False Claims Act, is a key enforcement tool used by the government to combat healthcare fraud. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. In addition, violations of the federal physician self-referral laws, such as the Stark laws discussed below, may also violate false claims laws. Liability under the False Claims Act can result in treble damages and imposition of penalties. For example, we could be subject to penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim, and each use of our product could potentially be part of a different claim submitted to the government. Separately, the HHS office of the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, can exclude providers found liable under the False Claims Act from participating in federally funded healthcare programs, including Medicare. The steep penalties that may be imposed on laboratories and other providers under this statute may be disproportionate to the relatively small dollar amounts of the claims made by these providers for reimbursement. In addition, even the threat of being excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs can have significant financial consequences on a provider. 

Numerous federal and state agencies enforce the antifraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may also bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery. 

Federal and State &#8220;Self-Referral&#8221; and &#8220;Anti-Kickback&#8221; Restrictions 

Self-Referral law . We are subject to a federal &#8220;self-referral&#8221; law, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Stark&#8221; law, which provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. 

We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payors regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law. For example, we are subject to a North Carolina self-referral law that prohibits a physician investor from referring to us any patients covered by private, employer-funded or state and federal employee health plans. The North Carolina self-referral law contains few exceptions for physician investors in securities that have not been 

acquired through public trading, but will generally permit us to accept referrals from physician investors who buy their shares in the public market. 

We have several stockholders who are physicians in a position to make referrals to us. We have included within our compliance plan procedures to identify requests for testing services from physician investors and we do not bill Medicare, or any other federal program, or seek reimbursement from other third-party payors, for these tests. The self-referral laws may cause some physicians who would otherwise use our laboratory to use other laboratories for their testing. 

Providers are subject to sanctions for claims submitted for each service that is furnished based on a referral prohibited under the federal self-referral laws. These sanctions include denial of payment and refunds, civil monetary payments and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and civil monetary penalties, and they may also include penalties for applicable violations of the False Claims Act, which may require payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim. Similarly, sanctions for violations under the North Carolina self-referral laws include refunds and monetary penalties. 

Anti-Kickback Statute . The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or PPACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Sanctions for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may include imprisonment and other criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 

The OIG has criticized a number of the business practices in the clinical laboratory industry as potentially implicating the Anti-Kickback Statute, including compensation arrangements intended to induce referrals between laboratories and entities from which they receive, or to which they make, referrals. In addition, the OIG has indicated that &#8220;dual charge&#8221; billing practices that are intended to induce the referral of patients reimbursed by federal healthcare programs may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. 

Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. For example, North Carolina has an anti-kickback statute that prohibits healthcare providers from paying any financial compensation for recommending or securing patient referrals. Penalties for violations of this statute include license suspension or revocation or other disciplinary action. Other states have similar anti-kickback prohibitions. 

Both the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the North Carolina anti-kickback law are broad in scope. The anti-kickback laws clearly prohibit payments for patient referrals. Under a broad interpretation, these laws could also prohibit a broad array of practices involving remuneration where one party is a potential source of referrals for the other. 

If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any product we make is sold in a foreign country in the future, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. To reduce the risks associated with these various laws and governmental regulations, we have implemented a compliance plan. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly. 

International Medical Device Regulations 

International marketing of medical devices is subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for directives with which manufacturers selling medical products in the E.U. and the European Economic Area, or EEA, must comply. The E.U. includes most of the major countries in Europe, while other countries, such as Switzerland, are part of the EEA and have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the E.U. with respect to medical devices. The E.U. has adopted directives that address regulation of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies and post-market vigilance for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the E.U. and EEA. 

Outside of the E.U., regulatory pathways for the marketing of medical devices vary greatly from country to country. In many countries, local regulatory agencies conduct an independent review of medical devices prior to granting marketing approval. For example, in China, approval by the SFDA, must be obtained prior to marketing an medical device. In Japan, approval by the MHLW following review by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or the PMDA is required prior to marketing an medical device. The process in such countries may be lengthy and require the expenditure of significant resources, including the conduct of clinical trials. In other countries, the regulatory pathway may be shorter or less costly. The timeline for the introduction of new medical devices is heavily impacted by these various regulations on a country-by-country basis, which may become more lengthy and costly over time. 

U.S. Healthcare Reform 

In March 2010, the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Beginning in August 2013, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, enacted as part of PPACA, and its implementing regulations requires medical device manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any &#8220;transfer of value&#8221; made or distributed to such entities, as well as any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report this information to Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, beginning in 2014. Various states have also implemented regulations prohibiting certain financial interactions with healthcare professionals or mandating public disclosure of such financial interactions. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 

Recent Developments 

March 2015 Private Transaction 

On March 5, 2015, we entered into, and subsequently consummated, a private transaction, or the Private Transaction, pursuant to a Warrant Exercise Agreement, or the Warrant Exercise Agreement, with certain holders of our Series B Warrants. The Series B Warrants were originally issued in connection with our IPO, and were exercisable for up to an aggregate of 2,449,605 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.50 per share prior to their expiration on February 12, 2016. Pursuant to the Warrant Exercise Agreement, certain participating holders of Series B Warrants and we agreed that such Series B Warrant holders would cash exercise their Series B Warrants in full and we would issue to the holders Series C Warrants, at an exercise price of $6.25 per share to purchase up to an aggregate of 589,510 shares of Common Stock, which represented the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Series B Warrants to be cash exercised pursuant to the Warrant Exercise Agreement. We received gross proceeds of approximately $3.8 million from the cash exercises of the Series B Warrants in connection with the Private Transaction. 

In consideration for the cash exercise of the Series B Warrants in connection with the Private Transaction and pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Exercise Agreement, we issued the Series C Warrants to the exercising holders of Series B Warrants, of which each Series C Warrant: (i) is exercisable at $6.25 per share; (ii) is exercisable for the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the Series B Warrants that were cash exercised by such holders; (iii) is immediately exercisable upon issuance and until March 4, 2020; and (iv) does not include the cashless exercise feature that was contained in the Series B Warrant that 

results in an increasing number of shares of Common Stock issuable without consideration as the price of the Common Stock decreases is not contained in the Series C Warrants. 

In connection with the Private Transaction, we relied on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, for transactions not involving a public offering, and Rule 506 of Regulation D thereunder as a private offering, without general solicitation, made only to and with accredited investors. We filed a Notice of Exempt Offering on Form D on March 11, 2015 covering the Private Transaction and the Series C Warrants. 

Pursuant to the Warrant Exercise Agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering the underlying shares of Common Stock exercisable under the Series C Warrants issued in the Private Transaction, which was declared effective under the Securities Act, on May 19, 2015. The Warrant Exercise Agreement provides for payment of liquidated damages at an amount per month equal to 1% of the aggregate VWAP of the shares into which each warrant is convertible into in the event that we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement. 

On June 25, 2015, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC, we offered all remaining holders of Series B Warrants the opportunity to exercise the Series B Warrants held by them and receive Series C Warrants with the same terms indicated above. The exchange offer, or the Exchange Offer, expired on July 24, 2015. The holders of Series B Warrants to purchase 905 shares of Common Stock, representing 0.06% of the then outstanding Series B Warrants, tendered such Series B Warrants in the Exchange Offer and, pursuant thereto, were issued 905 shares of Common Stock and Series C Warrants to purchase 905 shares of Common Stock. The aforementioned prospectus covers the 905 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Series C Warrants issued in the Exchange Offer. 

Aspire Private Transaction 

On July 24, 2015, we entered into the Aspire Purchase Agreement which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of $10.0 million of shares of our Common Stock over the 24-month term of the Aspire Purchase Agreement. Concurrently with entering into the Aspire Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement, or the Aspire Registration Rights Agreement, with Aspire Capital, in which we agreed to file one or more registration statements, as permissible and necessary to register under the Securities Act, registering the sale of the shares of our Common Stock that have been and may be issued to Aspire Capital under the Aspire Purchase Agreement. The SEC declared our registration statement in connection with the foregoing effective on August 10, 2015. 

Under the Aspire Purchase Agreement, on any trading day selected by us, we have the right, in our sole discretion, to present Aspire Capital with a purchase notice directing it to purchase up to 75,000 shares of our Common Stock per business day, up to $10.0 million of our Common Stock in the aggregate at a per share price equal to the lesser of: (x) the lowest sale price of the our Common Stock on the purchase date; or (y) the arithmetic average of the three (3) lowest closing sale prices for our Common Stock during the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the purchase date. 

In addition, on any date on which we submit a purchase notice, as referred to above, to Aspire Capital in an amount equal to at least 75,000 shares, we also have the right, in our sole discretion, to present Aspire Capital with a volume-weighted average price purchase notice, or a VWAP Purchase Notice, directing Aspire Capital to purchase an amount of stock equal to up to 30% of the aggregate shares of our Common Stock traded on the principal market for our Common Stock on the next trading day, or the VWAP Purchase Date, subject to a maximum number of shares that we may determine. The purchase price per share pursuant to such VWAP Purchase Notice is generally 97% of the volume-weighted average price for our Common Stock traded on the principal market on the VWAP Purchase Date. 

The purchase price referred to above will be adjusted for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, or other similar transaction occurring during the period(s) used to compute it. We may deliver multiple purchase notices and VWAP Purchase Notices to Aspire Capital from time to time during the term of the Aspire Purchase Agreement, so long as the most recent purchase has been completed. 

The Aspire Purchase Agreement provides that we and Aspire Capital shall not effect any sales under the Aspire Purchase Agreement on any purchase date where the closing sale price of our Common Stock is less than $2.63. There are no trading volume requirements or restrictions under the Aspire Purchase Agreement, and we will control the timing and amount of sales of our Common Stock to Aspire Capital. Aspire Capital has no right to require any sales by us, but is obligated to make purchases from us as directed by us in accordance with the Aspire Purchase Agreement. There are no limitations on use of proceeds, financial or business covenants, restrictions on future fundings, rights of first refusal, participation rights, penalties or liquidated damages in the Aspire Purchase Agreement. In consideration for entering into the Aspire Purchase Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued to Aspire Capital 71,891 shares of our Common Stock. The Aspire Purchase Agreement may be terminated by us at any time, at our discretion, without any cost to us. Aspire Capital has agreed that neither it nor any of its agents, representatives and affiliates shall engage in any direct or indirect short-selling 

or hedging of our Common Stock during any time prior to the termination of the Aspire Purchase Agreement. Any proceeds we receive under the Aspire Purchase Agreement are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

On October 12, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with funds managed by Sabby Management, LLC, or Sabby, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell to Sabby, in a private placement, an aggregate of up to 10,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at an aggregate purchase price of $10,000,000, which is convertible into 5,405,405 shares of our Common Stock, based on a fixed conversion price of $1.85 per share on an as-converted basis, and Series D Common Stock Warrants to purchase 2,702,704 shares of our Common Stock, based on a fixed per share exercise price of $2.46. The first close consummated on October 15, 2015. 

As a result of the Sabby transaction, until April 3, 2016, we are currently unable to access funds from Aspire Capital pursuant to the Aspire Purchase Agreement.
