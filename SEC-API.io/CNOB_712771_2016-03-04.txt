These forward-looking statements concern the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including statements preceded by, followed by or that include words or phrases such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;trend,&#8221; &#8220;objective,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;remain,&#8221; &#8220;pattern&#8221; or similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; &#8220;may&#8221; or similar expressions. There are a number of important factors that could cause future results to differ materially from historical performance and these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (1) competitive pressures among depository institutions may increase significantly; (2) changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins; (3) prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions may vary substantially from period to period; (4) general economic conditions may be less favorable than expected; (5) political developments, wars or other hostilities may disrupt or increase volatility in securities markets or other economic conditions; (6) legislative or regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the businesses in which ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. is engaged; (7) changes and trends in the securities markets may adversely impact ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc.; (8) a delayed or incomplete resolution of regulatory issues could adversely impact our planning; (9) difficulties in integrating any businesses that we may acquire, which may increase our expenses and delay the achievement of any benefits that we may expect from such acquisitions; (10) the impact of reputation risk created by the developments discussed above on such matters as business generation and retention, funding and liquidity could be significant; and (11) the outcome of any future regulatory and legal investigations and proceedings may not be anticipated. Further information on other factors that could affect the financial results of ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. are included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in ConnectOne Bancorp&#8217;s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available free of charge at the Commission&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov and/or from ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements at any time. 

ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc., (the &#8220;Company&#8221; and with ConnectOne Bank, &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) a one-bank holding company, was incorporated in the state of New Jersey on November 12, 1982 as Center Bancorp, Inc. and commenced operations on May 1, 1983 upon the acquisition of all outstanding shares of capital stock of Union Center National Bank, its then principal subsidiary. 

On January 20, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (&#8220;Legacy ConnectOne&#8221;). Effective July 1, 2014, the Company completed the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) with Legacy ConnectOne merging with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation. Also at closing, the Company changed its name to &#8220;ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc.&#8221; and changed its NASDAQ trading symbol to &#8220;CNOB&#8221;. Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, Union Center Bank merged with and into ConnectOne Bank, a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank (&#8220;ConnectOne Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Legacy ConnectOne, with ConnectOne Bank continuing as the surviving bank. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of common stock, no par value per share, of Legacy ConnectOne was converted into 2.6 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. 

The Company&#8217;s primary activity, at this time, is to act as a holding company for the Bank and its other subsidiaries. As used herein, the term &#8220;Parent Corporation&#8221; shall refer to the Company on an unconsolidated basis. 

The Company owns 100% of the voting shares of Center Bancorp, Inc. Statutory Trust II, through which it issued trust preferred securities. The trust exists for the exclusive purpose of (i) issuing trust securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trust; (ii) investing the gross proceeds of the trust securities in $5.2 million of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (subordinated debentures) of the Company; and (iii) engaging in only those activities necessary or incidental thereto. These subordinated debentures and the related income effects are not eliminated in the consolidated financial statements as the statutory business trust is not consolidated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) FASB ASC 810-10 &#8220;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.&#8221; Distributions on the subordinated debentures owned by the subsidiary trust have been classified as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Except as described above, the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries are all included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. These subsidiaries include an advertising subsidiary; an insurance subsidiary offering annuity products, property and casualty, life and health insurance, and various investment subsidiaries which hold, maintain and manage investment assets for the Company. The Company&#8217;s subsidiaries also include a real estate investment trust (the &#8220;REIT&#8221;) which holds a portion of the Company&#8217;s real estate loan portfolio. All subsidiaries mentioned above are directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company, except that the Company owns less than 100% of the preferred stock of the REIT. A real estate investment trust must have 100 or more shareholders. The REIT has issued less than 20% of its outstanding non-voting preferred stock to individuals, primarily Bank personnel and directors.

Narrative Description of the Business 

We offer a broad range of deposit and loan products and services to the general public and, in particular, to small and mid-sized businesses, local professionals and individuals residing, working and conducting business in our trade area. 

While we expect to take an opportunistic approach to acquisitions, considering opportunities to purchase whole institutions, branches or lines of business that complement our existing strategy in the future, we expect the bulk of our future growth to be organic. Our goal is to open new offices in the counties contained in our broader trade area discussed below. However, we do not believe that we need to establish a physical location in each market that we serve. We believe that advances in technology have created new delivery channels which allow us to service customers and maintain business relationships without a physical presence, and that these customers can also be serviced through a regional office. We believe the key to customer acquisition and retention is establishing quality teams of lenders and business relationship officers who will frequently go to the customer, rather than having the customer come into the branch. 

We emphasize superior customer service and relationship banking. The Bank offers high-quality service by minimizing personnel turnover and by providing more direct, personal attention than we believe is offered by competing financial institutions, the majority of which are branch offices of banks headquartered outside our primary trade area. By emphasizing the need for a professional, responsive and knowledgeable staff, we offer a superior level of service to our customers. As a result of senior management&#8217;s availability for consultation on a daily basis, we believe we offer customers a quicker response on loan applications and other banking transactions than competitors, whose decisions may be made in distant headquarters. We believe that this response time results in a pricing advantage to us, in that we frequently may exceed competitors&#8217; loan pricing and still win customers. We also provide state-of-the-art banking technology, including remote deposit capture, internet banking and mobile banking, to provide our customers with the most choices and maximum flexibility. We believe that this combination of quick, responsive and personal service and advanced technology provides the Bank&#8217;s customers with a superior banking experience. 

The Bank, through its subsidiary, Center Financial Group LLC, provides financial services, including brokerage services, insurance and annuities, mutual funds and financial planning. 

Our Market Area 

Our banking offices are located in Bergen, Union, Morris, Essex, Hudson, Mercer and Monmouth Counties in New Jersey and in the borough of Manhattan, in New York City, which include some of the most affluent markets in the United States. We also attract business and customers from broader regions , including northern New Jersey, the five boroughs of New York City, and Westchester and Nassau counties in New York State. 

Products and Services 

We derive a majority of our revenue from net interest income (i.e., the difference between the interest we receive on our loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings). We offer a broad range of deposit and loan products. In addition, to attract the business of consumer and business customers, we also provide a broad array of other banking services. Products and services provided include personal and business checking accounts, retirement accounts, money market accounts, time and savings accounts, credit cards, wire transfers, access to automated teller services, internet banking, Treasury Direct, ACH origination, lockbox services and mobile banking by phone. In addition, we offer safe deposit boxes. The Bank also offers remote deposit capture banking for both retail and business customers, providing the ability to electronically scan and transmit checks for deposit, reducing time and cost. 

Checking account products consist of both retail and business demand deposit products. Retail products include Totally Free checking and, for businesses, both interest-bearing accounts, which require a minimum balance, and non-interest bearing accounts. NOW accounts consist of both retail and business interest-bearing transaction accounts that have minimum balance requirements. Money market accounts consist of products that provide a market rate of interest to depositors but offers a limited number of preauthorized withdrawals. Our savings accounts consist statement type accounts. Time deposits consist of certificates of deposit, including those held in IRA accounts, generally with initial maturities ranging from 7 days to 60 months and brokered certificates of deposit, which we use for asset liability management purposes and to supplement other sources of funding. CDARS/ICS Reciprocal deposits are offered based the Bank&#8217;s participation in Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC. Customers who are FDIC insurance sensitive are able to place large dollar deposits with the Company and the Company uses CDARS to place those funds into certificates of deposit issued by other banks in the Network. This occurs in increments of less than the FDIC insurance limits so that both the principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance coverage in amounts larger than the standard dollar amount. The FDIC currently considers these funds as brokered deposits.

Deposits serve as the primary source of funding for our interest-earning assets, but also generate non-interest revenue through insufficient funds fees, stop payment fees, wire transfer fees, safe deposit rental fees, debit card income, including foreign ATM fees and credit and debit card interchange, gift card fees, and other miscellaneous fees. In addition, the Bank generates additional non-interest revenue associated with residential loan origination and sale, loan servicing, late fees and merchant services. 

We offer personal and commercial business loans on a secured and unsecured basis, revolving lines of credit, commercial mortgage loans, and residential mortgages on both primary and secondary residences, home equity loans, bridge loans and other personal purpose loans. However, we are not and have not historically been a participant in the sub-prime lending market. 

Commercial loans are loans made for business purposes and are primarily secured by collateral such as cash balances with the Bank, marketable securities held by or under the control of the Bank, business assets including accounts receivable, taxi medallions, inventory and equipment, and liens on commercial and residential real estate. As of December 31, 2015, our taxi medallion portfolio totaled $103.2 million, of which $99.9 million was current and $3.3 million was past due 30-60 days. All of our taxi medallion loans are secured by New York City taxi medallions. Troubled debt restructurings associated with this portfolio totaled $78.5 million. The average loan-to-value ratio of the medallion portfolio was approximately 90% assuming valuations of $800 thousand for corporate and $700 thousand for individual. 

Commercial construction loans are loans to finance the construction of commercial or residential properties secured by first liens on such properties. Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by first liens on completed commercial properties, including multi-family properties, to purchase or refinance such properties. Residential mortgages include loans secured by first liens on residential real estate, and are generally made to existing customers of the Bank to purchase or refinance primary and secondary residences. Home equity loans and lines of credit include loans secured by first or second liens on residential real estate for primary or secondary residences. Consumer loans are made to individuals who qualify for auto loans, cash reserve, credit cards and installment loans. 

The Board of Directors has approved a loan policy granting designated lending authorities to specific officers of the Bank. Those officers are comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Team Leader and the Consumer Loan Officer. All loan approvals require the signatures of a minimum of two officers. The Senior Lending Group (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer) can approve loans up to $25 million in aggregate loan exposure and not exceed 65% of the Legal Lending Limit of the Bank (currently $60.5 million as of December 31, 2015 for most loans), provided that (i) the credit does not involve an exception to policy greater than $7.5 million or $20 million in all credit outstanding to the borrower in the aggregate, (ii) the credit does not exceed certain dollar amount thresholds set forth in our policy, which varies by loan type, and (iii) the credit is not extended to an insider of the Bank. The Board Loan Committee (which includes the Chief Executive Officer and four other Board members) approves credits that are both exceptions to policy and are above prescribed amounts related to loan type and collateral. Loans to insiders must be approved by the entire Board. 

The Bank&#8217;s lending policies generally provide for lending inside of our primary trade area. However, the Bank will make loans to persons outside of our primary trade area when we deem it prudent to do so. In an effort to promote a high degree of asset quality, the Bank focuses primarily upon offering secured loans. However, the Bank does make short-term unsecured loans to borrowers with high net worth and income profiles. The Bank generally requires loan customers to maintain deposit accounts with the Bank. In addition, the Bank generally provides for a minimum required rate of interest in its variable rate loans. We believe that having senior management on-site allows for an enhanced local presence and rapid decision-making that attracts borrowers. The Bank&#8217;s legal lending limit to any one borrower is 15% of the Bank&#8217;s capital base (defined as tangible equity plus the allowance for loan and lease losses) for most loans ($60.5 million) and 25% of the capital base for loans secured by readily marketable collateral ($100.8 million). At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s largest committed relationship (to several affiliated borrowers) totaled $57.9 million. The Bank&#8217;s largest single loan outstanding at December 31, 2015 was $27.7 million. 

Our business model includes using industry best practices for community banks, including personalized service, state-of-the-art technology and extended hours. We believe that this will generate deposit accounts with somewhat larger average balances than are found at many other financial institutions. We also use pricing techniques in our efforts to attract banking relationships having larger than average balances. 

Competition 

The banking business is highly competitive. We face substantial immediate competition and potential future competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations, many of which have assets, capital and lending limits larger than those that we have. Other competitors include money market mutual funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small loan companies, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities. 

- 6 - 

Our larger competitors have greater financial resources to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns. Additionally, we endeavor to compete for business by providing high quality, personal service to customers, customer access to our decision-makers and competitive interest rates and fees. We seek to hire and retain quality employees who desire greater responsibility than may be available working for a larger employer. 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

The banking industry is highly regulated. Statutory and regulatory controls increase a bank holding company&#8217;s cost of doing business and limit the options of its management to deploy assets and maximize income. The following discussion is not intended to be a complete list of all the activities regulated by the banking laws or of the impact of such laws and regulations on the Company or the Bank. It is intended only to briefly summarize some material provisions. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;Holding Company Act&#8221;). As a bank holding company, the Company is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by the FRB. 

The Holding Company Act prohibits the Company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking &#8220;as to be a proper incident thereto.&#8221; The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the acquisition by the Company of more than 5% of the voting stock of any other bank. Satisfactory capital ratios and Community Reinvestment Act ratings and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions. The policy of the FRB provides that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not do so absent that policy. 

As a New Jersey-charted commercial bank and an FDIC-insured institution, acquisitions by the Bank require approval of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the &#8220;Banking Department&#8221;) and the FDIC, an agency of the federal government. The Holding Company Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below, allows the Company to expand into insurance, securities, merchant banking activities, and other activities that are financial in nature, in certain circumstances. 

Regulation of Bank Subsidiary 

The operations of the Bank are subject to requirements and restrictions under federal law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be granted, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services which may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. There are various legal limitations, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to its holding company or its holding company&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries and affiliates. Under federal law, a bank subsidiary may only make loans or extensions of credit to, or investment in the securities of, its parent or the non-bank subsidiaries of its parent (other than direct subsidiaries of such bank which are not financial subsidiaries) or to any affiliate, or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower, upon satisfaction of various regulatory criteria, including specific collateral loan to value requirements. 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act, adopted in 2010, will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, as a result of the significant regulatory and compliance changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, including, among other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority over troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iv) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (v) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness for, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the FRB, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. A summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is set forth below: 

&#9679; Minimum Capital Requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act requires new capital rules and the application of the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies. In addition to making bank holding companies subject to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries, these provisions (often referred to as the Collins Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act) were also intended to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking regulators to seek to make capital standards countercyclical, so that the required levels of capital increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction. See &#8220;Capital Adequacy Guidelines&#8221; for a description of capital requirements adopted by U.S. federal banking regulators in 2013 and the treatment of trust preferred securities under such rules. - 7 - 

&#9679; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;Bureau&#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act created the Bureau within the FRB. The Bureau is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services. The Bureau has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the Bureau and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the Bureau against state-chartered institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. &#160; &#9679; Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act also revise the assessment base against which an insured depository institution&#8217;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) will be calculated. Under the amendments, the assessment base will no longer be the institution&#8217;s deposit base, but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. In December 2010, the FDIC increased the designated reserve ratio to 2.0 percent. &#160; &#9679; Shareholder Votes . The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies like the Company to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments in certain circumstances. The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates using a company&#8217;s proxy materials. The SEC has not yet adopted such rules. Although a significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, many of the new requirements called for have yet to be implemented and will likely be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions&#8217; operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements (which, in turn, could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional capital) or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. 

Regulation W 

Regulation W codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretative guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank&#8217;s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. The Company is considered to be an affiliate of the Bank. In general, subject to certain specified exemptions, a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with affiliates: 

&#9679; to an amount equal to 10% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate; and &#160; &#9679; to an amount equal to 20% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates In addition, a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and other specified transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. A &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes: 

&#9679; a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; &#160; &#9679; a purchase of, or an investment in, securities issued by an affiliate; - 8 - 

&#9679; a purchase of assets from an affiliate, with some exceptions; &#160; &#9679; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party; and &#160; &#9679; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. Further, under Regulation W: 

&#9679; a bank and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low-quality asset from an affiliate; &#160; &#9679; covered transactions and other specified transactions between a bank or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices; and &#160; &#9679; with some exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by a bank to an affiliate must be secured by certain types of collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130%, depending on the type of collateral, of the amount of the loan or extension of credit Regulation W generally excludes all non-bank and non-savings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the FRB decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates. 

FDICIA 

Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations, specifying the levels at which an insured depository institution such as the Bank would be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; and to take certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. To qualify to engage in financial activities under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, all depository institutions must be &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; 

The FDIC&#8217;s regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that an institution will be classified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent, has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.5%, and (v) does not meet the definition of &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; An institution will be classified as &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution will be classified as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent, or (iv) has a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less 3.0%. An institution will be classified as &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. 

In addition, significant provisions of FDICIA required federal banking regulators to impose standards in a number of other important areas to assure bank safety and soundness, including internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, credit underwriting, asset growth, compensation, loan documentation and interest rate exposure. 

Capital Adequacy Guidelines 

In December 2010 and January 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) published the final texts of reforms on capital and liquidity generally referred to as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; In July 2013, the FRB, the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency adopted final rules (the &#8220;New Rules&#8221;), which implement certain provisions of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act. The New Rules replaced the existing general risk-based capital rules of the various banking agencies with a single, integrated regulatory capital framework. The New Rules require higher capital cushions and more stringent criteria for what qualifies as regulatory capital. The New Rules were effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015. 

Under the New Rules, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets: 

&#9679; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% ( the &#8220;CET1&#148;); &#160; &#9679; Tier 1 Capital Ratio (CET1 capital plus &#147;Additional Tier 1 capital&#148;) of 6.0%; and &#160; &#9679; Total Capital Ratio (Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) of 8.0%. - 9 - 

In addition, the Company and the Bank will be subject to a leverage ratio of 4% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on the consolidated financial statements). 

The New Rules also require a &#147;capital conservation buffer.&#148; When fully phased in on January 1 2019, the Company and the Bank will be required to maintain a 2.5% capital conservation buffer, which is composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios described above, resulting in the following minimum capital ratios: 

&#9679; CET1 of 7%; &#160; 

&#9679; Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 8.5%; and &#160; 

&#9679; Total Capital Ratio of 10.5%. 

The purpose of the capital conservation buffer is to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a CET1, Tier 1 Capital Ratio and Total Capital Ratio above the minimum set forth above but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on their ability to pay dividends, repurchase equity and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, based on the amount of the shortfall. 

The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level, and it increases by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1 until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

The New Rules provide for several deductions from and adjustments to CET1, which are being phased in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018. For example, mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one of those categories exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. 

Under the New Rules, banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank may make a one-time permanent election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income items in determining regulatory capital ratios. Effective as of January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income items for purposes of determining regulatory capital. 

While the New Rules generally require the phase-out of non-qualifying capital instruments such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, holding companies with less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, may permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature. 

The New Rules prescribe a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Depending on the nature of the assets, the risk categories generally range from 0% for U.S. Government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the New Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation. 

Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the New Rules adopt alternatives to credit ratings for calculating the risk-weighting for certain assets. 

Federal Deposit Insurance and Premiums 

Substantially all of the deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. 

The assessment base for deposit insurance premiums is an institution&#146;s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. In connection with adopting this assessment base calculation, the FDIC lowered total base assessment rates to between 2.5 and 9 basis points for banks in the lowest risk category, and 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. The Company paid $2.1 million in total FDIC assessments in 2015, as compared to $1.6 million in 2014. 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC has not yet announced how it will implement this offset. 

In addition to deposit insurance assessments, the FDIC is required to continue to collect from institutions payments for the servicing of obligations of the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;) that were issued in connection with the resolution of savings and loan associations, so long as such obligations remain outstanding. The Bank paid a FICO premium of $189,100 in 2015.

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (the &#147;Modernization Act&#148;): 

&#9679; allows bank holding companies meeting management, capital, and Community Reinvestment Act standards to engage in a substantially broader range of non-banking activities than previously was permissible, including insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in commercial and financial companies, if the bank holding company elects to become a financial holding company, it files a certification, effective in 30 days, and thereafter may engage in certain financial activities without further approvals; &#160; 

&#9679; allows insurers and other financial services companies to acquire banks; &#160; 

&#9679; removes various restrictions that previously applied to bank holding company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory companies; and &#160; 

&#9679; establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities operations. 

The Modernization Act also modified other financial laws, including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment. The Company has elected not to become a financial holding company. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#147;CRA&#148;), as implemented by FDIC regulations, an insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#146;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC, in connection with its examination of every bank, to assess the bank&#146;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such bank. 

USA PATRIOT Act 

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#147;USA PATRIOT Act&#148;) gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through domestic security measures, surveillance powers, information sharing, and anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act encourages information-sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrift institutions, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 

Among other requirements, the USA PATRIOT Act imposes the following requirements with respect to financial institutions: 

&#9679; All financial institutions must establish anti-money laundering programs that include, at a minimum: (i) internal policies, procedures, and controls; (ii) specific designation of an anti-money laundering compliance officer; (iii) ongoing employee training programs; and (iv) an independent audit function to test the anti-money laundering program. &#160; 

&#9679; The Secretary of the Department of Treasury, in conjunction with other bank regulators, is authorized to issue regulations that provide for minimum standards with respect to customer identification at the time new accounts are opened. &#160; 

&#9679; Financial institutions that establish, maintain, administer, or manage private banking accounts or correspondent accounts in the United States for non-United States persons or their representatives (including foreign individuals visiting the United States) are required to establish appropriate, specific and, where necessary, enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls designed to detect and report money laundering. &#160; 

&#9679; Financial institutions are prohibited from establishing, maintaining, administering or managing correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks (foreign banks that do not have a physical presence in any country), and will be subject to certain record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. &#160; 

&#9679; Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company&#146;s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Federal Reserve Act and Bank Merger Act applications.

The United States Treasury Department has issued a number of implementing regulations which address various requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act and are applicable to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. 

SBLF 

On September 15, 2011, the Company issued to the Treasury a total of 11,250 shares of the Company&#146;s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the &#147;SBLF Preferred Stock&#148;), having a liquidation value of $1,000 per share, for a total purchase price of $11,250,000 as part of the Treasury&#146;s Small Business Lending Fund program (&#147;SBLF&#148;). 

The SBLF Preferred Stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital. Non-cumulative dividends are payable quarterly on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 for the SBLF Preferred Stock, commencing on January 1, 2012. The dividend rate is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate liquidation value of the outstanding SBLF Preferred Stock and is based on changes in the level of &#147;Qualified Small Business Lending&#148; or &#147;QSBL&#148; by the Bank The dividend rate on the SBLF Preferred Stock was set at five percent for the initial dividend period. 

For the second through tenth calendar quarters after the closing of the SBLF Program transaction, the dividend rate will fluctuate between one percent and five percent to reflect the amount of change in the Bank&#146;s level of QSBL. More specifically, if the Bank&#146;s QSBL at the end of a quarter has increased as compared to the baseline, then the dividend rate payable on the SBLF Preferred Stock would change as follows: 

Dividend Rate Relative Increase in QSBL to Baseline &#160; (for each of the 2 nd &#150; 10 th Dividend Periods) 0% or less 5 % More than 0%, but less than 2.5% &#160; 5 % 2.5% or more, but less than 5% 4 % 5% or more, but less than 7.5% 3 % 7.5% or more, but less than 10% 2 % 10% or more 1 % 

From the eleventh through the eighteenth calendar quarters and that portion of the nineteenth calendar quarter which ends immediately prior to the date that is the four and one half years anniversary of the closing of the SBLF Program transaction, the dividend rate on the SBLF Preferred Stock will be fixed at between one percent and seven percent based on the level of QSBL at that time, as compared to the baseline in accordance with the chart below. If any SBLF Preferred Stock remains outstanding after four and one half years following the closing of the SBLF Program transaction, the dividend rate will increase to nine percent. In our case, the dividend rate on the SBLF Preferred Stock will increase to 9.0% on March 15, 2016. 

0% or less 

7 % More than 0%, but less than 2.5% 5 % 2.5% or more, but less than 5% 4 % 5% or more, but less than 7.5% 3 % 7.5% or more, but less than 10% 2 % 10% or more 1 % 

The SBLF Preferred Stock is non-voting, except in limited circumstances that could impact the SBLF investment, such as (i) authorization of senior stock, (ii) charter amendments adversely affecting the SBLF Preferred Stock and (iii) extraordinary transactions such as mergers, asset sales, share exchanges and the like (unless the SBLF Preferred Stock remains outstanding and the rights and preferences thereof are not impaired by such transaction). 

In the event the Company misses five dividend payments, whether or not consecutive, the holder of the SBLF Preferred Stock will have the right, but not the obligation, to appoint a representative as an &#147;observer&#148; on the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. 

Further, the SBLF Preferred Stock may be redeemed by the Company at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the liquidation amount plus accrued but unpaid dividends for the then current Dividend Period, subject to the approval of the Company&#146;s federal banking regulator. 

The SBLF Preferred Stock is not subject to any contractual restrictions on transfer and thus the Secretary may sell, transfer, exchange or enter into other transactions with respect to the SBLF Preferred Stock without the Company&#146;s consent. 

The Company expects to repurchase all outstanding $11.25 million SBLF preferred stock by March 31, 2016.

Loans to Related Parties 

The Company&#146;s authority to extend credit to its directors and executive officers, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation O promulgated by the FRB. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank&#146;s capital. In addition, the Bank&#146;s Board of Directors must approve extensions of credit in excess of certain limits. 

Dividend Restrictions 

The Parent Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Virtually all of the revenue of the Parent Corporation available for payment of dividends on its capital stock will result from amounts paid to the Parent Corporation by the Bank. All such dividends are subject to the laws of the state of New Jersey, the Banking Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#147;FDIA&#148;) and the regulation of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and of the FDIC. 

Under the New Jersey Corporation Act, the Parent Corporation is permitted to pay cash dividends provided that the payment does not leave us insolvent. As a bank holding company under the BHCA, we would be prohibited from paying cash dividends if we are not in compliance with any capital requirements applicable to us. However, as a practical matter, for so long as our major operations consist of ownership of the Bank, the Bank will remain our source of dividend payments, and our ability to pay dividends will be subject to any restrictions applicable to the Bank. 

Under the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended, dividends may be paid by the Bank only if, after the payment of the dividend, the capital stock of the Bank will be unimpaired and either the Bank will have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock or the payment of the dividend will not reduce the Bank&#146;s surplus. The payment of dividends is also dependent upon the Bank&#146;s ability to maintain adequate capital ratios pursuant to applicable regulatory requirements. 

The terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock discussed above impose limits on the Company&#146;s ability to pay dividends on and repurchase shares of its common stock and other securities. More specifically, if the Company fails to declare and pay dividends on the SBLF Preferred Stock in a given quarter, then during such quarter and for the next three quarters following such missed dividend payment, the Company may not pay dividends on, or repurchase, any common stock or any other securities that are junior to (or in parity with) the SBLF Preferred Stock, except in very limited circumstances. 

Also under the terms of the SBLF Preferred Stock, the Company may declare and pay dividends on its common stock or any other stock junior to the SBLF Preferred Stock, or repurchase shares of any such stock, only if after payment of such dividends or repurchase of such shares, the Company&#146;s Tier 1 Capital would be at least equal to the so-called Tier 1 Dividend Threshold, excluding any subsequent net charge-offs and any redemption of the SBLF Preferred Stock. 

The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the FRB&#146;s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization&#146;s capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition. FRB regulations also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized, and under regulations implementing the Basel III accord, a bank holding company&#146;s ability to pay cash dividends may be impaired if it fails to satisfy certain capital buffer requirements. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
