 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

ACI Worldwide, Inc. (&#147;ACI&#148;, &#147;ACI Worldwide&#148;, the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; or &#147;our&#148;) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in November 1993 under the name ACI Holding, Inc. ACI is largely the successor to Applied Communications, Inc. and Applied Communications Inc. Limited, which we acquired from Tandem Computers Incorporated on December 31, 1993. On July 24, 2007, we changed our corporate name from &#147;Transaction Systems Architects, Inc.&#148; to &#147;ACI Worldwide, Inc.&#148; We have been marketing our products and services under the ACI Worldwide brand since 1993 and have gained significant market recognition under this brand name. 

We develop, market, install and support a broad line of software products and services primarily focused on facilitating electronic payments. In addition to our own products, we distribute or act as a sales agent for software developed by third parties. These products and services are used principally by financial institutions, retailers, billers and electronic payment processors, both in domestic and international markets. Most of our products are sold and supported through distribution networks covering three geographic regions &#150; the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (&#147;EMEA&#148;) and Asia/Pacific. Each distribution network has its own sales force that it supplements with independent reseller and/or distributor networks. 

The electronic payments market is comprised of financial institutions, retailers, billers, third-party electronic payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including automated teller machines (&#147;ATM&#148;), retail merchant locations, bank branches, mobile phones, corporations and Internet commerce sites. The authentication, authorization, switching, settlement and reconciliation of electronic payments is a complex activity due to the large number of locations and variety of sources from which transactions can be generated, the large number of participants in the market, high transaction volumes, geographically dispersed networks, differing types of authorization, and varied reporting requirements. These activities are typically performed online and are often conducted 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

ACI combines a global perspective with local presence to tailor electronic payment solutions for our customers. We believe that we have one of the most diverse and robust product portfolios in the bill payments industry with application software spanning the entire payments value chain. We also believe that our strong financial performance has been attributable to our ability to design and deliver quality products coupled with our ability to identify and successfully consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions.

Our ACI Payments Solution vision recognized the long term direction to migrate payments processing from the discrete structures to a set of service-based enterprise payments solutions.

We continued to evolve our solution offerings in a way that organizations can benefit from the integrated and enterprise capabilities of the entire ACI product portfolio as we provided the market with a comprehensive set of payment solutions covering a wide range of needs. As we progressed on this journey we made significant investments to accelerate the delivery for our customers through both internal development and acquisition. Notably in 2012, ACI acquired S1 Corporation and Distra Pty Ltd., both of which expanded the breadth and scale of ACI&#146;s offerings, as well as accelerated the delivery of our technology vision to the marketplace. The EBPP related acquisitions in 2013 further added to our payments products portfolio and added assets that both allow us to provide a wider set of payments solutions to new market segments and complement our existing solutions, the 2014 acquisition of ReD further strengthened our position in the payment risk management space, while the 2015 acquisition of PAY.ON complements and strengthens ACI&#146;s UP Retailer Payments solution, positioning ACI as a highly differentiated omni-channel payment leader. Our strategy allows ACI to deliver an end-to-end payment system that supports any payment type, device or channel globally. During 2013 this comprehensive view of our payments capabilities, technologies and solutions was rebranded as Universal Payments. Universal Payments, or &#147;UP&#148; now describes the breadth and depth of ACI&#146;s product offerings. UP defines ACI&#146;s true enterprise or &#147;universal&#148; payments capabilities targeting any channel, any network, and any payment type.

Retail Banking Payments &#150; Payments Processing 

Our retail payments processing products are designed to acquire electronic payment transactions from transaction generators and route them to acquiring institutions so that they can be authorized for payment. The software often interfaces with regional or national switches to access the account-holding financial institution or card issuer for approval or denial of the transactions (authorization). The software returns messages to the original transaction generator (e.g. an ATM), thereby completing the transactions. Depending on how the software is configured, it can perform all of the functions necessary to authenticate, authorize, route and settle an electronic payment transaction, or it can interact with other systems to ensure that these functions are performed. Payments processing software may be required to interact with dozens of devices, switch interchanges and communication protocols around the world. We currently offer the following products for this domain: 

BASE24-eps is an integrated electronic payments processing product marketed to customers operating electronic payment networks in the retail banking and retail industries.

Partnerships and Industry Participation 

We have two major types of third-party partners: technology partners, where we work closely with industry leaders who drive key industry trends and mandates, and business partners, where we either embed technology in ACI products or jointly market solutions that include the products of other companies. 

Technology partners help us add value to our solutions, stay abreast of current market conditions and industry developments such as standards. Technology partner organizations include Diebold, NCR, Wincor-Nixdorf, VISA, MasterCard and SWIFT.

These partnerships provide direction as it relates to the specifications that are used by the card schemes and in some cases manufacturers.

The benefit to ACI is in having the opportunity to imprint these standards with concepts and ideas that will benefit ACI and ultimately our customers. 

Business partner relationships extend our product portfolio, improve our ability to get our solutions to market and enhance our ability to deliver market-leading solutions.

&#160; &#149; &#160; ThreatMetrix, Inc. Services 

We offer our customers a wide range of professional services, including analysis, design, development, implementation, integration and training. We have service professionals within each of our three geographic regions who generally perform the majority of the work associated with installing and integrating our software products. In addition, we work with a limited number of systems integration and services partners, such as Accenture, Cognizant and Stanchion, for staff augmentation and coordinated co-prime delivery where appropriate. We offer the following types of services for our customers: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Implementation Services. We utilize a standard methodology to deliver customer project implementations across all products lines. Within the process, we provide customers with a variety of services, including on-site solution scoping reviews, project planning, training, site preparation, installation, product configuration, product customization, testing and go-live support, and project management throughout the project lifecycle. Implementation services are typically priced according to the level of technical expertise required. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Product support services. These product-support-funded services are available to customers after a solution has been installed and are based on the relevant product support category. An extensive team of support analysts are available to assist customers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Technical Services. Our technical services are provided to customers who have licensed one or more of our software products. Services offered include programming and programming support, day-to-day systems operations, network operations, help desk staffing, quality assurance testing, problem resolution, system design, and performance planning and review. Technical services are typically priced according to the level of technical expertise required. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Education Services . ACI courses include both theory and practical sessions to allow students to work though real business scenarios and put their newly learned skills to use. This hands-on approach ensures that the knowledge is retained and the student is more productive upon their return to the workplace. ACI&#146;s education courses provide students with knowledge at all levels, to enhance and improve their understanding of ACI products. ACI also provides further, more in-depth technical courses that allow students to use practical labs to enhance what they have learned in the classroom. The ACI trainers&#146; ability to understand customers&#146; systems means ACI can also provide tailored course materials for individual customers. Depending upon products purchased, training may be conducted at a dedicated education facility at one of ACI&#146;s offices, online, or at the customer site. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Testing services . ACI&#146;s testing services team works within the ACI customer base to establish testing best practices and build a standard testing environment that meets an organization&#146;s current needs, and is easily extensible for future requirements. It is important that any testing environment encompasses all aspects of the testing lifecycle (i.e., functional, acceptance, regression and stress testing), as well as allowing ease of use by the appropriate staff. ACI&#146;s testing services can provide this environment as either a stand-alone deliverable or as a fully managed service. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expert Services Consultancy . ACI is committed to providing high-quality consulting services to its customer base. In order to do this, we have assembled a strong team of technicians with many decades of experience, not only with ACI solutions, but also in the payments industry in general. Trusted globally, these consultants are available to provide technical assistance to ACI&#146;s customers across the full range of the ACI portfolio. The consultants&#146; knowledge and understanding of ACI&#146;s customers allow them to define, design, and build appropriate technical solutions. This in turn provides an enhanced business offering to customers, ultimately enabling a greater competitive advantage and increased satisfaction. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Facilities Management Services. We offer facilities management services whereby we operate a customer&#146;s electronic payments system for multi-year periods. Pricing and payment terms for facilities management services vary on a case-by-case basis giving consideration to the complexity of the facility or system to be managed, the level and quantity of technical services required, and other factors relevant to the facilities management agreement. ACI On Demand 

We offer SaaS hosting service whereby we host a customer&#146;s system for them as opposed to the customer licensing and installing the system on their own site. We offer several of our solutions in this manner, including our retail and wholesale payment engines, risk management, biller, retailers and online banking products. ACI On Demand customers are served in both multi-tenant and dedicated instance software operating models depending on the solution tailored to meet their specific needs. The product is generally located on facilities and hardware that we provide. Pricing and payment terms depend on which solutions the customer requires and their transaction volumes. Generally, customers are required to commit to a minimum contract of three to five years. 

Customer Support 

We provide our customers with product support that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If requested by a customer, the product support group can remotely access that customer&#146;s systems on a real-time basis. This allows the product support group to help diagnose and correct problems to enhance the continuous availability of a customer&#146;s business-critical systems. We offer our customers both a general maintenance plan and a premium option. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; General Maintenance. After software installation and project completion, we provide maintenance services to customers for a monthly product support fee. Maintenance services include: &#160;

Agreements with our customers permit us to charge for substantial product enhancements that are not provided as part of the maintenance agreement. 

Competition 

The electronic payments market is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Competitive factors affecting the market for our products and services include product features, price, availability of customer support, ease of implementation, product and company reputation, and a commitment to continued investment in research and development. 

Our competitors vary by product line, geography and market segment. Generally, our most significant competition comes from in-house information technology departments of existing and potential customers, as well as third-party electronic payments processors (some of whom are our customers). Many of these companies are significantly larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. Key competitors by product domain include the following: 

Online Banking and Cash Management, Branch, Trade Finance, and Community Financial Services 

Principal competitors for the Online Banking and Cash Management and Branch product set are Digital Insight, Bottomline Technologies, ARGO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and Fundtech Ltd, as well as payment processing companies First Data Corporation, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc, and Fiserv, Inc. Principal competitors for the Community Financial Services product set are Fiserv, Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Jack Henry &#38; Associates, Inc., Q2 Software, Inc., Intuit Inc., and Alkami Technology. 

Retail Banking Payments 

The third-party software competitors for the products in the retail banking payments are Clear2Pay, Computer Sciences Corporation, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Pegasystems Inc., OpenWay Group, and Total System Services, Inc. (&#147;TSYS&#148;), as well as small, regionally-focused companies such as Alaric Technology, Inc., BPC Banking Technologies, PayEx Solutions AS, Financial Software and Systems, CR2, Lusis Payments Ltd., and Opus Software Solutions Private Limited. Primary electronic payment processing competitors in this area include global entities such as Atos Origin S.A., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., First Data Corporation, SiNSYS, TSYS, VISA and MasterCard, as well as regional or country-specific processors. 

Transaction Banking Payments 

In the wholesale banking payments the principal competitors are Bankserv, FIS/Clear2Pay, Dovetail Software, Fundtech Ltd, IBM, Logica Plc, and Tieto Corporation. 

Retailers 

Competitors in the retail sector come from both third-party software and service providers as well as service organizations run by major banks. Third-party software and service competitors include AJB Software Design, Inc., Retalix, Heartland Payment Systems, Inc., Ingenico Group, Adyen, Worldpay, GlobalCollect, Cybersource, Square, Tender Retail Inc., and VeriFone Systems, Inc. Primary competition in this space are large third-party acquirer/processors and payment service providers that offer complete solutions to the retailer. 

&#160;

Payments Risk Management 

Principal competitors for the payments fraud detection products are Actimize, Inc., Fair Isaac Corporation, BAE Systems Detica, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Fiserv, Inc., SAS Institute, Inc., Accertify (American Express) and Cybersource (Visa), as well as dozens of smaller companies focused on niches of this segment such as anti-money laundering. 

Payments Infrastructure 

The principal competitors for the tools and infrastructure products are CA Technologies, HP, IBM, Oracle USA, Inc., FirstData and Openway as well as dozens of small, niche-focused competitors. 

As markets continue to evolve in the electronic payments, risk management and smartcard sectors, we may encounter new competitors for our products and services. As electronic payment transaction volumes increase and banks face price competition, third-party processors may become stronger competition in our efforts to market our solutions to smaller financial institutions. In the larger financial institution market, we believe that third-party processors may be less competitive since large institutions attempt to differentiate their electronic payment product offerings from their competition, and are more likely to develop or continue to support their own internally-developed solutions or use third-party services and payment connectivity such as those we offer. 

Bill Payment 

The principal competitors for bill payment are Fiserv, Inc., Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., Jack Henry &#38; Associates, Inc., Western Union Holdings, Inc., TouchNet Information Systems, Inc., Kubra Customer Interaction Management, WorldPay, Inc., Forte Payment Systems, Point &#38; Pay, LLC, Nelnet, Inc. and Affiliates, Higher One, Inc., Paymentus Corp., Aliaswire Inc., and Invoice Cloud, Inc., as well as smaller vertical specific providers. 

Research and Development 

Our product development efforts focus on new products and improved versions of existing products. We facilitate user group meetings to help us determine our product strategy, development plans and aspects of customer support. The user groups are generally organized geographically or by product lines. We believe that the timely development of new applications and enhancements is essential to maintain our competitive position in the market. 

During the development of new products, we work closely with our customers and industry leaders to determine requirements. We work with device manufacturers, such as Diebold, NCR and Wincor-Nixdorf, to ensure compatibility with the latest ATM technology. We work with network vendors, such as MasterCard, VISA and SWIFT, to ensure compliance with new regulations or processing mandates. We work with computer hardware and software manufacturers, such as HP, IBM, Microsoft Corporation and Oracle to ensure compatibility with new operating system releases and generations of hardware. Customers often provide additional information on requirements and serve as beta-test partners. 

We have a continuous process to encourage and capture innovative product ideas. Such ideas include features as well as entire new products or service offerings. A Proof of Concept (POC) may be conducted in order to validate the idea. If determined to be viable, the innovation is scheduled into a Product Roadmap for development and release. 

Our total research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $145.9 million, $144.2 million, and $142.6 million, or 14%, 14%, and 16% of total revenues, respectively. 

Customers

As of December 31, 2015, we serve over 5,000 customers, including 18 of the top 20 banks worldwide, as measured by asset size, and more than 300 of the leading retailers globally, as measured by revenue, in over 80 countries on six continents.

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

&#160;

In addition, we use distributors and referral partners to supplement our direct sales force in countries where business practices or customs make it appropriate, or where it is more economical to do so.

We distribute the products of other vendors where they complement our existing product lines. We are typically responsible for the sales and marketing of the vendor&#146;s products, and agreements with these vendors generally provide for revenue sharing based on relative responsibilities. 

Headquartered in Naples, Florida, we have principal United States sales offices in Norcross, Omaha, Princeton and Waltham. In addition, we have sales offices located outside the United States in Athens, Bahrain, Bangkok, Beijing, Bogota, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Caracas, Dubai, Gouda, Johannesburg, Kuala Lumpur, Madrid, Manila, Melbourne, Mexico City, Milan, Montevideo, Moscow, Mumbai, Munich, Naples, Paris, Quito, Riyadh, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, Singapore, Stockholm, Sulzbach, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, and Watford. 

Proprietary Rights and Licenses 

We rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, license agreements, contractual provisions, and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that typically grant customers nonexclusive licenses to use our products. Use of our software products is usually restricted to designated computers, specified locations and/or specified capacity, and is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our software products. We also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our software products and technology will not occur. 

In addition to our own products, we distribute, or act as a sales agent for, software developed by third parties. However, we typically are not involved in the development process used by these third parties. Our rights to those third-party products and the associated intellectual property rights are limited by the terms of the contractual agreement between us and the respective third-party. 

Although we believe that our owned and licensed intellectual property rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Further, there can be no assurance that intellectual property protection will be available for our products in all foreign countries. 

Like many companies in the electronic commerce and other high-tech industries, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to business processes, technologies and related standards that are relevant to us and our customers. These assertions have increased over time as a result of the general increase in patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Third parties may also claim that the third-party&#146;s intellectual property rights are being infringed by our customers&#146; use of a business process method that utilizes products in conjunction with other products, which could result in indemnification claims against us by our customers. Any claim against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product delivery delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or pay amounts in settlement, or require us to develop alternative non-infringing technology. We could also be required to defend or indemnify our customers against such claims. A successful claim by a third-party of intellectual property infringement by us or one of our customers could compel us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements, pay significant damages or even stop selling certain products and incur additional costs to develop alternative non-infringing technology. 

Segment Information and Foreign Operations 

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from foreign operations. For detail of revenue by geographic region see Note 10, Segment Information , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of approximately 4,576 employees of whom 2,425 were in the Americas reportable segment, 1,217 were in the EMEA reportable segment and 934 were in the Asia/Pacific reportable segment. 

None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 

Available Information 

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), are
