 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview 

Resources Connection is a multinational consulting firm; its operating entities primarily provide services under the name Resources Global Professionals (&#147;RGP&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;). The Company provides consulting and business initiative support services to its global client base in the areas of accounting; finance; corporate governance, risk and compliance management; corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring; information management; human capital; supply chain management; and legal and regulatory. 

We assist our clients by providing &#147;intellectual capital on demand&#148; to support projects requiring specialized expertise in areas such as: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Finance and accounting services including process transformation and improvement; financial reporting and analysis; technical and operational accounting; merger and acquisition due diligence; audit response; implementation of new accounting standards such as the revenue recognition pronouncement; and remediation support &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Information management services including strategy development; program and project management; business and technology integration; data strategy including security and privacy; and business performance management (such as core planning and consolidation systems) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring services &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Corporate governance, risk and compliance management services including contract and regulatory compliance efforts under, for example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (&#147;Sarbanes&#148;); Enterprise Risk Management; internal controls management; and operation and information technology (&#147;IT&#148;) audits &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Supply chain management services including supply chain strategy development; procurement and supplier management; logistics and materials management; supply chain planning and forecasting; and Unique Device Identification compliance &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Human capital services including change management; organization development and effectiveness; and optimization of human resources technology and operations &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Legal and regulatory services with projects, secondments or tactical needs including commercial transactions; compliance initiatives; law department operations; and business strategy and litigation support We were founded in June 1996 by a team at Deloitte LLP (&#147;Deloitte&#148;), led by our chairman, Donald B. Murray, who was then a senior partner with Deloitte. Our founders created the Company to capitalize on the increasing demand for high quality outsourced professional services. We operated as a part of Deloitte until April 1999. In April 1999, we completed a management-led buyout. In December 2000, we completed our initial public offering of common stock and began trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. We currently trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We operate under the acronym RGP, the branding for our operating entity name of Resources Global Professionals. 

Our business model combines the client service orientation and commitment to quality from our legacy as part of a Big Four accounting firm with the entrepreneurial culture of an innovative, dynamic company. We are positioned to take advantage of what we believe are two continuing trends in the outsourced professional services industry: global demand for flexible, outsourced professional services by corporate clients and highly-experienced professionals interested in working in a non-traditional professional services firm. We believe our business model allows us to simultaneously offer challenging yet flexible career opportunities to attract well qualified, experienced professionals and to attract clients with enterprise-wide, global consulting needs. 

As of May 28, 2016, we employed or contracted with 2,511 consultants serving a diverse base of over 1,800 clients ranging from large multinational corporations to mid-sized companies to small entrepreneurial entities, in a broad range of industries. Our 

&#160;

consultants have professional experience in a wide range of industries and functional areas and tend to be in the latter third of their careers, many with advanced professional degrees or designations. We offer our consultants careers that combine the flexibility of project-based consulting work with many of the advantages of working for a traditional professional services firm. 

Our offices serve our multinational clients throughout the world with a client focus rather than from a regional/office perspective. To enhance our ability to serve multinational clients, we served our clients from 45 offices in the United States and from 23 offices within 19 countries abroad as of May 28, 2016. 

Revenue from the Company&#146;s major geographic areas was as follows (in thousands):

We believe our distinctive culture is a valuable asset and is, in large part, due to our management team, which has extensive experience in the professional services industry. Most of our senior management and office managing directors have Big Four, management consulting and/or Fortune 500 experience and an equity interest in the Company. This team has created a culture of professionalism and a client service orientation that we believe fosters in our consultants a feeling of personal responsibility for, and pride in, client projects and enables us to deliver high-quality service and results to our clients. 

Industry Background 

Changing Market for Project- or Initiative-Based Professional Services 

RGP&#146;s services cover a range of professional areas. The market for professional services is broad and fragmented and independent data on the size of the market is not readily available. We believe that companies may be more willing to choose alternatives to traditional professional service providers because of evolving economic competitive pressure and significant increases in government-led regulatory requirements, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We believe RGP is positioned as a viable alternative to traditional accounting, consulting and law firms in numerous instances because, by using project consultants, companies can: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Strategically access specialized skills and expertise &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Effectively supplement internal resources &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Increase labor flexibility &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Reduce their overall hiring, training and termination costs Typically, companies use a variety of alternatives to fill their project needs. Companies outsource entire projects to consulting firms which provides them access to the expertise of the firm but often entails significant cost and less management control of the project. Companies also supplement their internal resources with employees from the Big Four accounting firms or other traditional professional services firms. Companies use temporary employees from traditional and Internet-based staffing firms, although these employees may be less experienced or less qualified than employees from professional services firms. Finally, some companies rely solely on their own employees who may lack the requisite time, experience or skills. 

&#160;

Supply of Project Consultants 

Based on discussions with our consultants, we believe that the number of professionals seeking to work on a project basis has historically increased due to a desire for: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; More flexible hours and work arrangements, coupled with a professional culture that offers competitive wages and benefits &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Challenging engagements that advance their careers, develop their skills and add to their experience base &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A work environment that provides a diversity of, and more control over, client engagements &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Alternate employment opportunities in regions throughout the world The employment alternatives available to professionals may fulfill some, but not all, of an individual&#146;s career objectives. A professional working for a Big Four firm or a consulting firm may receive challenging assignments and training, but may encounter a career path with less choice and less flexible hours, extensive travel and limited control over work engagements. Alternatively, a professional who works as an independent contractor faces the ongoing task of sourcing assignments and significant administrative burdens. 

Resources Global Professionals&#146; Solution 

We believe that RGP is positioned to capitalize on the confluence of the industry trends described above. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, that RGP provides high-quality services to clients seeking project professionals because we are able to combine all of the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A relationship-oriented and collaborative approach with our clients &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Client service teams with Big Four, consulting and/or industry backgrounds to assess our clients&#146; project needs and customize solutions to meet those needs &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Highly qualified consultants with the requisite expertise and experience &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Competitive rates on an hourly, rather than project, basis &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Significant client control of their projects Resources Global Professionals&#146; Strategy 

Our Business Strategy 

We are dedicated to serving our clients with highly qualified and experienced professionals in support of projects and initiatives in the areas of accounting; finance; corporate governance, risk and compliance management; corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring; information management; human capital; supply chain management; and legal and regulatory. Our objective is to be the leading provider of these project-based professional services. We have developed the following business strategies to achieve this objective: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maintain our distinctive culture. Our corporate culture is the foundation of our business strategy and we believe it has been a significant component of our success. Our senior management, virtually all of whom are Big Four or other professional services firm alumni, has created a culture that combines the commitment to quality and the client service focus of a Big Four firm with the entrepreneurial energy of an innovative, high-growth company. We seek consultants and management with talent, integrity, enthusiasm and loyalty (&#147;TIEL&#148;, an acronym used frequently within the Company) to strengthen our team and support our ability to provide clients with high-quality services and solutions. We believe that our culture has been instrumental to our success in hiring and retaining highly qualified employees and, in turn, attracting quality clients. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hire and retain highly qualified, experienced consultants. We believe our highly qualified, experienced consultants provide us with a distinct competitive advantage. Therefore, one of our priorities is to continue to attract and retain high-caliber consultants. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified professionals by providing challenging work assignments, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing education and training opportunities, while offering flexible work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Build consultative relationships with clients. We emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business rather than a transaction-oriented or assignment-oriented approach. We believe the professional services experience of our management and consultants enables us to understand the needs of our clients and to deliver an integrated, relationship-oriented approach to meeting their professional services requirements. We regularly meet with our existing and prospective clients to understand their business issues and help them define their project needs. Once an initiative is defined, we identify consultants with the appropriate skills and experience to meet the client&#146;s objectives. We believe that by establishing relationships with our clients to solve their professional services needs, we are more likely to generate new opportunities to serve them. The strength and depth of our client relationships is demonstrated by two key statistics: 1) during fiscal 2016, 47 of our 50 largest clients used more than one practice area and 40 of those top 50 clients used three or more practice areas; and 2) 44 of our largest 50 clients in fiscal 2011 remained clients in fiscal 2016 while 39 of our top 50 clients in 2008 were still clients in 2016. In addition, during fiscal 2016 our top 50 clients were served by an average of six RGP offices, demonstrating the breadth of our relationships with clients world-wide. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Build the RGP brand. Our objective is to build RGP&#146;s reputation as the premier provider of project-based consulting services. Our primary means of building our brand is by consistently providing high-quality, value-added services to our clients. We have also focused on building a significant referral network through our 2,511 consultants and 772 management and administrative employees working from offices in 20 countries as of May 28, 2016. In addition, we have global, regional and local marketing efforts that reinforce the RGP brand. Our Growth Strategy 

Since inception, our growth has been primarily organic rather than via acquisition. We believe that we have significant opportunity for continued organic growth in our core business as the global economy strengthens and economic uncertainties decrease and that, in addition, we can grow opportunistically through strategic acquisitions. In both our core and acquired businesses, key elements of our growth strategy include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expanding work from existing clients. A principal component of our strategy is to secure additional work from the clients we have served. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, that the amount of revenue we currently receive from many of our clients represents a relatively small percentage of the amount they spend on professional services, and that, consistent with historic industry trends, they may continue to increase the amount they spend on these services as the global economy evolves. We believe that by continuing to deliver high-quality services and by further developing our relationships with our clients, we can capture a significantly larger share of our clients&#146; expenditures for professional services. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Growing our client base. We will continue to focus on attracting new clients. We strive to develop new client relationships primarily by leveraging the significant contact networks of our management and consultants and through referrals from existing clients. We believe we can continue to attract new clients by building our brand name and reputation, supplemented by our global, regional and local marketing efforts. We anticipate that our growth efforts this year will continue to focus on identifying strategic target accounts that tend to be large multinational companies. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expanding geographically. We have expanded geographically to meet the demand for project professional services around the world and currently have offices in 20 countries. We believe, based upon our clients&#146; requests, that there are future opportunities to promote growth globally. Consequently, we intend to continue to expand our international presence on a strategic and opportunistic basis. We may also add to our existing domestic office network when our existing clients have a need or if there is a new client opportunity. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Providing additional professional service offerings. We will continue to develop and consider entry into new professional service offerings. Since our founding, we have diversified our professional service offerings from a primary focus on accounting and finance to other areas in which our clients have significant needs such as human capital; information management; governance, risk and compliance; supply chain management; legal and regulatory services; and corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring services. Our considerations when evaluating new professional service offerings include cultural fit, growth potential, profitability, cross-marketing opportunities and competition. &#160;

Consultants 

We believe that an important component of our success has been our highly qualified and experienced consultants. As of May 28, 2016, we employed or contracted with 2,511 consultants engaged with clients. Our consultants have professional experience in a wide range of industries and functional areas. We provide our consultants with challenging work assignments, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing education and training opportunities, while offering more choice concerning work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements. 

Almost all of our consultants in the United States are employees of RGP. We typically pay each consultant an hourly rate for each consulting hour worked and for certain administrative time and overtime premiums, and offer benefits, including: paid time off and holidays; a discretionary bonus program; group medical and dental programs, each with an approximate 30-50% contribution by the consultant; a basic term life insurance program; a 401(k) retirement plan with a discretionary company match; and professional development and career training. Typically, a consultant must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of these benefits. In addition, we offer our consultants the ability to participate in the Company&#146;s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#147;ESPP&#148;), which enables them to purchase shares of the Company&#146;s stock at a discount. We intend to maintain competitive compensation and benefit programs. 

Internationally, our consultants are a blend of employees and independent contractors. Independent contractor arrangements are more common abroad than in the United States due to the labor laws, tax regulations and customs of the international markets we serve. A few international practices also utilize a partial &#147;bench model&#148;; that is, certain consultants are paid a weekly salary rather than for each consulting hour worked with bonus eligibility based upon utilization. 

Clients 

We provide our services and solutions to a diverse client base in a broad range of industries. In fiscal 2016, we served over 1,800 clients from offices located in 20 countries. Our revenues are not concentrated with any particular client or within any particular industry. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the years ended May 28, 2016, May 30, 2015 and May 31, 2014, and in fiscal 2016, our 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 15% of our revenues. 

The clients listed below represent the multinational and industry diversity of our client base:

RGP&#146;s business model and operating philosophy are rooted in the support of client-led projects and consulting initiatives, extending to advisory-based services that leverage the deep experience and expertise of our internal team while partnering with our clients&#146; business leaders.

Sample Engagement &#151; Revenue Recognition Assessment and Solution: A U.S. based national retailer engaged RGP to perform a full assessment and develop an implementation roadmap in order to comply with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#146;s revenue recognition guidance, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended . Using RGP&#146;s proprietary revenue recognition framework to determine the impact of the new guidance and to implement a solution, our consultants: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Evaluated the client&#146;s revenue streams and processes, conducted company-wide interviews and reviewed and documented a sample of revenue contracts &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Estimated the impact on the client&#146;s revenue and disclosures &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Assessed the client&#146;s system capabilities, designed solutions and documented inter-departmental dependencies, including timeline requirements &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Worked with the client to select the optimal implementation solutions and developed a robust implementation roadmap and work plan &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Facilitated on-going and comprehensive knowledge transfer to position the client for future compliance with the revenue recognition standard Sample Engagement &#151; Reorganization, Bankruptcy Support and Human Capital: A U.S. clothing manufacturer and retailer was unable to meet its financial obligations in 2015 and filed for chapter 11 protection in U.S. bankruptcy court. The client initially hired RGP for a three-week engagement to analyze and reconcile their critical vendor claims. It was important to complete this reconciliation quickly in order for the continued flow of product from their vendors. 

&#160;

The client&#146;s satisfaction with the initial project led to expansion of the engagement to include an analysis and reconciliation of 503(b)(9) supplier claims just prior to the bankruptcy filing, administration claims and bankruptcy court reporting, including monthly financial reports. 

Because of employee layoffs as well as employee attrition due to the chapter 11 filing, the company was unable to perform certain critical functions. RGP provided consultants to serve as interim controller; AP Manager; Budgeting Manager and HR Manager, including the handling of WARN Act notices, layoffs and COBRA matters. With RGP&#146;s support, the Company successfully exited bankruptcy and RGP continues to assist in the on-going reorganization. 

Sample Engagement &#151; Transition of Accounting Cycle Processes Following Significant Acquisition: A Fortune 500 retail company that recently completed a significant acquisition of a competitor embarked on a comprehensive program to recognize synergies from the overlap of certain back-office functions. Under a &#147;lift &#38; shift&#148; scenario, the client engaged RGP to assess the current state of revenue, cash and payables processes for the acquired company and to develop and execute a plan to transition those functions to the client&#146;s existing shared services centers around the world.

Sample Engagement &#151; Project Leadership for Global Next Generation Program: A Fortune 50 automotive company is implementing a global program to create the next generation of connected vehicle technology and infotainment applications for all North American vehicle production. The RGP team leads the coordination and integration of a highly complex set of services that requires the seamless integration of six external suppliers and eight internal teams, to create a new customer facing registration portal, secure global network and real-time interfaces needed to enable the new services. 

RGP consultants serve as technical Program Management across 13 defined workstreams as well as a variety of internal systems integrations that span enterprise infrastructure. The project also includes systems implementation in the form of architecture support and very complex systems integration across the 14 teams building the technology components. The RGP 

&#160;

Program Manager has managed the transition from vendor selection to solutioning and engineering the services with the supplier and client teams. RGP continues to be the technical systems integrator for all program workstreams and horizontal platforms. 

Sample Engagement &#151; Deployment of Third-Party Technology in Call Center: A major provider of entertainment programming needed assistance in deploying third-party technology. The technology allows system intelligent prioritization of customer telephone calls by providing real-time evaluation of customer call intention, comparing the intent with various attributes on file for the particular customer, and aligning customer calls with offers for cross-selling purposes. 

The RGP consulting team provided project management, executive stakeholder strategy, organizational change management, enterprise technology implementation and vendor management. In addition to reducing the time associated with each customer call and increasing revenue through targeted cross-sell techniques, our team led the implementation of a number of analytical tools for the business to use in evaluating retention and cross-sell strategies. 

Sample Engagement &#151; Integration and Optimization of Significant Acquisition: A large publicly-traded entertainment conglomerate acquired a regional entity that provided home security and monitoring. Our client needed to integrate its existing ordering, billing, supply chain and installation systems with the acquired entity&#146;s systems in order to sell and deliver these new capabilities across its current and prospective customer base. Working with the client&#146;s implementation team, RGP&#146;s activities included: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Serving as interim program manager and senior project manager &#160;

Examples of our core competencies include: 

Project Services 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Commercial agreement review &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Compliance support (FCPA, Dodd-Frank, data privacy) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Proxy and quarterly SEC support &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Corporate governance Sample Engagement &#151; Unbundling Support for M&#38;A Activity: Our client, a world leader in the in-flight entertainment and communication solutions business, turned to RGP for supplemental support and expertise in connection with a buy-side acquisition. The client&#146;s general counsel engaged us to supplement the bandwidth of the in-house team. Our consultants drove the diligence process, collaborated extensively with internal business units and, working closely with lead outside counsel who focused on the strategy and structure of the deal, assisted in the drafting of deal documents. The client reduced its legal spend by multi-sourcing the work needed to support the transaction.

&#160; &#149; &#160; Organizational design Sample Engagement &#151; Law Department Organizational Design: The new General Counsel for a multi-billion dollar energy and specialty refining company asked RGP to redesign its legal department structure from the ground up. A series of acquisitions, coupled with a more complex business environment, increased the department&#146;s work flows. Our consultants conducted extensive stakeholder interviews and an analysis of department operations to develop an organizational model stressing business continuity, best practices in organizational design, areas of process and resourcing improvement, and organizational development. RGP&#146;s solution resulted in a leaner legal team that leverages effective and efficient legal services providers, while implementing in-house efficiencies and automation. 

&#160;

Sample Engagement &#151; Development and Implementation of Knowledge Management Tool: Our client, a multi-million dollar asset management firm, lacked an efficient tool for handling information related to its investment/private equity funds. As a result, in-house attorneys often started deals without the benefit of knowledge gleaned from previously negotiated agreements. Documents were difficult to locate, important deal information was lost, and providing information to regulators and third parties was often time consuming and inefficient. 

RGP designed a knowledge management tool to increase efficiencies in the client&#146;s deal flow and archiving process. RGP crafted a simple searchable database tool that provided an effective way to access, retrieve, archive and leverage important deal information. RGP also conducted a gap analysis on missing deal documents and developed training to ensure attorney buy-in and acceptance of the management tool.

Sample Engagement &#151; Vendor Risk Management Software Selection and Monitoring: A major publicly-traded financial services company wanted to effectively and proactively identify and manage previously unaddressed significant vendor risks. Working collaboratively, a cross-functional team of client personnel and RGP consultants developed a comprehensive vendor performance monitoring function. The team identified three key project work streams: 1) establishment of solutions to support and maintain the client&#146;s third party vendor management processes, systems, standards and metrics tracking; 2) development of user guides and materials and training on the selected software tool to support the function; 3) development and support of the day to day processes to ensure compliance with regulations, guidelines and firm requirements.

However, during checkout, customers realized that shipping and handling fees associated with the purchase were too high, resulting in an 80% cart abandonment rate and a significant loss in sales. In the current e-commerce environment, consumers have been trained to expect free shipping, free shipping over a specific order value or flat rate shipping. 

The client engaged RGP to identify short term solutions to reduce shipping and handling charges prior to the next selling season, as well as longer term ideas for future releases. After conducting a four week assessment of the recent sales cycle and associated data, RGP consultants provided specific recommendations to reduce shipping and handling costs, reduce the order cycle and transit time and reduce packaging waste. In addition, observations were made to improve the consumer experience, with the goal of increasing sales. 

Sample Engagement &#151; Procure-to-Pay Assessment: A large multinational consumer electronic company needed assistance in conducting an assessment of its Procure-to-Pay process to review performance and to identify recommendations to fill gaps. The client had two primary goals: 1) to assess the current state; and 2) to provide insights on the future state, with comparison to leading practices and a high-level implementation roadmap. RGP, acting in project management and business analyst roles, was tasked with: 

&#160;

Sample Engagement &#151; Documentation and Enhancement of Internal Controls in Preparation for IPO or Sale: A highly profitable and fast growing maker of electronic equipment had both inadequate IT general controls and poor documentation of its processes. As a result, highly detailed and expensive substantive audit procedures needed to be performed in order to prepare financial statements for a contemplated IPO or sale of the company. Serving as project manager and change management lead, RGP consultants performed an assessment of IT general controls, identified critical risk areas and prepared detailed action plans to remediate or implement controls. 

Sample Engagement &#151; Implementation of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;) Framework: A Fortune 500 software developer engaged us to serve as the lead in applying the COSO framework of controls in a highly complex business environment.

Sample Engagement &#151; Documentation and Enhancement of Internal Controls: A rapidly growing maker of automation software needed an assessment of current state business processes and internal controls at its U.S. and India operations for Sarbanes and general business purposes. Our consultants documented current state of internal controls, made recommendations for enhanced future state of controls and presented our findings to executive management. The assessments identified a significant number of high risk items that the client was unaware of, with actionable recommendations for improvement. 

Sample Engagement &#151; Internal Audit Co-Sourcing and Internal Control Framework: A global insurance provider engaged RGP to provide co-sourced internal audit functions as well as to implement its Internal Control Framework (&#147;ICF&#148;).

Sample Engagement &#151; Banking Compliance Support: Our client, a Fortune 500 financial services company, wanted to develop and implement a more formal approach to the assessment of the company&#146;s regulatory risk profile. Previously, decisions on assessment of regulatory risk were more of an intuitive exercise than a formalized methodology. To help the client evolve its process, RGP was responsible for the entire project, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Identifying risk topics for each product type (real estate loans, consumer loans, credit cards, deposits, trusts and others) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Determining gaps in regulation coverage &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Creating risk statements for each product &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Defining the inherent and control risk definitions &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Building and scoring the templates to be used to document the efforts The final deliverable allowed bank management to better allocate limited resources to maximize coverage of critical compliance issues using the quantifiable basis of risk assessment. Ultimately, RGP consultants deployed the methodology through other facets of the company&#146;s operation, including property/casualty and life insurance and investment management. 

Sample Engagement &#151; Audit IT Security Controls: The CIO of a global healthcare company headquartered in Europe planned a series of global IT audits.

We generally provide our professional services to clients at a local level, with the oversight of our regional managing directors and consultation of our corporate management team. The managing director, client service director(s) and recruiting director(s) in each office are responsible for initiating client relationships, identifying consultants specifically skilled to perform client projects, ensuring client and consultant satisfaction throughout engagements and maintaining client relationships post-engagement. Throughout this process, the corporate management team and regional managing directors are available to consult with the managing director with respect to client services. 

Our offices operate in an entrepreneurial manner. The managing directors of our offices are given significant autonomy in the daily operations of their respective offices, and are responsible for overall guidance and supervision, budgeting and forecasting, sales and marketing, pricing and hiring within their office. We believe that a substantial portion of the buying decisions made by our clients are made on a local or regional basis and that our offices most often compete with other professional services providers on a local or regional basis. Because our managing directors are in the best position to understand the local and regional outsourced professional services market and because clients often prefer local relationships, we believe that a decentralized operating environment maximizes operating performance and contributes to employee and client satisfaction. 

We believe that our ability to deliver professional services successfully to clients is dependent on our managing directors working together as a collegial and collaborative team, at times working jointly on client projects. To build a sense of team effort and increase camaraderie among our managing directors, we have an incentive program for our office management that awards annual bonuses based on both the performance of the Company and the performance of the individual. We also share across the Company the best and most effective practices of our highest achieving offices and use this as an introductory tool with new managing directors. New managing directors also spend time with another practice, partnering with experienced managing directors and other senior management personnel. This allows the veteran managing directors to share their success stories, foster the culture of the Company with new managing directors and review specific client and consultant development programs. We believe these team-based practices enable us to better serve clients who prefer a centrally organized service approach. 

From our corporate headquarters in Irvine, California, we provide centralized administrative, marketing, finance, HR, IT, legal and real estate support. Our financial reporting is also centralized in our corporate service center. This center handles invoicing, accounts payable and collections, and administers HR services including employee compensation and benefits administration for North American offices. We also have a business support operations center in our Utrecht, Netherlands office to provide centralized finance, HR, IT, payroll and legal support to our European offices. In addition, in North America, we have a corporate networked IT platform with centralized financial reporting capabilities and a front office client management system. These centralized functions minimize the administrative burdens on our office management and allow them to spend more time focused on client and consultant development. 

Business Development 

Our business development initiatives are composed of: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; local initiatives focused on existing clients and target companies &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; national and international targeting efforts focused on multinational companies &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; brand marketing activities &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; national and local advertising and direct mail programs Our business development efforts are driven by the networking and sales efforts of our management. In addition, the local office managing directors are assisted by management professionals focused on business development efforts on a national basis based on firm-wide and industry-focused initiatives. These business development professionals, teamed with the managing director and client service teams, are responsible for initiating and fostering relationships with the senior management and decision makers of our targeted client companies. These local efforts are supplemented with national marketing assistance. We believe that these efforts have been effective in generating incremental revenues from existing clients and developing new client relationships. 

Our brand marketing initiatives help develop RGP&#146;s image in the markets we serve. Our brand is reinforced by our professionally designed website, television, print, radio and online advertising, direct marketing, seminars, initiative-oriented brochures, social media and public relations efforts. We believe that our branding initiatives, coupled with our high-quality client service, help to differentiate us from our competitors and to establish RGP as a credible and reputable global professional services firm.

&#160; &#149; &#160; the in-house or former in-house resources of our clients We compete for clients on the basis of the quality of professionals, the timely availability of professionals with requisite skills, the scope and price of services, and the geographic reach of services. We believe that our attractive value proposition, consisting of our highly qualified consultants, relationship-oriented approach and professional culture, enables us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Although we believe we compete favorably with our competitors, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do.
