 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS 

GrowLife, Inc. (&#8220;GrowLife&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is headquartered in Seattle, Washington. We were founded in 2012 with the Closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger with SGT Merger Corporation. We have authorized common stock of 3,000,000,000 shares at $0.0001 par value and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 were authorized by the shareholders. In addition, on October 21, 2015 we issued 150,000 Series B Preferred Stock at a stated value equal to $10.00 per share that is convertible into our common stock. On October 21, 2015, we also issued 51 shares of Series C Preferred Stock at $0.0001 par value per share. 

&#160;

Our goal of becoming the nation&#8217;s largest cultivation facility service provider for the production of organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines has not changed. Our mission is to best serve more cultivators in the design, build-out, expansion and maintenance of their facilities with products of high quality, exceptional value and competitive price. Through knowledgeable representatives, regional centers and its e-commerce website, GrowLife provides essential and hard-to-find goods including media (i.e., farming soil), industry-leading hydroponics equipment, organic plant nutrients, and thousands more products to specialty grow operations across the United States. 

We primarily sell through our wholly owned subsidiary, GrowLife Hydroponics, Inc. In addition to the promotion and sales of GrowLife owned brands, GrowLife companies distribute and sell over 3,000 products through its e-commerce distribution channel, Greners.com, and through our regional retail storefronts. GrowLife and its business units are organized and directed to operate strictly in accordance with all applicable state and federal laws. 

Resumed Trading of our Common Stock 

On February 18, 2016, our common stock resumed unsolicited quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board after receiving clearance from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) on our Form 15c2-11. We are currently taking the appropriate steps to uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and resume priced quotations with market makers as soon as it is able. 

&#160;

Overcoming Company Challenges 

We grew through a series of acquisitions in 2012 and 2013 leading to seven retail stores. In 2013 we expected to grow through the following three key initiatives (i) expanding to 30 retail stores at an expected average annual revenue of $1.25 million with 12 stores in 2014 resulting in sales of $15 million; (ii) educating the investment community of the demand for indoor growing equipment from the cannabis industry; and (iii) engaging a joint venture investor willing to provide financial resources for acquisitions and strategic investments. The three initiatives were expected to help position us as the leading supplier and participating investor to the emerging cannabis industry and were therefore announced and allocated resources with those goals in mind. 

The retail expansion plan, starting in July 2013, was expected to maintain the pre-acquisition revenue pace of GrowLife Hydroponics&#8217; earlier purchase of Rocky Mountain Hydroponics, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (&#8220;RMC&#8221;), and Evergreen Garden Center, LLC, a Maine limited liability company (&#8220;EGC&#8221;), and generate sales of $5.5 million in 2013. For several reasons, GrowLife Hydroponics achieved 2013 revenue of $4.8 million. In addition, GrowLife Hydroponics opened two more stores in Plaistow, New Hampshire and Peabody, Massachusetts. This seven store expansion across five states exposed three issues with the retail expansion plan: (i) the cost of inventory, integration and ramp up in offsetting revenue was under-estimated; (ii) the laws, policies and resulting customer purchase process across the five states varied greatly and lowered the expected economies of scale benefit; and (iii) the increasing competitive hydroponic supplier market, stemming from manufacturers selling directly to cultivators, lowered expected operating margins. The lack of financial resources to offset the operating losses from the retail expansion initiative necessitated a change of our plans. 

An education initiative was formed where GrowLife engaged Grass Roots Research and Distribution, Inc., a market research and marketing firm, to study our 2013 plan, the emerging growth of the cannabis industry and estimate the possible financial impact to GrowLife and its valuation. Sets of reports were published and supported with GrowLife press releases to educate the new industry and generate greater awareness of GrowLife. While this initiative proved successful in 2013, we ceased to engage Grass Roots in 2014, after we changed our business strategy. 

The third investor initiative was formed in November 2013, through the Organic Growth International, LLC (&#8220;OGI&#8221;), a joint venture, between GrowLife and CANX USA LLC (&#8220;CANX&#8221;). CANX would provide the financial resources for OGI to facilitate acquisitions and strategic investments. GrowLife issued warrants for 240 million GrowLife shares to CANX and CANX would provide up to $40 million in mutually agreed upon investments, $1 million in a convertible note and a $1.3 million commitment towards the GrowLife Infrastructure Funding &#38; Technology (&#8220;GIFT&#8221;) program. GrowLife received the $1 million as a convertible note in December 2013, received the $1.3 million commitment but not executed and by January 2014 OGI had Letters of Intent with four investment and acquisition transactions valued at $96 million. Before the deals could close, the SEC put a trading halt on our stock on April 10, 2014, which resulted in the withdrawal of all transactions. The business disruption from the trading halt and the resulting class action and derivative lawsuits ceased further investments with the OGI joint venture. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Starting in June 2014 we focused on cost reductions with minimal revenue loss as our focus. The primary reduction in operating costs came from (i) streamlining non-profitable personnel, lowering expenses by replacing the Woodland Hills, California headquarters with that of Seattle, Washington that serves more people at a lower cost; (ii) closing the unprofitable Peabody, Massachusetts, Woodland Hills, California and Plaistow, New Hampshire stores and Boulder, Colorado; (iii) relocating the Greners.com e-commerce operation from Santa Rosa, California to the Vail, Colorado store until a new Denver facility is set up; (iv) reducing full-time employees from 46 to 8 as of December 31, 2015; and (v) closing the Phototron subsidiary in California. While transition costs were paid out, the repurposing of company resources is expected to reduce our operating expenses and allows for greater market reach and efficiencies. 

However, the challenges of operating a public company under the strains grey market trading and lawsuits, as well as limited access to investment capital kept the company lean. We also chose to convert inventory into cash. This reduced our inventory level from approximately $1.8 million during 2014 to $400,000 as of December 31, 2015 and lowered our gross margins to 14 . 8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This conscientious decision was made to help us transition through this period. Also, we reduced our general and administrative expenses from approximately $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

We remain focused on hiring the best people to expand our direct sales personnel. These personnel are knowledgeable in using the most progressive growing technologies that fit our customer&#8217;s needs. Whether they are small-scale local cultivation facilities or large-scale regional cultivators, our customer service team recommends smart medium, cost-effective lighting and ventilation, and the right nutrients that are best suited for the crop objective. Our knowledge layer is strategic for the evolution of the indoor growing industry. Unlike an outdoor superstore, GrowLife serves the specialty cultivation business as indoor crops are designed to deliver multiple grow cycles with greater quality and yield not available in outdoor agriculture. Technologies will be available to provide our customers with a way to further tune their ordering process and crop development using their own experience. 

Customer Insights 

GrowLife has the unique advantage of working with many cultivators of all sizes across most states that have differing laws and policies for indoor growing. This advantage has given us insights into our customers changing needs. During the last twelve months we have seen a dramatic change in many key areas that required us to adjust our strategies even faster than expected. For example, we expected the retail business to be eclipsed by e-commerce and direct sales combined, however, we now see that each one is surpassing retail sales. While localized, on-hand inventory has a benefit to most cultivators; price, by far, is driving most purchasing decisions. Simply putting up an e-commerce website without a presence in the retail and direct channels is not enough to engage the leading suppliers. Therefore, it remains critical that GrowLife continues to execute its multi-channel strategy, albeit at a different composition. 

The driving force behind the customer&#8217;s pricing pressure is not that cultivators are greedily seeking to increase their profits or capitalize on the expected commoditization of growing equipment and supplies. Instead, cultivators are quickly adjusting their business models to make a profit. Also, the innovation of optimized indoor growing equipment and supplies is keeping them from becoming a commodity. Indoor cultivation business models, whether they are organic fruits and vegetables or cannabis, have been based on supplying a premium priced crop to serve increasing demand. The dynamics where most of the volume produced is based on supplying a premium crop that is saturating premium demand means that the premium price will drop. Almost two years ago, a 1/8 of an ounce of premium cannabis was selling for about $70. Today, the same crop in the same market sells for less than half that price and the surplus that is being sold in the non-premium market is selling for about 25% of the price; in some cases, for less.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our observations from customers reveal that the more sophisticated cultivators have made the business model adjust and most new cultivators have not distinguished the new price elasticity of demand. In the chart below, the demand line (green) for high grade intersected supply line (red) to define an equilibrium price point. As new cultivators entered the market they assumed that demand would increase for high grade and create what we call a phantom demand (gray) so that the increase in overall supply would lead to an increase in price (Pp). However, many reports support that the increase in supply stayed aligned with the original demand (green) and has led to the lower new price (Pn). The overall increase in demand that is commonly mentioned is not for high grade but for commercial grade, which is used for edibles and a less sophisticated palate.

The cost of indoor growing, which included equipment, supplies, water, electricity, housing and skilled labor, requires capital. The risk and limited supply of the capital demanded a higher cost for the cannabis market than that of common fruits and vegetables. The cultivator has found themselves needing to pay more from their crop than expected and needing to sell at close to last year&#8217;s prices to achieve a reasonable return. Many customers have indicated that they were prepared to accept a 20-30% drop in selling price, but a 50% drop has created business challenges. 

Another unanticipated issue is the separation of dispensaries (cannabis retailers) from the cultivation process. Cultivators now must market their crop to dispensaries that make higher margins, but have many supplier choices. This is leading to the segmentation between boutique premiums versus large commercial grade operations. Thus, the business model adjustments those cultivators are going through. Premium growers seek to scale in order to cover expenses and commercial grade cultivators must decrease prices or introduce quality production to win over dispensaries. 

We are working with cultivators of all sizes, across all states at different stages; all of which are seeking to lower operating costs. Since resources such as water and electricity are limited and expensive, we help cultivators get more with less. Vertical farming has become a real and practical cultivation process for volume where a 20-by-30 square foot room that normally houses about 150 plants can now grow over 550 plants, almost three times more. Specially designed vertical lighting with 360-degree coverage and using 35% less power now delivers the necessary light with less heat, thus lowering the HVAC power demand. Finally, specially designed pots automatically control both watering and drainage efficiently. We have both the expertise and supplier relationships to help cultivators scale up with configurations like these. 

Market Size and Growth 

As the states across the country approve medicinal cannabis usage, with different THC and CBD compositions, cultivators purchase equipment and supplies from GrowLife and similar indoor growing supply companies.Therefore, as the cannabis market grows so does the revenue growth opportunity for us. Researchers from The ArcView Group , a cannabis industry investment and research firm based in Oakland, California, found that the U.S. market for cannabis grew 74 percent in 2014 to $2.7 billion, up from $1.5 billion in 2013. Today, 23 states plus Washington, DC have legalized cannabis for medical use and four states plus Washington, DC have passed recreational use into law. 

&#160;

We serve a new, yet sophisticated community of commercial and urban cultivators growing specialty crops including organics, greens and plant-based medicines. Unlike the traditional agricultural industry, these cultivators use innovative indoor growing techniques to produce specialty crops in highly controlled environments. This enables them to produce crops at higher yields without having to compromise quality - regardless of the season or weather and drought conditions. 

Indoor growing techniques have primarily been used to cultivate plant-based medicines. Plant-based medicines often require high-degree of regulation and controls including government compliance, security, and crop consistency, making indoor growing techniques a preferred method. Cultivators of plant-based medicines often make a significant investment to design and build-out their facilities. They look to work with companies such as GrowLife who understand their specific needs, and can help mitigate risks that could jeopardize their crops. 

The ArcView report indicates that plant-based medicines are the fastest-growing market in the U.S., and conservatively predicts the market could be worth more than $10 billion within five years. Several industry pundits including Dr. Sanjay Gupta of CNN believe that plant-based medicines may even displace prescription pain medication by providing patients with a safer, more affordable alternative. 

Indoor growing techniques, however, are not limited to plant-based medicines. Vertical farms producing organic fruits and vegetables are beginning to emerge in the market due to a rising shortage of farmland, and environmental vulnerabilities including drought, other severe weather conditions and insect pests. Indoor growing techniques enables cultivators to grow crops all-year-round in urban areas, and take up less ground while minimizing environmental risks. Indoor growing techniques typically require a more significant upfront investment to design and build-out these facilities, than traditional farmlands. If new innovations lower the costs for indoor growing, and the costs to operate traditional farmlands continue to rise, then indoor growing techniques may be a compelling alternative for the broader agricultural industry.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Strategy 

Our goal is to become the nation&#8217;s largest cultivation facility service provider for the production of organics, herbs and greens and plant-based medicines. We intend to achieve our goal by (i) expanding our nationwide, multi-channel sales network presence, (ii) offering the best terms for the full range of build-out equipment and consumable supplies, and (iii) deliver superior, innovative products exclusively. 

First, we provide distribution through retail, e-commerce and direct sales to have national coverage and serve cultivators of all sizes. Each channel offers varying pricing for differing benefits. Retail sells at list price by offering inventory convenience, e-commerce provides the lowest price without requiring local inventory, and direct sales delivers the best bid price for high-volume purchasers. Additional points of service may be added through existing distribution locations and services. This may be done in several manners such as a value-added reseller program that reaches hundreds of cultivator-centric locations or with collations with other resellers. 

Second, we serve the needs of all size cultivators and each one&#8217;s unique formulation. We provide thousands of varieties of supplies from dozens of vendors and distributors. More importantly is our experience of knowing which products to recommend under each customer&#8217;s circumstance. Growing operations seeking expansion may also qualify for leasing terms by one of our financing partner. 

And third, our experience with hundreds of customers allows us to determine specific product needs and sources to test new designs. Lights, pesticides, nutrients, extraction and growing systems are some examples of products that GrowLife has obtained exclusive access to purchase and distribute. Popular name branded products are seeking to be part of the GrowLife Company in many forms. In exchange, we can market their products in a unique manner over generic products. 

Our company will expand on these strategies until it serves all the indoor cultivators throughout the country. Once a customer is engaged, we will gradually expand their purchasing market share by providing greater economic benefit to the customers who buy more products from GrowLife than from other suppliers. 

Key Market Priorities 

Demand for indoor growing equipment is currently high due to legalization of plant-based medicines, primarily cannabis, which is mainly due to equipment purchases for build-out and repeated consumables. This demand is projected to continue to grow as a result of the supporting state laws in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Continued innovation in more efficient build-out technologies along with larger and consolidated cultivation facilities will further expand market demand for our products and services. 

We expect for the market to continue to segment into urban farmers serving groups of individuals, community cultivators, and large-scale cultivation facilities across the states. Each segment will be optimized to different distribution channels that we currently provide. Our volume purchasing will allow us to obtain the best prices and maximize both our revenues and gross margins. 

The nature of the cannabis industry&#8217;s inefficiencies due to the lack of interstate commerce imposed by the Federal government has segmented the market opportunities by State laws, population and demand. Currently, Colorado laws and population demand make it the most progressive and top market in the industry. We have elected to have a major retail presence in Colorado with our direct sales team and centralized our national e-commerce operations. We are currently reaching most of the legal states using both direct sales and seek to re-introduce GrowLife eco products to other hydroponic retailers. 

Employees 

Starting in 2014 and as of December 31, 2015, we reduced our manpower count from 46 to 8 by leveraging our resources across many areas. All company operations are continually reviewed for growth opportunities and direct sales along with GrowLife eco , a premium line of eco-friendly products, is planned to enable the Company to expand its coverage in a cost-effective manner. 

As of March 30, 2016, we had one full-time employee and one consultant at our Seattle, Washington office. Marco Hegyi, our President, is based in Seattle, Washington. Mark E. Scott, our consulting CFO, is based out of in Seattle, Washington. In addition, we have 7 employees located throughout the United States who operate our e-commerce, direct sales and retail businesses. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.

We remain focused on hiring the best people to expand our direct sales personnel. These personnel are knowledgeable in using the most progressive growing technologies that fit our customer&#8217;s needs.

Key Partners 

Our key customers varying by state and are expected to be more defined as the company moves from its retail walk-in purchasing sales strategy to serving cultivation facilities directly and under predictable purchasing contracts. 

&#160; 

Our key suppliers include distributors such as HydroFarm, Urban Horticultural Supply and Sunlight Supply to product-specific suppliers. All the products purchased and resold are applicable to indoor growing for organics, greens, and plant-based medicines. 

Competition 

Certain large commercial cultivators have found themselves willing to assume their own equipment support by buying large volume purchased directly from certain suppliers and distributors such as Sunlight Supplies, HydroFarm, and UHS. Other key competitors on the retail side consist of local and regional hydroponic resellers of indoor growing equipment. On the e-commerce business, GrowersHouse.com, Hydrobuilder.com, HorticultureSource.com and smaller online resellers using Amazon and eBay e-commerce market systems. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

Our intellectual property consists of brands and their related trademarks and websites, customer lists and affiliations, product know-how and technology, and marketing intangibles. 

Our other intellectual property is primarily in the form of trademarks and domain names. We also hold rights to more than 30 website addresses related to our business including websites that are actively used in our day-to-day business such as www.growlifeinc.com, www.growlifeeco.com , www.stealthgrow.com , and www.greners.com . 

We have a policy of entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees and some of our vendors and customers as necessary. 

Government Regulation 

Currently, there are twenty-three states plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. About a dozen other states are considering legislation to similar effect. There are currently four states that allow recreational use of cannabis. As of the date of this writing, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of state law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of customers of GrowLife to invest in or buy products from GrowLife. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect revenues and profits of the GrowLife companies. 

All this being said, many reports show that the majority of the American public is in favor of making medical cannabis available as a controlled substance to those patients who need it. The need and consumption will then require cultivators to continue to provide safe and compliant crops to consumers. The cultivators will then need to build facilities and use consumable products, which GrowLife provides. 

THE COMPANY&#8217;S COMMON STOCK 

&#160; 

Our common stock trades on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol &#8220;PHOT.&#8221; While the company&#8217;s common stock is currently traded without a market maker, its stock does trade directly between buyers and sellers. The Company is currently taking the appropriate steps to uplist to the OTCQB Exchange and resume priced quotations with market makers as soon as it is able. 

&#160; 

PRIMARY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
