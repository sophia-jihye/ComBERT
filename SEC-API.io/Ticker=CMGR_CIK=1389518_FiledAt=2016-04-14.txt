History 

Nanning Tongji Hospital, Inc. ("NTH" or &#8220;Tongji Hospital&#8221;) was established in Nanning, Guangxi province of the People&#8217;s Republic of China ("PRC") by Nanning Tongji Medical Co. Ltd. and an individual on October 30, 2003. 

NTH is an assigned hospital for medical insurance in both the city of Nanning and the province of Guangxi. NTH specializes in the areas of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health examination, and prevention. 

On December 19, 2006, the officers of NTH established Tongji Healthcare Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the "Company"), and Tongji, Inc., a Colorado corporation ("Tongji"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company was authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock both with a par value of $0.001. 

On December 27, 2006, Tongji acquired 100% of the equity in NTH pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger. The Company issued 15,652,557 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of NTH in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of NTH. Accordingly, NTH became the wholly owned subsidiary of Tongji. 

&#160; 

In March, 2011, Tongji was dissolved pursuant to the laws of Colorado. Unless otherwise provided, references to the &#8220;Company&#8221; shall hereinafter include the Company and NTH.

Corporate Structure 

&#160; 

Our present corporate structure is as follows:

&#160;

Our Business 

We operate Tongji Hospital, a general hospital with 105 licensed beds. Tongji Hospital offers care and treatment in the areas of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, emergency medicine, ophthalmology, medical cosmetology, rehabilitation, dermatology, otolaryngology, traditional Chinese medicine, medical imaging, anesthesia, acupuncture, physical therapy, health examination, prevention, and emergency care. Our emergency room is open 24 hours a day and all of our rooms are air conditioned. 

&#160; 

Tongji Hospital is certified as a provider of Medicare services by the Nanning municipal government and the Guangxi provincial government. Our Medicare agreements with the Nanning municipal government and the Guangxi provincial government require that we adhere to prescribed standards for patient care and treatment. Maintaining the qualifications for acceptance of Medicare patients is very important as revenue from Medicare patients accounted for 41% of total hospital income in 2015. The Medicare accreditation is valid for only one year and must be renewed on an annual basis. 

&#160; 

Because we maintain a facility in excess of 100 beds, we must register with and maintain an operating license from the local Administration of Health. We are subjected to review by the local Administration of Health at least once every three years. If we fail to meet their standards, our license may be revoked. We are also obligated to provide free services or dispatch our physicians or employees in the event of a need for public assistance. Currently, we dedicate a very small percentage of our resources to providing free public services. 

&#160; 

As is common in China, we generate revenues from providing both medical treatment and the sale of drugs and medications. Approximately 2% of the drugs and medications we use in the hospital and sell to our patients in 2015 are purchased from Guangxi Tongji Medicine Co., Ltd., a related company controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, Yunhui Yu, at prevailing market prices pursuant to a supply contract. The rest are from around 28 different suppliers, three of which accounted for more than 50% of our total purchases in 2015. 

We generate revenues from individuals as well as third-party payers, including PRC government programs and insurance providers, under which the hospital is paid based upon several methodologies including established charges, the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from established charges. Revenues are recorded at net amounts due from patients, third-party payers and others for healthcare services provided at the time the service is provided. Revenues from pharmaceutical drug sales are recognized upon the drug being administered to a patient or at the time a prescription is filled for a patient with an executed prescription slip by a registered physician. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Item 1. Business - continued 

&#160; 

Revenues are recorded at net amounts due from patients and government Medicare funds. The Company's accounting system calculates the expected amounts payable by the government Medicare funds. The Company bills for services provided to Medicare patients through a medical card (the US equivalent of an insurance card). The Company normally receives 90% of the billed amount within 90 days with the remaining 10% upon the Company&#8217;s reconciliation by the end of the year. Historically, there have been no significant differences between the amounts the Company bills the government Medicare funds and the amounts collected from the Medicare funds. 

&#160; 

Some differences exist in the Medical System between the U.S. and China. In the United States, most hospitals have contracts with health insurance companies which provide that patients with health insurance will be charged reduced rates for healthcare services. Reduced rates are also charged for Medicare and Medicaid patients. Although the patient is billed for the services provided by the hospital at the higher rate normally charged to patients without insurance, the amount billed is reduced by the charges paid by the insurance carrier and by the difference (sometimes known as the "contractual allowance") between the normal rate for the services and the reduced rate which the hospital estimates it will receive from Medicare, Medicaid and insurance companies. 

&#160; 

For financial reporting purposes, hospitals in the United States record revenues based on established billing rates less adjustments for contractual allowances. Revenues are recorded based on the amounts due from the patients and third-party payers, including federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs) managed care health plans, health insurance companies, and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under third-party payer arrangements are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Third-party payer contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates, or discounted fee-for-service rates. 

Due to the complexities involved in determining the amounts ultimately due under reimbursement arrangements with a large number of third-party payers, which are often subject to interpretation, the reimbursement actually received by U.S. hospitals for health care services is sometimes different from their estimates. 

In contrast, private medical insurance is not generally available to the Chinese population and as a result services and medications provided by our hospital are usually paid for in cash or by the Medicare agencies of the Nanning municipal government and the Guangxi provincial government. Our billing system automatically calculates the reimbursements to which we are entitled based on regulations promulgated by the Medicare agencies. We bill the Medicare agencies directly for services provided to patients covered by the Medicare programs. Since we bill the Medicare agencies directly, our gross revenues are not reduced by contractual allowances. 

We only deal with the Nanning municipal and the Guangxi provincial Medicare agencies, and we are familiar with their regulations pertaining to reimbursements. As a result, there is normally no material difference between the amounts we bill and the amounts we receive for services provided to Medicare patients. 

We are constructing a new hospital building on leased land. The hospital building is being constructed by Guangxi Construction Engineering Corporation Langdong 8th Group (&#8220;Langdong 8th Group&#8221;). Costs capitalized primarily consists of payments for construction costs, acquisition cost, land rights cost, development expenditure, professional fees, and capitalized interest. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had paid approximately $15,300,000 for the construction of the hospital. In addition to what we had paid for the hospital building construction, we estimate the additional costs to complete the project to be $31,000,000. The Company expects to seek to obtain additional funding through the completion of additional equity, debt, or joint venture transactions. The land lease term will start upon completion of the new hospital construction. The new hospital is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 subject to availability of funds. 

&#160; 

The Company will amortize the cost of the hospital building over the life of the land lease of twenty years. 

&#160; 

We plan to acquire other hospitals and companies involved in the healthcare industry in the PRC using cash and shares of our common stock. Substantial capital may be needed for these acquisitions and we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of our common stock, debt financing or other arrangements. We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any additional capital. Additional capital may not be available to us, or if available, on acceptable terms, in which case we would not be able to acquire other hospitals or businesses in the healthcare industry.

Regulations pertaining to our Business 

According to the PRC Regulation of Healthcare Institutions, hospitals shall register with the Administration of Health of the local government to obtain the necessary business license for the provision of hospital services. We received our renewed business license from Nanning City government in November of 2007, and this license is valid until November, 2020. Other existing regulations having material effects on our business include those dealing with physician's licensing, usage of medicine and injection, public security in health and medical advertising. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

The Company had three major customers for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Nanning Social Insurance Center, Guangxi Province Social Insurance Center, and China UMS. Nanning Social Insurance Center accounted for 36% and 33% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Guangxi Province Social Insurance Center accounted for 5% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. China UMS accounted for 15% and 13% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

The Company purchases the majority of its medicine supplies from three suppliers which accounted for more than 50% of our total purchases in 2015. The rest are from around 28 different suppliers. One of the suppliers, Guangxi Tongji Medicine Co. Ltd., a related company that our Chief Executive Officer controls accounted for 2% of our total purchases in 2015. 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with eleven government-owned hospitals and three privately owned hospitals in the city of Nanning. We believe that we will be able to effectively compete with them because we: 

&#183; Provide advanced medical facilities and comfortable environments 

&#183; Maintain the highest level of professional healthcare 

&#183; Offer competitive prices for medical treatment and drugs and medications. 

Marketing 

&#160; 

To increase our visibility we built several &#8220;Tongji Hospital&#8221; signs at locations near our hospital and some busy streets in Nanning city. We also send out our experts and medical team to communities to provide free public services including consultation and medical services to attract customers. Some other marketing activities include media advertising, holiday promotions, telephone services, and reduced fees. 

&#160;

In the future we plan to further strengthen our marketing efforts and improve our brand awareness through advertising on newspapers, magazines and television. We will continue to focus on community medical service by maintaining good relationship with our communities, and providing quality medical service to the neighborhood residents. We will set up our marketing department and team to focus on specific market and patients. We understand that the key to success is to provide quality services. Marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 is approximately $5,000. Budgeted marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 is approximately $11,000 in an effort to improve our brand awareness.
