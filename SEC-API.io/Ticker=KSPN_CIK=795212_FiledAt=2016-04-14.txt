Financial information about industry segments required by this item is included in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

Business Environment

&#160;

Based primarily on statistical information obtained from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment and Nielsen Sound Scan (&#8220;SoundScan&#8221;); physical video and music represent an approximately $9 billion industry nationwide in 2015. Video and music accounted for approximately 65% of the Company&#8217;s net sales in fiscal 2015 versus 71% of sales in fiscal 2014.

&#160;

According to statistics obtained from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment, overall video industry physical retail sales in 2015 were $6.1 billion compared to $6.9 billion in 2014, a decrease of 11%. Industry DVD retail sales decreased 15% in 2015 compared to 2014, while Blu-ray sales decreased 3%.

&#160;

According to statistical information from SoundScan, the total number of music albums sold, including CD and digital albums, decreased 11% to approximately 273 million units in 2015. Excluding digital albums, in fiscal 2015, album sales decreased 13% from fiscal 2014 to approximately 163 million units.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Physical media sales have suffered from the shift of content to digital distribution, streaming and online retailers (e.g., Amazon) that offer entertainment products at discounted prices and collectively have gained a larger share of the market. As a result of such competition, the number of specialty and independent retailers has decreased dramatically due to their reliance on sales of physical product. The Company has diversified its products and taken other measures to position itself competitively within its industry. The Company believes it effectively competes in the following ways:

&#160;

&#9642; Diversified product mix: the company is expanding the range of product offerings in our non-media businesses. As a result, the non media categories contribution to total sales increased to 33% as compared to 25% in Fiscal 2014. &#9642; Customer service: the Company offers personalized customer service in its stores guided by a commitment to approach every customer with gratitude, humility and respect; &#9642; Location and convenience: a strength of the Company is its convenient store locations that are often the exclusive retailer in regional shopping centers offering a full complement of entertainment products; &#9642; Selection and assortment: the Company maintains a high in-stock position in a large assortment of products; &#9642; Marketing: the Company utilizes in-store visual displays, live events and a digital marketing strategy that employs email blasts and social networking. 5 

Seasonality

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s business is seasonal, with its fourth fiscal quarter constituting the Company&#8217;s peak selling period. In fiscal 2015, the fourth quarter accounted for approximately 36% of annual net sales and all of its net income. In anticipation of increased sales activity in the fourth quarter, the Company purchases additional inventory and hires seasonal associates to supplement its core store sales and distribution center staffs. If, for any reason, the Company&#8217;s net sales were below seasonal norms during the fourth quarter, the Company&#8217;s operating results could be adversely affected. Quarterly sales can also be affected by the timing of new product releases, new store openings or closings and the performance of existing stores.

&#160;

Advertising

&#160;

The Company makes use of visual displays including in-store signage and external banners. The Company employs a marketing strategy including email blasts and social networking. Certain vendors from whom the Company purchases merchandise offer advertising allowances, of varying duration and amount, to promote their merchandise.

&#160; 

Suppliers and Purchasing 

&#160;

The Company purchases inventory from approximately 400 suppliers. In fiscal 2015, 52% of purchases were made from ten suppliers including Bio Domes Headgear, Funko, LLC; Buena Vista Home Video, Paramount Video, Sony Music Entertainment, Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Universal Music Group Distribution, Universal Studios Home Entertainment, Warner/ Elektra/Atlantic Corp Group and Warner Home Video. The Company does not have material long-term purchase contracts; rather, it purchases products from its suppliers on an order-by-order basis. Historically, the Company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory sources of supply and management believes that it will continue to have access to adequate sources of supply.

&#160;

Trade Customs and Practices

&#160;

Under current trade practices with large suppliers, retailers of music and video products are generally entitled to return unsold merchandise they have purchased in exchange for other merchandise carried by the suppliers. The largest music suppliers charge a related merchandise return penalty or return handling fee. Most manufacturers and distributors of video products do not charge a return penalty or handling fee. Under current trade practices with large suppliers, retailers of trend, electronics, video games and related products may receive markdown support from suppliers to help clear discontinued or slow turning merchandise. Merchandise return policies and other trade practices have not changed significantly in recent years. The Company generally adapts its purchasing policies to changes in the policies of its largest suppliers.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of January 30, 2016, the Company employed approximately 2,900 people, of whom approximately 1,100 were employed on a full-time basis. Others were employed on a part-time basis. The Company hires seasonal sales and distribution center employees during its fourth quarter peak selling season to ensure continued levels of personalized customer service and in-stock position. Assistant store managers, store managers, district managers and regional managers are eligible to receive incentive compensation based on the sales and/or profitability of stores for which they are responsible. Sales support managers are generally eligible to receive incentive compensation based on achieving Company performance targets. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and management believes that the Company enjoys favorable relations with its employees.
