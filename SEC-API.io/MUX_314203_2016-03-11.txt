 ITEM 1. BUSINES S 

History and Organization 

We are a mining and minerals production and exploration company focused on precious and base metals in Argentina, Mexico and the United States. We were organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on July 24, 1979 under the name Silver State Mining Corporation. On June 21, 1988, we changed our name to U.S. Gold Corporation and on March 16, 2007, we changed our name to US Gold Corporation. On January 24, 2012, we changed our name to McEwen Mining Inc. after the completion of the acquisition of Minera Andes Inc. (&#8220;Minera Andes&#8221;) by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada. 

We own 100% of the El Gallo 1 gold mine in Sinaloa, Mexico and a 49% interest in Minera Santa Cruz S.A. (&#8220;MSC&#8221;), owner and operator of the producing San Jos&#233; mine in Santa Cruz, Argentina, which is controlled by the majority owner of the joint venture, Hochschild Mining plc (&#8220;Hochschild&#8221;). In addition to our operating properties, we also hold interests in exploration stage properties and projects in Argentina, Mexico and the United States, including the Gold Bar (&#8220;Gold Bar&#8221;) and Los Azules (&#8220;Los Azules&#8221;) projects. 

Our objective is to increase the value of our shares through the exploration, advancement , and extraction of gold, silver and other valuable minerals. Other than the San Jos&#233; mine in Argentina, we generally conduct our exploration activities as sole operator, but we may enter into arrangements with other companies through joint venture or similar agreements in an effort to achieve our strategic objectives. We hold our mineral interests and property and operate our business through various subsidiary companies, each of which is owned entirely, directly, or indirectly, by us. 

Our principal executive office is located at 150 King Street West, Suite 2800, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 1J9 and our telephone number is (866) 441-0690. We also maintain offices in San Juan, Argentina; Guamuchil, Mexico; Elko and Reno, Nevada (U.S.) . Our website is www.mcewenmining.com. We make available our periodic reports and news releases and certain of our corporate governance documents, including our Code of Ethics, on our website. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (&#8220;TSX&#8221;), in each case under the symbol &#8220;MUX&#8221;. Exchangeable shares of our subsidiary McEwen Mining&#8212;Minera Andes Acquisition Corp. organized in connection with the acquisition of Minera Andes, are listed on the TSX under the symbol &#8220;MAQ&#8221;. 

In this report, &#8220;McEwen Mining&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221; refer to McEwen Mining Inc. together with our subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted. &#8220;Au&#8221; represents gold; &#8220;Ag&#8221; represents silver; &#8220;oz&#8221; represents troy ounce; &#8220;gpt&#8221; represents grams per metric tonne; &#8220;ft.&#8221; represents feet; &#8220;m&#8221; represents meter; &#8220;km&#8221; represents kilometer; and &#8220;sq.&#8221; represents square, and C$ refers to Canadian dollars.

Products 

The end product at our gold and silver operations is either in the form of dor&#233; or concentrate. Production from the El Gallo 1 mine primarily consists of dor&#233;. Dor&#233; is an alloy consisting primarily of gold and silver but also containing other metals. 

&#160;

Dor&#233; is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold and 99.9% silver. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the dor&#233; bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and silver is credited to our account with the refinery . Ore concentrate, or simply concentrate, is raw ore that has been ground finely to a powdery product from which gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component. Production from the San Jos&#233; mine generally consists of approximately 45% dor&#233; production and 55% of concentrate production. Concentrates from the San Jos&#233; mine are shipped to third &#8209;party smelters and refineries for further processing to produce useful metals. 

During 2015, we reported consolidated production attributable to us of 110,320 gold ounces and 3,315,668 silver ounces, for a total of 154,529 gold equivalent ounces (using a silver to gold ratio of 75:1). Of our consolidated gold and silver production, approximately 57% and 1%, respectively, came from our El Gallo 1 mine in Mexico and 43% and 99%, respectively, came from the San Jos&#233; mine in Argentina 

Gold and silver dor&#233; produced in Mexico is generally sold at the prevailing spot market price. 

Gold and silver dor&#233; produced from the San Jos&#233; mine is sold at the prevailing spot market price based on the London A.M. fix, while concentrates are sold at the prevailing spot market price based on either the London P.M. fix or average of the London A.M. and London P.M fix depending on the sales contract. Concentrates are provisionally priced, whereby the selling price is subject to final adjustments at the end of a period ranging from 30 to 90 days after delivery to the customer. The final price is based on the market price at the relevant quotation point stipulated in the contract. Due to the time elapsed between shipment and the final settlement with the buyer, MSC must estimate the prices at which sales of metals will be settled. At the end of each financial reporting period, previously recorded provisional sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices based on relevant forward market prices until final settlement with the buyer. 

During 2015, total gold and silver sales for the El Gallo 1 mine were $73.0 million and for the San Jos&#233; mine were $186.1 million. However, since we account for the San Jose mine using the equity method of accounting, our share of earnings or losses under the equity method for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a gain of $2.4 million from the San Jos&#233; mine. See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding production and operating results for our properties, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8212;Investments , for additional information regarding the equity method of accounting. 

Like all metal producers, our operations are affected by fluctuations in metal prices. The following table presents the annual high, low and average daily London P.M. fix prices per ounce for gold and silver over the past three years and 2016 to the most recent practical date on the London Bullion Market:

Gold and Silver Processing Methods 

Gold and silver are extracted from mineralized material, by either milling or heap leaching, depending on, among other things, the amount of gold and silver contained in the material, whether the material is naturally oxidized or not oxidized, the accessibility of the mineralized material, the amenability of the material to treatment and related capital and operating costs. The mineralized material is extracted by underground (San Jos&#233; mine) and open pit (El Gallo 1 mine) mining methods. 

&#160;

At the El Gallo 1 mine, mineralized material is processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed material on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to leach the gold and silver. The gold and silver &#8209;bearing solution is then collected and pumped to an Adsorption &#8209;Desorption &#8209;Recovery (&#8220;ADR&#8221;) processing plant consisting of carbon columns, stripping circuits and a precious metal refinery to process gold and silver into dor&#233; bars. Dor&#233; bars are then shipped from the mine to a third party refiner to obtain bullion . 

The processing plant at the San Jos&#233; mine is composed of conventional crushing, grinding and flotation circuits. Approximately half of the silver &#8209;gold flotation concentrate is processed in an intensive cyanide leaching circuit with the dissolved gold and silver recovered by electrowinning of a clarified solution followed by smelting to produce dor&#233;. The dor&#233; is then sent to refiners to produce a purer product. The balance of the flotation concentrate is filtered and shipped to a smelter. Flotation and leached tailings are stored in side &#8209;by &#8209;side engineered, zero discharge facilities. Starting in 2015, we began storing flotation tailings in a newly constructed pond, after the original pond reached the end of its useful life at the end of the year 2014. A Merrill Crowe circuit recovers small amounts of gold and silver from the electro-winning discharge solution. 

Gold and Silver Reserves 

There are no proven and probable reserves within the meaning of SEC Industry Guide 7, at El Gallo 1 mine or any of our other properties, except for the San Jos&#233; mine. The portion of proven and probable gold and silver reserves attributable to McEwen Mining from our 49% equity interest in the San Jos&#233; mine, as of December 31, 2015, are presented in the following table. The reserves as presented are in &#8209;place and include mining dilution and mining losses, but do not include allowances for mill or smelter recoveries.

Competitive Business Conditions 

We compete with many companies in the mining and mineral exploration and production industry, including large, established mining companies with substantial capabilities, personnel, and financial resources. There is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available for claim &#8209;staking, lease, or acquisition in Mexico, Argentina or the United States, and other areas where we may conduct our mining or exploration activities. We may be at a competitive disadvantage in acquiring mineral properties, since we compete with these individuals and companies, many of which have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs than we do. From time to time, specific properties or areas which would otherwise be attractive to us for exploration or acquisition may be unavailable due to their previous acquisition by other companies or our lack of financial resources. 

Competition in the industry is not limited to the acquisition of mineral properties, but also extends to the technical expertise to find, advance, and operate such properties; the labor to operate the properties; and the capital for the purpose of funding such exploration and development. Many competitors not only explore for and mine precious and base metals, but conduct refining and marketing operations on a world &#8209;wide basis. Such competition may result in not only our company being unable to acquire desired properties, but to recruit or retain qualified employees or to acquire the capital necessary to fund our operation and advance our properties. Our inability to compete with other companies for these resources would have a material adverse effect on our results of operation, financial condition and cash flows. 

&#160; 

General Government Regulations 

&#160;

We believe that all of our properties are operated in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations. A summary of applicable laws and regulations is set forth below. 

Mexico 

Mining in Mexico is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances governing mineral rights, operations and environmental protection. 

Mineral Concession Rights. Exploration and exploitation of minerals in Mexico may be carried out through Mexican companies incorporated under Mexican law by means of obtaining mining concessions. Mining concessions are granted by the Mexican government for a period of fifty years from the date of their recording in the Public Registry of Mining and are renewable for a further period of fifty years upon application within five years prior to the expiration of such concession in accordance with the Mining Law and its regulations. 

Mining concessions are subject to annual work requirements and payment of annual surface taxes which are assessed and levied on a semi &#8209;annual basis. Such concessions may be transferred or assigned by their holders, but such transfers or assignments must be registered with the Public Registry of Mining in order to be valid against third parties. 

The holder of a concession must pay semi &#8209;annual duties in January and July of each year on a per hectare basis and in accordance with the amounts provided by the Federal Fees Law. 

During the month of May of each year, the concessionaire must file with the General Bureau of Mines, the work assessment reports made on each concession or group of concessions for the preceding calendar year. The regulations of the Mining Law provide tables containing the minimum investment amounts that must be made on a concession. This amount is updated annually in accordance with the changes in the Consumer Price Index. 

Surface Rights. In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concession, in addition to private owners, ejidos (communal owners of land recognized by the Agrarian Law in Mexico) and recognized agrarian communities control surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity (provided that all formalities and procedures in the Agrarian Law are completed). While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos and recognized agrarian communities that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiations in order to comply with such provisions. 

Water Rights. Water rights are managed by the Comisi&#243;n Nacional del A g ua (&#8220;CONAGUA&#8221;). According to the Mexican water rights legislation, industrial users such as mining companies must pay for the right to use as well as consumption &#160; of national waters regardless of how their rights were obtained, with the rates being determined by the availability of water and the method of extraction. We are not required to obtain water rights. According to CONAGUA, the El Gallo Complex is located in the Sinaloa River Aquifer and is termed Zona de Libre Alumbramiento , meaning a free zone because of excess capacity. As of the filing of this report , water usage costs approximately $ 1 . 1 0 &#160; per cubic meter consumed. 

Mining Royalties. In October 2013, the Mexican lower house passed a bill levying a tax &#8209;deductible mining royalty of 7.5% on earnings before the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, along with an additional 0.5% surcharge on precious metals revenue for mining companies. The effective date of the law was January 1, 2014. Although there are a number of uncertainties surrounding the scope, calculation and enforcement of the royalty, based on the Company&#8217;s current interpretation of the bil l, the royalty or surcharge has been estimated in $0.4 million for 2015 and $0.2 million for 2014; therefore, an accrual of $0.6 million has been recorded by the Company as of December 31, 2015 . 

Further, the Company filed an Amparo , a legal recourse seeking remedy for the protection of constitutional rights . In November 2014, the Company received an unfavourable decision from the District Court in respect of this Amparo. The Company appealed the decision by submitting a Revision Recourse ( Recurso de Revisi&#243;n ) to the Supreme Court of the Nation ( Suprema Corte de la Naci &#243; n ). On October 23, 2015 the Company was notified that the appeal had been accepted by the Supreme Court of the Nation. This legal proceeding is still ongoing as of the filing of this report. 

&#160;

Environmental Law. The Environmental Law in Mexico, called the &#8220;General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection to the Environment&#8221; (&#8220;General Law&#8221;), provides for general environmental policies, with specific requirements for certain activities such as exploration set forth in regulations called &#8220;Mexican official norms&#8221;. Responsibility for enforcement of the General Law, the regulations and the Mexican official norms is with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, which regulate all environmental matters with the assistance of Procuradur&#237;a Federal de Protecci&#243;n al Ambiente (&#8220;PROFEPA&#8221;). 

The primary laws and regulations used by the State of Sinaloa where our El Gallo property is located which govern environmental protection for mining and exploration are: the General Law, Forestry Law, Residues Law, as well as their specific regulations on air, water and residues, and the Mexican official norms (&#8220;NOM &#8209;120&#8221;). In order to comply with the environmental regulations, a concessionaire must obtain a series of permits during the exploitation and exploration stage. The time required to obtain the required permits is dependent on a number of factors including the type of vegetation and trees impacted by proposed activities. 

Mining Permits. The Secretariat of Environmental and Natural Resources, the Mexican Government environmental authority (&#8220;SEMARNAT&#8221;), is responsible for issuing environmental permits associated with mining. Three main permits required before construction can begin are: Environmental Impact Statement (known in Mexico as Manifesto Impacto Ambiental ) (&#8220;MIA&#8221;), Land Use Change (known in Mexico as Estudio Justificativo Para Cambio Uso Sueldo ) (&#8220;ETJ&#8221;), and Risk Analysis (known in Mexico as Analisis de Riesgo ) (&#8220;RA&#8221;). A construction permit is required from the local municipality and an archaeological release letter is required from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (&#8220;INAH&#8221;). An explosives permit is required from the ministry of defense before construction can begin. The MIA is required to be prepared by a third &#8209;party contractor and submitted to SEMARNAT and must include a detailed analysis of climate, air quality, water, soil, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio &#8209;economic impacts. The RA study (which is included with the MIA and submitted as one complete document) identifies potential environmental releases of hazardous substances and evaluates the risks in order to establish methods to prevent, respond to, and control environmental emergencies. The ETJ requires that an evaluation be made of the existing conditions of the land, including a plant and wildlife study, an evaluation of the current and proposed use of the land, impacts to naturally occurring resources, and an evaluation of reclamation/re &#8209;vegetation plans. 

Argentina 

Mining in Argentina is subject to numerous federal, provincial and local laws, regulations and ordinances governing mineral rights, operations and environmental protection. 

Mineral Concession Rights. Under Argentine Law, mining concessions are real property, which can be transferred freely and can also be pledged. Concessions are granted by provincial governments for unlimited periods of time, subject to the following conditions: 

(a) 

the payment twice a year of a mining fee or can&#243;n ranging between 320 to 3,200 Argentine pesos per mining claim, or pertenencia , depending on the type of mining claim; and 

(b) 

the filing of a minimum investment plan and compliance with a minimum investment in the concession equal to 300 times the relevant can&#243;n over a five year period. 

Failure to comply with these conditions may result in the termination of the concession. 

Surface Rights. A mining concession alone is not sufficient to permit mining operations. An agreement for access and occupation of the surface land is also required from the surface owner and occupier before mining may commence. Surface rights in Argentina are not automatically granted with title to either a mining lease or a concession and must be negotiated with the landowner. 

Water Rights. Water rights are granted for the land or industry they have been applied for. Water rights cannot be separately seized or expropriated from the land or mining concession for which the use of water has been granted as long as the use for the mining concession is required and the obligations by the title holder are complied with. 

&#160;

Mining Royalties. As legal owners of the mineral resources, provinces are entitled to request royalties from mine operators. Regulations vary from province to province. Under a Mining Tax Stability Agreement between the Province of Santa Cruz, where the San Jos&#233; mine is located, and MSC, the mining royalty was fixed at 1.85% of the mine &#8209;site value per year when the final product is dor&#233; and 2.55% when the final products are concentrates or precipitates. Starting in November 2012, MSC increased its royalty payments to the Province to the legal maximum of 3% for all products. Royalties are paid monthly. 

Reserve Tax Law. In June 2013, the Province of Santa Cruz passed amendments to the Provincial Tax Code and Provincial Tax Law, which imposed a new tax on mining reserves in the Province. The law came into effect on July 5, 2013. The tax amounted to 1% of the value of mine reserves reported in feasibility studies and financial statements inclusive of variations resulting from ongoing operations. Regulations require that the tax be calculated on &#8220;measured&#8221; reserves, and MSC has interpreted this to mean &#8220;proven&#8221; reserves. The Province has not disputed this interpretation but has not provided further clarification on the definition of &#8220;measured&#8221; reserves, and the outcome is not clear at the time. MSC has filed a legal claim disputing the legality of the new tax and has paid the initial installments under protest. 

Further, the Reserve Tax Law was recently voided by the new elected Congress of &#160; Santa Cruz through law 3,462, which was published in the official gazette on December 30, 2015. This law was enforced by the newly elected executive branch through decree 0144/15, and although not specified , it i s applied prospectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, MSC negotiated an agreement with the government of Santa Cruz by which the government resigns to claim any unpaid balance from the aforementioned tax, prior to 2015, whereas MSC resigns to claim the restitution of the amount of the 2013 tax already paid. However, despite an agreement being reached, this document needs the approval of the Supreme Court of Santa Cruz to be valid. As of the filing of this report, this approval had not been received. 

Environmental Law. The Environmental Protection Section of the National Mining Code of Argentina, enacted in 1995, requires that each Provincial government monitor and enforce the laws pertaining to prescribed development and protection of the environment. The Argentine Constitution establishes that the Federal Government is required to set the minimum standards. In 2002, the National Congress established such minimum standards for the sustainable management and protection of the environment and biodiversity, which are applicable throughout Argentina. Provinces are entitled to strengthen those standards. Further, the Argentine Constitution, as amended in 1994, allows any individual who believes a third party may be damaging the environment to initiate an action against such party. Existing and proposed legislation at both the federal and state levels in Argentina governing the protection of glaciers and the management of natural resources, including mining activity, in the vicinity of glaciers, may impact the Company&#8217;s ability to develop its projects. 

Mining Permits. Prior to conducting mining operations, companies must submit an Environmental Impact Report (&#8220;EIR&#8221;) to the provincial government. The EIR must describe the proposed operation and the methods that will be used to prevent undue environmental damage and must be updated biennially. Mine operators are liable for environmental damage and violators of environmental standards may be required to shut down mining operations. An EIR must be submitted every two years in accordance with Argentine Law. 

United States 

Mining in the United States is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws. Three types of laws are of particular importance to our U.S. mineral properties: those affecting land ownership and mining rights; those regulating mining operations; and those dealing with the environment. 

Land Ownership and Mining Rights. Our Nevada properties are primarily located on lands owned by the United States (Federal Lands) and are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872 (&#8220;General Mining Law&#8221;) as amended. The General Mining Law allows the location of mining claims on certain Federal Lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and proper compliance with claim location requirements. A valid mining claim provides the holder with the right to conduct mining operations for the removal of minerals, subject to compliance with the General Mining Law and state law governing the staking and registration of mining claims, as well as compliance with various federal, state and local operating and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances. As the owner or lessee of the unpatented mining claims, we have the right to conduct mining operations on the lands subject to the prior procurement of required operating permits and approvals, compliance with the terms and conditions of any applicable mining lease, and compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations and ordinances. 

&#160;

Mining Operations. The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines are governed by federal, state and local laws. Our Nevada properties are primarily administered by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, which we refer to as the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;). In general, the federal laws that govern mining claim location and maintenance and mining operations on Federal Lands are administered by the BLM. Additional federal laws, such as those governing the purchase, transport or storage of explosives, and those governing mine safety and health, also apply. 

The State of Nevada likewise requires various permits and approvals before mining operations can begin, although the state and federal regulatory agencies usually cooperate to minimize duplication of permitting efforts. Among other things, a detailed reclamation plan must be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until reclamation is completed. The Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (&#8220;NDEP&#8221;) is the state agency that administers the reclamation permits, mine permits and related closure plans on our Nevada properties. Local jurisdictions (such as county governments) may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals). 

Environmental Law. The development, operation, closure, and reclamation of mining projects in the United States requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits from regulatory agencies, and to file various reports and keep records of our operations. Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to our proposed operations may be encountered. We are currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration, reclamation, and environmental requirements. 

Proposed mineral processing at our Gold Bar property will require additional permitting prior to production. Various federal agencies and departments within the State of Nevada and local governments will be cooperating to review applications for any mining development and process facilities at the site. Although not expected, potential external events such as public or cooperating agency opposition could lengthen the schedule for permit acquisition. Because of previously permitted mining activity at the site, we currently have no reason to believe that permits to mine the mineral resources at Gold Bar could not be obtained from local, state and Federal regulatory agencies without unreasonable effort and expense. Production water for the Gold Bar property can be appropriated pursuant to regulations implemented by the State of Nevada. Permits have been acquired to appropriate water necessary for commercial production at the future Gold Bar operation. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Production from our &#160; El Gallo 1 mine is either s old as refined metal on the spot market, or dor&#233; under the terms set out in a dor&#233; purchase agreement between us and th e Bank of Nova Scotia (&#8220;Scotia&#8221;), a Canadian financial institution. Under the terms of that agreement, dated in July 2012, we have the option to sell approximately 90% of the gold and silver contained in dor&#233; bars produced at the El Gallo 1 mine prior to the completion of refining by the third party refiner, which normally takes approximately 15 business days. During the year ended December 31, 201 5 , approximately 42% our sales from El Gallo 1 in Mexico were made through this dor&#233; purchase agreement. We also have an agreement to sell refined metal with a second Canadian financial institution. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, 76% of total sales from the San Jos&#233; mine were made to Republic Metals Corporation and LS Nikko Copper Inc. Republic Metals, a Florida co rporation, is a purchaser of d or&#233; and accounted for 47% of total sales. LS Nikko Copper Inc., a South Korean company, is a purchaser of concentrate, which accounted for 29% of total sales . &#160; MSC has sales agreement with each of these purchasers. 

&#160; 

In the event that our relationship with Scotia or MSC&#8217;s relationship with either Republic Metals or LS Nikko Copper Inc. were interrupted for any reasons, we believe that we or MSC could locate other purchasers for the products, however any interruption would temporarily disrupt the sale of our products and adversely affect our operating results.
