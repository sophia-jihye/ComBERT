 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160;

BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

&#160;

Standard Metals Processing, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Standard Metals&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is an exploration stage company having offices in Gadsden, Alabama and through its subsidiary, a property in Tonopah, Nevada. Our business plan is to purchase equipment and build a facility on our Tonopah property to serve as a permitted custom processing toll milling facility (which includes an analytical lab, pyrometallugircal plant, and hydrometallurgical recovery plant).

&#160;

The Company will perform permitted custom processing toll milling which is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling and refining can include many different processes that are designed specifically for each ore load and to maximize the extraction of precious metals from carbon or concentrates. These toll-processing services also distill, dry, mix, or mill chemicals and bulk materials on a contractual basis and provide a chemical production outsourcing option for industrial companies, which lack the expertise, capacity, or regulatory permits for in-house production.

&#160;

We are required to obtain several permits before we can begin construction of a small scale mineral processing facility to conduct permitted processing toll milling activities and construction of the required additional buildings and well relocation necessary for us to commence operations.

&#160;

Any reference herein to &#8220;Standard Metals,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; is intended to mean Standard Metals Processing, Inc. a Nevada corporation, and all of our subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated.

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 10, 1985 as Princeton Acquisitions, Inc. On December 7, 2009, the Company changed its name to Standard Gold, Inc. Effective March 5, 2013 the Company moved its domicile from Colorado to Nevada and changed its name from Standard Gold, Inc. to Standard Gold Holdings, Inc. We determined that, due to a lack of connection to Colorado, it was in the best interest of the Company to move its domicile to Nevada. Effective December 6, 2013, the Company changed its name to Standard Metals Processing, Inc. to more accurately reflect the business of the Company.

&#160;

On September 29, 2009, we completed a share exchange agreement with Hunter Bates Mining Corporation, a Minnesota corporation (&#8220;Hunter Bates&#8221;) and certain of its shareholders, in which Hunter Bates&#8217; shareholders exchanged all of their capital securities into similar capital securities of ours (the &#8220;Hunter Bates Share Exchange&#8221;) and we adopted the business model of Hunter Bates of mineral exploration and mining. Accordingly, the Hunter Bates Share Exchange represented a change in control and Hunter Bates became our wholly owned subsidiary.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Prior to September 29, 2009, Wits Basin Precious Minerals, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and public reporting company quoted on the Pink Sheets under the symbol &#8220;WITM&#8221; (&#8220;Wits Basin&#8221;) was the majority shareholder of Hunter Bates. Hunter Bates was formed in April 2008 to acquire the prior producing gold mine properties (consisting of land, buildings, equipment, mining claims and permits) located in Central City, Colorado, known as the &#8220;Bates-Hunter Mine.&#8221; On April 29, 2011 we transferred our entire interest and related debt of the Bates-Hunter Mine, to Wits Basin in exchange for the cancellation of a promissory note issued by Hunter Bates payable in favor of Wits Basin in the approximate amount of $2.5 million.

&#160;

On March 15, 2011, we closed a series of transactions, whereby we acquired certain assets of Shea Mining &#38; Milling, LLC (&#8220;Shea Mining&#8221;), which assets include land, buildings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment, water permits, mine tailings, mine dumps and the assignment of a note payable, a lease and a contract agreement with permits. We completed the Shea Exchange Agreement to acquire the Shea assets and develop a permitted custom processing toll milling of precious minerals business.

&#160;

On December 10, 2012, the Company filed two Statements of Correction with the state of Colorado correcting the Second Amended and Restated Articles that had been incorrectly amended in part on March 15, 2011 and in full on March 25, 2011. After the correct Articles of Incorporation were reinstated by the Statements of Correction, the Company filed Articles of Amendment with the state of Colorado on January 4, 2013 to correct and define the Series A Preferred Stock once all board approval and documentation were complete. The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $10,000,000, payable only upon certain liquidity events or upon achievement of a market value of our equity equaling $200,000,000 or more. Additional details regarding the Series A Preferred Stock can be found in our Articles of Amendment, which were filed with the Colorado Secretary of State on January 4, 2013 and in the Form 8-K filed with the Commission on March 13, 2013. The Company is in exchange negotiations with the holder of the Series A Preferred Stock.

&#160;

Series B Preferred Stock 

&#160;

The Company designated 2,500,000 shares of Series B Preferred shares effective November 4, 2013. As of the date of this filing, no shares of our Series B Preferred Stock are issued and outstanding. Shares of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board of Directors, dividends at a rate of 8% per share annually, payable on October 1 of each year. Such dividends shall be cumulative and shall accrue, whether or not earned or declared, from and after the date of issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, whichever is later. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at any time and at the option of the holder, into ten shares of common stock (the &#8220;Stock Conversion Rate&#8221;). The Stock Conversion Rate is subject to certain adjustments for stock-splits, combinations, reclassifications, exchanges, substitutions, reorganizations, mergers and/or consolidations.

&#160;

Upon any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, before any payment of cash or distribution of other property shall be made to the holders of common stock or any other class or series of stock subordinate in liquidation preference to the Company&#8217;s preferred stock, the assets of the Company shall be distributed as follows: first, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to the preferences detailed in the Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock; second, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, pro rata according to the stated value of their shares, out of the assets of the Company legally available for distribution to its shareholders, the greater of: (i) the stated value per share or (ii) the amount such holder of Series B Preferred Stock would be entitled to receive if the shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted into Common Stock at the Stock Conversion Rate.

&#160;

Shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall have no rights to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of shareholders, except as required by law, in which case each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote.

&#160;

Additional details regarding the Series B Preferred Stock can be found in our Articles of Amendment, which are on file with the Nevada Secretary of State.

&#160;

On April, 11, 2016, the Company retired the Series B Preferred Stock. No shares of the Series B Preferred Stock had been issued and cannot be issued at any time.

TOLL MILLING AND THE SHEA EXCHANGE AGREEMENT 

&#160;

On March 15, 2011, in an effort to enter the precious metal toll milling business, we entered into an exchange agreement by and between us, Shea Mining, Afignis, LLC, Leslie Lucas Partners, LLC, Wits Basin and Alfred A. Rapetti (the &#8220;Shea Exchange Agreement&#8221;) whereby we acquired certain assets from Shea Mining, which assets include those located in Tonopah, Nevada (financed through a note payable assigned to us), mine dumps, a property lease and a contract agreement in exchange for 35,000,000 shares of our unregistered shares (an ownership interest of approximately 87% of our then currently outstanding common stock - approximately 56% ownership interest on a fully diluted basis). The Shea Exchange Agreement did not include any operable toll milling equipment, employees or operational processes and therefore has been accounted for as a purchase of a group of assets. Simultaneous with these transactions, pursuant to the Shea Exchange Agreement, Wits Basin exchanged 19,713,544 shares of our common stock it held for 10 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock.

&#160;

Pursuant to the assignment of a note payable, we executed an Assignment and Assumption of Loan Documents and Loan Modification Agreement, by and between us, Shea Mining and NJB Mining, Inc. (the &#8220;Loan Modification Agreement&#8221;), dated March 15, 2011, for those assets located in Tonopah, Nevada (&#8220;Tonopah&#8221;), consisting of land, buildings, mine tailings, a dormant milling facility, abandoned milling equipment and water permits. The land encompasses 1,183 deeded acres, one of the largest private land holdings in Esmeralda County, Nevada. Approximately 334 acres of this land has an estimated 2.2 million tons of tailings known as the Millers Tailings from the historic gold rush of Goldfield and Tonopah, Nevada sitting on it.

&#160;

For additional information on the Shea Exchange Agreement see Note 3 - SHEA MILLING AND MINING ASSETS in the notes to the financial statements.

&#160;

SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; &#160; 

The Company has one wholly owned subsidiary, Tonopah Milling and Metals Group, Inc. (&#8220;TMMG&#8221;), a Nevada corporation. TMMG has two wholly owned subsidiaries, Tonopah Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation and Tonopah Custom Processing, Inc., a Nevada corporation.

&#160;

Water Pollution Control Permit with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection 

&#160;

Through the Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, Tonopah Custom Processing, Inc. (&#8220;TCP&#8221;), it filed a Water Pollution Control Permit (&#8220;WPCP&#8221;) Application with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (&#8220;NDEP&#8221;) Bureau of Mines and Mining Reclamation (&#8220;BMMR&#8221;) for the approval of the permits necessary for a small-scale mineral processing facility planned for the Tonopah Property. The plant will perform laboratory testing, pilot testing, and custom processing of precious metal ores and concentrates from mining industry clients. Processing of ore materials will employ standard mineral processing techniques including gravity concentration, froth flotation and chemical leaching and carbon stripping.

&#160;

The WPCP must be approved prior to commencing the planned construction of our processing plant in Tonopah, Nevada. We are still in the technical review stage of our WPCP. While the Company awaits approval, we are preparing for construction of our processing facility which includes working with contractors that will be building the new 21,875 square foot processing plant, cleaning and preparing the property, and refurbishing a trailer that will act as our construction office.

&#160;

In connection with our WPCP application, NDEP suggested that we take the following actions: (i) retain a Nevada Certified Environmental Manager (&#8220;CEM&#8221;), (ii) perform Meteoric Profile II water testing on ground water directly below the mill as well as surrounding wells located off site, and (iii) determine baseline values of water using the Meteoric Profile II results. NDEP regulations require that the Company delay any new construction planned for &#8220;metal extraction&#8221; until after the permits are in place. We hired Allstate-Nevada Environmental Management, Inc., as our CEM to assist us with obtaining an NDEP WPCP and to help us fulfill all the requirements of NDEP including the Meteoric Profile II analysis, as well as advise on the overall site cleanup and assisting with any other NDEP requirements.

&#160;

Survey 

&#160;

In March 2013, Advanced Surveying &#38; Professional Services, as our Professional Land Surveyor (&#8220;PLS&#8221;), completed surveys and testing of the Tonopah property required for the application of our required permits. After completion of the survey, it was determined the property is 1,183 acres. The scope of work our PLS completed includes: (i) setting a total of 19 permanent monuments at angle points along lines, (ii) setting eight permanent monuments locating US Hwy 95, (iii) recording a professional map indicating longitude and latitude for all corners, and (iv) providing a digital map accessible in AutoCad software.

&#160;

Equipment, Facility and Site Preparation 

&#160;

The Company received leased heavy equipment on August 1, 2013, which was used to begin cleanup of the site to prepare it for the new construction. We ordered a pre-fabricated building on November 4, 2013 and took delivery of the building on March 21, 2014.

&#160;

The Company accepted delivery of additional large heavy equipment on April 1, 2014 and completed the initial grading of specific designated areas on the 40 undisturbed acres of land including clearing all vegetation, removing of all scrap metal and the extra and unnecessary materials and old equipment that have accumulated on the land, and the excavated the building pad for the site of the proposed 21,875 square foot processing plant.

&#160;

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s intention is to become a full service permitted custom toll milling and processing company that facilitates the extraction of precious and strategic minerals from mined material. The Company is in the process of obtaining the permits needed for construction and operation of our permitted custom processing toll milling facility with state of the art equipment capable of processing gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Many junior miners do not have the capital or the ability to permit a processing facility, yet they have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed. It is often cost prohibitive or impractical for these mine operators to send their materials to processing mills owned by the large mining companies, or to other customers with badly needed milling and processing services. &#160;

&#160;

While Nevada has a historic role as a mining center with good proximate geology and ample mined product, very little custom processing toll milling capacity remains in the state. During the last several decades, other processing facilities have been shuttered due to high costs of regulations and the vertical integration of milling within large mining companies leaving junior miners with few options for local milling services. As a result, Standard Metals is in a unique position among processing facilities because it is capable of true permitted custom processing. We have the only ball mill located within a custom toll milling facility within 300 miles allowing us to serve miners in the western United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America.

&#160;

Many junior miners are undercapitalized, have limited access to capital markets and have a large supply of mined material that requires milling be performed. Many large mining companies reserve their milling capacity for their inventory, which does not make providing third party services worthwhile. This provides the Company with an opportunity to provide these potential customers with badly needed milling and processing services.

&#160;

The Company is waiting for the approval of pending applications for the permits required for us to commence construction of our facilities to conduct permitted custom processing toll milling operations.

&#160;

TOLL MILLING 

&#160;

Toll milling is a process whereby mined material is crushed and ground into fine particles to ease the extraction of any precious minerals contained therein, such as minerals in the gold, silver and platinum metal groups. Custom milling and refining that are designed specifically for each ore load can include many different processes to maximize the extraction of precious metals from ore, carbon or concentrates.

&#160;

Procedure 

&#160;

Ore is sent to our facility at the responsibility and cost of the customer. The Company will take a sample of the ore through a specific ore sampling procedure. The Company&#8217;s metallurgist will test the sample on site. To obtain a quantitative determination of the amount of a given substance in a particular sample, the Company can perform wet methods and dry methods. In the wet method, the sample is dissolved in a reagent, like acid, until the purified metal is separated out. In the dry method, the sample is mixed with a flux (a substance such as borax or silica that helps lower the melting temperature) and then heated so that the impurities in the metal fuse with the flux, leaving the purified metal as residue.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If it is determined that the sample is approved for processing, the customer and the Company will then agree upon a value of the metal grade per ton. If there is any disagreement on the value, a third party referee determines the value by testing the sample. The Company charges either a flat fee per ton of the ore processed or a percentage of the precious metals extracted during processing, or a combination of both based on the amount of work that is performed.

&#160;

There are various methods of extraction. The Company determines which method to use based upon the sample sent to the Company. In most situations, a series of tests will be performed on a bulk sample ranging in size from 250 to 1,000 pounds. A metallurgist will determine the best process or processes to use for the extraction based on several factors. These include the composition of the host rock, mineralization of the host rock, whether or not it is an oxide or sulphide ore body, and the particle size of the precious metal. After the metallurgist reviews these characteristics, the Company will run ore on a gold table and assays the concentrates, middlings, and tails. An assay is an investigative procedure for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence or amount of precious metals in ore. If there is too much gold in the middling or tails, the size of the grind is adjusted to increase yield or if there is not enough gold in the middlings or tails the Company grinds the material to a coarser mesh.

&#160;

Some of our miner customers will be able to take their tailings (the material left over after the desired minerals have been extracted) from the material they deposited with the Company and put it back in the exact same mines those particular tailings came from. This eliminates the need for the Company to dispose of those tailings.

&#160;

Concentrate/Leach Circuit 

&#160; 

Concentration is the separation of precious minerals from other materials by utilizing different properties of the minerals to be separated including density, magnetic or electric and physiochemical. The Company will attempt to create a &#8220;concentrate&#8221; of minerals to reduce the size of each ton processed. The Company may also receive concentrates from customers, especially those where transport of tons of raw ore is not feasible.

&#160;

The leaching process uses chemicals to extract the metals from the solid materials (concentrates) and bring them into a solution. Once the metals are in the solution, it is passed through carbon or resin columns where the precious metals are deposited onto the carbon/resin.

&#160;

The metals will then be stripped from the carbon back into a different solution where they are pumped through an electrowinning circuit in a process called carbon stripping. The metals are then deposited onto stainless steel in the electrowinning circuit. After this stage, the metals are either sold or further refined off-site. The solution is recycled and used again to process additional material. 

&#160;

Refocused Business Plan 

&#160;

The Company considered altering its strategy and establishing itself as a specialized mining house that can provide financing in exchange for metals streaming and royalty financing, and also to seek opportunities to acquire current income-producing metal streams and royalty contracts. The Company has undergone some changes in management and a refocus in its business plan. Management is delaying any plans for metals streaming and royalty. The Company is reexamining its next steps for developing a processing facility.

&#160; EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any employees. The Company&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; officers, directors and independent contractors conduct all operations.

&#160;

FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN INDUSTRY SEGMENTS 

&#160;

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our operations included one reportable segment: that of the development of the related services of custom permitted processing toll milling.
