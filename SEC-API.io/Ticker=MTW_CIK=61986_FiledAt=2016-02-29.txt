 Item 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (referred to as the company, MTW, Manitowoc, we, our, and us) was founded in 1902. We are a multi-industry, capital goods manufacturer operating in two principal markets: Cranes and Related Products (Crane) and Foodservice Equipment (Foodservice). Crane is recognized as one of the world&#8217;s leading providers of engineered lifting equipment for the global construction industry, including lattice-boom cranes, tower cranes, mobile telescopic cranes, and boom trucks. Foodservice is one of the world&#8217;s leading innovators and manufacturers of commercial foodservice equipment serving the ice, beverage, refrigeration, food-preparation, holding and cooking needs of restaurants, convenience stores, hotels, healthcare, and institutional applications. We have over a 110-year tradition of providing high-quality, customer-focused products and support services to our markets. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we had net sales of approximately $3.4 billion . 

On February 11, 2016, Manitowoc announced that its Board of Directors approved the separation of the company&#8217;s Crane and Foodservice businesses into two independent, publicly-traded companies. The company currently anticipates effecting the separation through a tax-free spin-off (the &#8220;Spin-Off&#8221;) of the Foodservice business by a distribution of all of the common stock of Manitowoc's subsidiary Manitowoc Foodservice, Inc. ("MFS") and expects the Spin-Off to be completed on March 4, 2016, as previously announced. MFS has filed a Registration Statement on Form 10, registering its shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which Registration Statement was declared effective on February 11, 2016. After the Spin-Off, company operations will consist only of the Crane business and the company will not have any remaining interest in the Foodservices business. However, information related to the Foodservice business is provided in this report because it was part of the company in 2015 and remains part of the company until the Spin-Off occurs. 

Our Crane business is one of the world&#8217;s leading providers of engineered lifting equipment for the global construction industry. We design, manufacture, market, and support one of the comprehensive product lines of mobile telescopic cranes, tower cranes, lattice-boom crawler cranes, and boom trucks. Our Crane products are principally marketed under the Manitowoc, Grove, Potain, National Crane, and Shuttlelift brand names. We serve a wide variety of customers, including dealers, rental companies, contractors, and government entities, across the petrochemical and industrial, commercial, power and utilities, infrastructure, and residential end markets. Additionally, our Manitowoc Crane Care offering leverages Manitowoc Cranes&#8217; installed base of approximately 140,000 cranes to provide aftermarket parts and services to enable our customers to manage their fleets most effectively and improve their return on investment. Due to the ongoing and predictable maintenance needed by cranes, as well as the high cost of crane downtime, Crane Care provides us with an attractive stream of recurring revenue. 

Our Foodservice business is one of the world&#8217;s leading commercial foodservice equipment companies. We design, manufacture and service an integrated portfolio of hot and cold category products, and have a long track record of innovation. We have one of the industry&#8217;s broadest portfolios of products and are recognized by our customers and channel partners for the quality, reliability, and durability of our products. Our capabilities span refrigeration, ice-making, cooking, holding, food-preparation, and beverage-dispensing technologies, which allow us to equip entire commercial kitchens and serve the world&#8217;s growing demand for food prepared away from home. We supply foodservice equipment to commercial and institutional foodservice operators such as full-service restaurants, quick-service restaurant chains, hotels, caterers, supermarkets, convenience stores, business and industry, hospitals, schools and other institutions. Our Foodservice products, services and solutions are marketed through a worldwide network of over three thousand dealers and distributors under well-established and recognized brands, including Cleveland, Convotherm, Dean, Delfield, Fabristeel, Frymaster, Garland, Inducs, Kolpak, Koolaire, Lincoln, Manitowoc Beverage Systems, Manitowoc Ice, Merco, Merrychef, Moorwood Vulcan, Multiplex, RDI Systems, Servend, TRUpour, U.S. Range, and Welbilt. All of our products are supported by KitchenCare, our aftermarket repair and parts service business. Manitowoc Foodservice&#8217;s scale and expertise enable it to serve a global customer base in continually evolving foodservice markets. 

On December 7, 2015, we announced the completion of the sale of Kysor Panel Systems, a manufacturer of wood frame and high-density rail panel systems for walk-in freezers and coolers for the retail and convenience-store markets and part of the Foodservice Business, to an affiliate of D Cubed Group LLC. The sale price for the transaction was approximately $85 million, with cash proceeds received of approximately $78 million. In December 2015, we used the proceeds from the sale to reduce outstanding debt under the existing revolving credit facility. This divestiture does not qualify for discontinued operations; therefore the results of the business are included the operating results from continuing operations. 

During the first quarter of 2014, the company sold its 50% &#32;interest in Manitowoc Dong Yue Heavy Machinery Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Manitowoc Dong Yue&#8221; or the &#8220;joint venture&#8221;), which produces mobile and truck-mounted hydraulic cranes in China, to its 

joint venture partner, Tai&#8217;an Taishan Heavy Industry Investment Co., Ltd., for a nominal amount. Consequently, the joint venture has been classified as discontinued operations in the company&#8217;s financial statements. See Note 5, &#8220;Discontinued Operations,&#8221; for further details concerning this transaction. 

During the first quarter of 2013, the company sold its warewashing equipment business, which operated under the brand name Jackson, to Hoshizaki USA Holdings, Inc. for approximately $39.2 million, including post-closing adjustments. Net proceeds were used to reduce ratably the then-outstanding balances of Term Loans A and B. This business has been classified as discontinued operations in the company's financial statements. 

We are a Wisconsin corporation, and our principal executive offices are located at 2400 South 44th Street, Manitowoc, Wisconsin 54220.

Cranes and Related Products 

Our Crane segment designs, manufactures and distributes a diversified line of crawler-mounted lattice-boom cranes, which we sell under the Manitowoc brand name. Our Crane segment also designs and manufactures a diversified line of top-slewing and self-erecting tower cranes, which we sell under the Potain brand name. We design and manufacture mobile telescopic cranes, which we sell under the Grove and Shuttlelift brand names, and a comprehensive line of hydraulically powered telescopic boom trucks, which we sell under the National Crane brand name. We also provide crane product parts and services, and crane rebuilding, remanufacturing, and training services, which are delivered under the Manitowoc Crane Care brand name. In some cases our products are manufactured for us or distributed for us under strategic alliances. Our crane products are used in a wide variety of applications throughout the world, including energy production/distribution and utilities, petrochemical and industrial projects, infrastructure applications, such as road, bridge and airport construction, plus commercial and residential construction. Many of our customers purchase one or more cranes together with several attachments to permit use of the crane in a broader range of lifting applications and other operations. Our largest crane model combined with available options has a lifting capacity up to 2,500 U.S. tons. 

Lattice-boom cranes. Under the Manitowoc brand name we design, manufacture and distribute lattice-boom crawler cranes. Lattice-boom cranes consist of a lattice-boom, which is a fabricated, high-strength steel structure that has four chords and tubular lacings, mounted on a base which is either crawler or truck mounted. Lattice-boom cranes weigh less and provide higher lifting capacities than a mobile telescopic crane of similar boom length. The lattice-boom cranes are the only category of crane that can pick and move simultaneously with a full-rated load. The lattice-boom sections, together with the crane base, are transported to and erected at a project site. 

We currently offer models of lattice-boom cranes with lifting capacities up to 2,500 U.S. tons, which are used to lift material and equipment in a wide variety of applications and end markets, including heavy construction, bridge and highway, duty cycle and infrastructure and energy-related projects. These cranes are also used by the value-added crane rental industry, which serves all of the above end markets. 

Lattice-boom crawler cranes may be classified according to their lift capacity &#8212; low capacity and high capacity. Low-capacity crawler cranes with 150 U.S. ton capacity or less are often utilized for general construction and duty-cycle applications. High-capacity crawler cranes with greater than 150 U.S. ton capacity are used to lift materials in a wide variety of applications and are often used in heavy construction, energy-related, stadium construction, petrochemical work, and dockside applications. We offer ten low-capacity models and nine high-capacity models. 

In 2014, we introduced the Variable Position Counterweight (VPC) system. The VPC system automatically positions the counterweight, which is suspended above the ground, to fit a required lift by automatically positioning the counterweight based on changes in boom angle and lifted load. This results in reduced ground preparation, lower ground-bearing pressure and less counterweights needed for a lift, all without sacrificing capacity. With the VPC system, customers will not have to buy, transport or install as much counterweight as compared with traditional configurations, and the counterweight boxes are designed to be used across multiple crane platforms. The enhanced crane capacities and reduced mobilization time on job sites means customers may save significant amounts of time and money. 

We also offer our lattice-boom crawler crane customers various attachments that provide our cranes with greater capacity in terms of height, movement and lifting. Our principal attachments are: MAX-ER&#8482; attachments, luffing jibs, and RINGER&#8482; attachments. The MAX-ER&#8482; is a trailing counterweight, heavy-lift attachment that dramatically improves the reach, capacity and lift dynamics of the basic crane to which it is mounted. It can be transferred between cranes of the same model for maximum economy and occupies less space than competitive heavy-lift systems. A luffing jib is a fabricated structure similar to, but smaller than, a lattice-boom. Mounted at the tip of a lattice-boom, a luffing jib easily adjusts its angle of operation permitting one crane with a luffing jib to make lifts at additional locations on the project site. It can be transferred between cranes of the same model to maximize utilization. A RINGER&#8482; attachment is a high-capacity lift attachment that distributes load reactions over a large area to minimize ground-bearing pressure. It can also be more economical than transporting and setting up a larger crane. 

Tower cranes . Under the Potain brand name, we design and manufacture tower cranes utilized primarily in the energy, building and construction industries. Tower cranes offer the ability to lift and distribute material at the point of use more quickly and accurately than other types of lifting machinery without utilizing substantial square footage on the ground. Tower cranes include a stationary vertical mast and a horizontal jib with a counterweight, which is placed near the vertical mast. A cable runs through a trolley which is mounted on the jib, enabling the load to move along the jib. The jib rotates 360 degrees, thus increasing the crane&#8217;s work area. Unless using a remote control device, operators occupy a cabin, located where the jib and mast meet, which provides superior visibility above the worksite. We offer a complete line of tower crane products, including top slewing, luffing jib, topless, self-erecting, and special cranes for dams, harbors and other large building projects. Top-slewing cranes are the most traditional form of tower cranes. Self-erecting cranes are bottom-slewing cranes which have a counterweight located at the bottom of the mast and are able to be erected, used and dismantled on job sites without assist cranes. 

Top-slewing tower cranes have a tower and multi-sectioned horizontal jib. These cranes rotate from the top of their mast and can increase in height with the project. Top-slewing cranes are transported in separate pieces and assembled at the construction site in one to three days depending on the height. We offer 23 models of top-slewing tower cranes with maximum jib lengths of 80 meters and lifting capabilities ranging between 3 and 80 metric tons. These cranes are generally sold to medium to large energy, building and construction groups, as well as to rental companies. 

Topless tower cranes are a type of top-slewing crane and, unlike all others, have no cathead or jib tie-bars on the top of the mast. The cranes are utilized primarily when overhead height is constrained or in situations where several cranes are installed close together. We currently offer 19 models of topless tower cranes with maximum jib lengths of 75 meters and lifting capabilities ranging between 1.1 and 16 metric tons. 

Luffing jib tower cranes, which are a type of top-slewing crane, have an angled rather than horizontal jib. Unlike other tower cranes which have a trolley that controls the lateral movement of the load, luffing jib cranes move their load by changing the angle of the jib. The cranes are utilized primarily in urban areas where space is constrained or in situations where several cranes are installed close together. We currently offer 11 models of luffing jib tower cranes with maximum jib lengths of 60 meters and lifting capabilities ranging between 1.6 and 32 metric tons. 

Self-erecting tower cranes are mounted on axles or transported on a trailer. The lower segment of the range (Igo cranes up to Igo50) unfolds in four sections, two for the mast and two for the jib. The smallest of our models unfolds in less than eight minutes; larger models erect in a few hours. Self-erecting cranes rotate from the bottom of their mast. We offer 20 models of self-erecting cranes with maximum jib lengths of 50 meters and lifting capacities ranging between .65 and 8 metric tons, which are utilized primarily in low to medium rise construction and residential applications. 

Mobile telescopic cranes . Under the Grove brand name we design and manufacture 34 models of mobile telescopic cranes utilized primarily in industrial, commercial and construction applications, as well as in maintenance applications to lift and move material at job sites. Mobile telescopic cranes consist of a telescopic boom mounted on a wheeled carrier. Mobile telescopic cranes are similar to lattice-boom cranes in that they are designed to lift heavy loads using a mobile carrier as a platform, enabling the crane to move on and around a job site without typically having to re-erect the crane for each particular job. Additionally, many mobile telescopic cranes have the ability to drive between sites, and some are permitted on public roadways. We currently offer the following four types of mobile telescopic cranes capable of reaching tip heights of up to 446 feet with lifting capacities up to 550 U.S. tons: rough-terrain, all-terrain, truck-mounted, and industrial. 

Rough-terrain cranes are designed to lift materials and equipment on rough or uneven terrain. These cranes cannot be driven on public roadways, and, accordingly, must be transported by truck to a work site. We produce, under the Grove brand name, 10 models of rough-terrain cranes capable of tip heights of up to 312 feet and maximum load capacities of up to 150 U.S. tons. 

All-terrain cranes are versatile cranes designed to lift materials and equipment on rough or uneven terrain and yet are highly maneuverable and capable of highway speeds. We produce, under the Grove brand name, 14 models of all-terrain cranes capable of tip heights of up to 449 feet and maximum load capacities of up to 550 U.S. tons. 

Truck-mounted cranes are designed to provide simple set-up and long reach high capacity booms and are capable of traveling from site to site at highway speeds. These cranes are suitable for urban and suburban uses. We produce, under the Grove brand name, three models of truck mounted cranes capable of tip heights of up to 237 feet and maximum load capacities of up to 110 U.S. tons. 

Industrial cranes are designed primarily for plant maintenance, storage yard and material handling jobs. We manufacture, under the Grove and Shuttlelift brand names, eight models of industrial cranes. We produce industrial cranes with up to 25 U.S. ton capacity and tip heights of up to 86 feet. 

Boom trucks. &#32;&#32;&#32;We offer our hydraulic boom truck products under the National Crane product line. A boom truck is a hydraulically powered telescopic crane mounted on a conventional truck chassis. Telescopic boom trucks are used primarily for lifting material on a job site and are mostly deployed by end users in the North American market. We currently offer, under the National Crane brand name, 22 models of telescoping boom trucks. The largest capacity cranes of this type are capable of reaching maximum heights of 205 feet and have lifting capacity up to 60 U.S. tons. 

Backlog . The year-end backlog of crane products includes accepted orders that have been placed on a production schedule that we expect to be shipped and billed primarily during the next year. Manitowoc&#8217;s backlog of unfilled orders for the Crane segment at December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was $513.0 million , $738.0 million &#32;and $574.0 million , respectively. Our backlog at the end of 2015 decreased from the end of 2014 due in part to lower customer demand for mobile hydraulic products, driven by declining oil prices and the associated impact across energy-related end markets. Additionally, our Crawler crane backlog shrunk as our production of the new VPC enabled units were shipped during the year, many of which had been in backlog since 2014 when the new technology was unveiled at ConExpo. 

Foodservice Equipment 

As noted above, after the Spin-Off, the company will not have any remaining interest in the Foodservice business. However, information is provided in this report related to the Foodservice business because it was part of the company in 2015 and remains part of the company until the Spin-Off occurs. 

Our Foodservice business designs, manufactures and sells primary cooking and warming equipment; ice-cube machines, ice flaker machines and storage bins; refrigerator and freezer equipment; beverage dispensers and related products; serving, warming and storage equipment; and aftermarket parts and service solutions. Our suite of products is used by commercial and institutional foodservice operators such as full service restaurants, quick-service restaurant (QSR) chains, hotels, caterers, supermarkets, convenience stores, business and industry, hospitals, schools and other institutions. We have a presence throughout the world&#8217;s most significant markets in the following product groups: 

Primary cooking and warming equipment. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We design, manufacture and sell a broad array of ranges, griddles, grills, combi ovens, convection ovens, conveyor ovens, induction cookers, broilers, tilt fry pans/kettles/skillets, braising pans, cheese melters/salamanders, cook stations, table top and countertop cooking/frying systems, fryers, steam jacketed kettles, and steamers.

The ice-cube machines are available either as self-contained units, which make and store ice, or as modular units, which make ice, but do not store it. 

Walk-in refrigerator and freezer equipment. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We design, manufacture and sell commercial upright and undercounter refrigerators and freezers, blast freezers, blast chillers and cook-chill systems under the Delfield brand name. We manufacture modular and fully assembled walk-in refrigerators, coolers and freezers, and prefabricated cooler and freezer panels for use in the construction of refrigerated storage rooms and environmental systems under the Kolpak brand name. We also design and manufacture customized refrigeration systems under the RDI Systems brand name. 

Beverage dispensers and related products. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We produce beverage dispensers, blended ice machines, ice/beverage dispensers, beer coolers, post-mix dispensing valves, backroom equipment and support system components and related equipment for use by quick-service restaurant chains, convenience stores, bottling operations, movie theaters, and the soft-drink industry. Our beverage and related products are sold under the Servend, Multiplex, TRUpour, and Manitowoc Beverage Systems brand names. 

Serving and storage equipment. &#32;&#32;&#32;We design, manufacture and sell a range of cafeteria/buffet equipment stations, bins, boxes, warming cabinets, display and deli cases, insulated and refrigerated salad/food bars, and warmers. Our equipment stations, cases, food bars and food serving lines are marketed under the Delfield and other brand names. 

Aftermarket parts and service solutions . We provide parts and aftermarket service as well as a wide variety of solutions under the KitchenCare brand name. 

The end-customer base for the Foodservice segment is comprised of a wide variety of foodservice providers, including large multinational and regional chain restaurants, convenience stores and retail stores; chain and independent casual and family dining restaurants; independent restaurants and caterers; lodging, resort, leisure and convention facilities; healthcare facilities; schools and universities; large business and industrial customers; and many other foodservice outlets. We serve some of the largest and most widely recognized multinational and regional businesses in the foodservice and hospitality industries. We do not typically have long-term contracts with our customers; however, large chains frequently authorize specific foodservice equipment manufacturers as approved vendors for particular products, and thereafter, sales are made locally or regionally to end customers via kitchen equipment suppliers, dealers or distributors. Many large quick-service restaurant chains refurbish or open a large number of outlets, or implement menu changes requiring investment in new equipment, over a short period of time. When this occurs, these customers often choose a small number of manufacturers whose approved products may or must be purchased by restaurant operators. We work closely with our customers to develop the products they need and to become approved vendors for these products. 

Our end-customers often need equipment upgrades that enable them to improve productivity and food safety, reduce labor costs, respond to enhanced hygiene, environmental and menu requirements or reduce energy consumption. These changes often require customized cooking and cooling and freezing equipment. In addition, many restaurants seek to differentiate their products by changing their menu and format. We believe that product development is important to our success because a supplier&#8217;s ability to provide customized or innovative foodservice equipment is a primary factor when customers are making their purchasing decisions. Our significant investment in new product research and development positions us to uniquely serve our global customer base. 

The Manitowoc Foodservice Education and Technology Centers (&#8220;ETC&#8221;) in New Port Richey, Florida and Hangzhou, China contain computer-assisted design platforms, a model shop for on-site development of prototypes, a laboratory for product testing, and various display areas for new products. Our test kitchens, flexible demonstration areas, and culinary teams enable us to demonstrate a wide range of equipment in realistic operating environments, and also support a wide range of menu ideation, food development and sensory testing with our customers and food partners. We also use the ETCs to provide training for our customers, marketing representatives, service providers, industry consultants, dealers and distributors. 

Backlog . The backlog for unfilled orders for our Foodservice segment at December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was not significant because orders are generally filled shortly after receiving the customer order. 

Raw Materials and Supplies 

The primary raw materials that we use are structural and rolled steel, aluminum, and copper, which are purchased from various domestic and international sources. We also purchase engines and electrical equipment and other semi- and fully-processed materials. Our policy is to maintain, wherever possible, alternate sources of supply for our important materials and parts. We maintain inventories of steel and other purchased material. We have been successful in our goal to maintain alternative sources of raw materials and supplies, and therefore are not dependent on a single source for any particular raw material or supply. 

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 

We hold numerous patents pertaining to our Crane and Foodservice products, and have presently pending applications for additional patents in the United States and foreign countries. In addition, we have various registered and unregistered trademarks and licenses that are of material importance to our business and we believe our ownership of this intellectual property is adequately protected in customary fashions under applicable laws. No single patent, trademark or license is critical to our overall business. 

Seasonality 

On a consolidated basis, the second and fourth quarters generally have represented the best quarters for our financial results. Crane's best quarters are historically the second and fourth quarters, while Foodservice's best quarters historically have been the second and third quarters. More recently, the traditional seasonality the our Crane and Foodservice segments has been slightly muted due to more diversified product and geographic end markets. In our Crane segment, the northern hemisphere summer represents the main construction season. Customers require new machines, parts, and service during that season. Since the summer brings warmer weather, there is also an increase in the use and replacement of ice machines, as well as new construction and remodeling within the foodservice industry. As a result, distributors typically. build inventories during the second quarter to prepare for increased demand. 

Competition 

We sell all of our products in highly competitive industries. We compete in each of our industries based on product design, quality of products and aftermarket support services, product performance, maintenance costs, energy and resource saving, other contributions to sustainability, and price. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing or distribution resources than we do. We believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages: strong brand names, which create customer loyalty and facilitate strong resale values, a reputation for quality products and aftermarket support and solution services, an established network of global distributors and customer relationships, broad product line offerings in the markets we serve, and a commitment to engineering design and product innovation. However, we cannot be certain that our products and services will continue to compete successfully or that we will be able to retain our customer base or improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers. The following table sets forth our primary competitors in each of our business segments:

Engineering, Research and Development 

We believe our extensive engineering, research and development capabilities have been key drivers of our success. We engage in research and development activities at dedicated locations within both of our segments. We have a staff of in-house engineers and technicians on three continents, supplemented with external engineering resources, who are responsible for improving existing products and developing new products. We incurred research and development costs of $83.6 million &#32;in 2015 , $87.4 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $86.4 million &#32;in 2013 . In 2015, approximately $ 57.6 million of these costs related to the Crane business, and $26 million to Foodservice. &#32; 

Our team of engineers focuses on developing innovative, high performance, low maintenance products that are intended to create significant brand loyalty among customers. Design engineers work closely with our manufacturing and marketing staff, enabling us to identify changing end-user requirements, implement new technologies and effectively introduce product innovations. Close, carefully managed relationships with dealers, distributors and end users help us identify their needs, not only for products, but for the service and support that are critical to their profitable operations. As part of our ongoing commitment to provide superior products, we intend to continue our efforts to design products that meet evolving customer demands and reduce the period from product conception to product introduction. 

Employee Relations 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 11,000 people and had labor agreements with 13 local unions in North America. A large majority of our European employees belong to European trade unions. We have three trade unions in China and one trade union in India. During 2015, three of our union contracts expired and were successfully renegotiated without incident. During 2016, six of our union contracts will expire.
