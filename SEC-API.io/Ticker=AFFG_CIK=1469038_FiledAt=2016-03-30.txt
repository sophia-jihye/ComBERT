 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in January 2006 and are a development stage company. Our business is to develop and operate Internet websites and applications on mobile platforms. We intend to earn revenues through advertisements sold on these websites and applications. Our goal is to become the largest network of consumer-based websites and applications targeting viewers in the Hong Kong and Greater China Basin with contents on travel, food, entertainment, activities and city life. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have launched the website www.drinkeat.com , which provides reviews of restaurants in Hong Kong.

&#160;

We plan to develop additional websites and solicit advertisement for those websites through third-party agents. Presently, we own the following domain names: www.domainextremes.com and www.drinkeat.com .

&#160;

In November 2012, we terminated Junk Calls. In the 1st quarter of 2014, we aborted the development of another iPhone application, BabyWorld because the developer was not able to deliver the final version of the application . 

&#160;

We are a controlled corporation with the substantial majority of our shares held by Mi1 Global Limited (&#8220;Mi1&#8221;), a company registered in the Republic of Vanuatu. Mi1 acquired an 51% stake in our company in February 2016. As a result, there can be no assurance that our business and/or our strategy will not change over time as a result of Mi1&#8217;s interest.

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

We are an active developer and operator of lifestyle-centered websites and mobile platform applications in the Hong Kong and Greater China Basin. We intend to build content centered on travel, food, city life and entertainment in the region.

&#160;

Our content is delivered through internet-connected browser-based devices such as personal computers, laptops and mobile devices. As a result, our content is available globally and our distribution is potentially unlimited in breadth. Thus, while our primary market focus is Hong Kong and the Greater China Basin, we are able to reach those consumers and content providers around the world who have an interest in this region.

&#160;

Our site www.drinkeat.com , also known as Hong Kong Restaurant Review, provides reviews on Hong Kong restaurants. We invite food critics to contribute review articles on restaurants in Hong Kong either for a small fee or by obtaining their consent to post a previously printed article without charge. Reviews are written in Chinese for the general public in Hong Kong and Chinese tourists who plan to visit Hong Kong. Contributors are paid a nominal fee on a per-article basis either in cash, if available, or through the issuance of shares in the Company. We rely on five active individual contributors to provide reviews, although we do not have formal agreements with any. There are several websites providing similar reviews on Hong Kong restaurants.

&#160;

We believe that www.drinkeat.com is among the top three of such websites in terms of popularity and depth of the articles. According to Google&#8217;s PageRank&#174;, www.drinkeat.com is one of three restaurant review websites in Hong Kong with a ranking of 5 or higher out of the maximum 10 as of the date of this Annual Report.

&#160;

According to Google&#8217;s corporate website, its PageRank&#174; system reflects its view of the importance of viewed web pages by considering more than 500 million variables and 2 billion terms. Pages that it believes are important pages receive a higher PageRank&#174; and are more likely to appear at the top of the search results. Google assigns a numeric weighting from 0-10 for each webpage on the Internet, with the PageRank&#174; denoting a site&#8217;s importance in the eyes of Google. The PageRank&#174; of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank&#174; of the pages providing the links. Other factors, such as the relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar, also influence the PageRank&#174;. However, in order to prevent manipulation, Google provides no specific details about how such other factors influence the resulting PageRank&#174;.

&#160;

&#160;

We launched our second website, www.sowhat.asia , in beta version, in the 4th quarter of 2009. This site provides a portal for members to post photos and videos focusing on areas in Hong Kong which they believe need improvement, including traffic, hygienic conditions, environmental issues and current affairs and others. The purpose of these postings is to attract the attention of government departments and concerned organizations with the ultimate objective that these issues will be rectified. Initial content has been provided by individuals known to the Company's management without compensation. The testing of this website did not bring in satisfactory results. The management decided to terminate this website in the 3 rd quarter of 2013.

&#160;

We will gradually develop other websites utilizing domain names we currently own or develop or acquire in the future. We plan to solicit advertisements through third party agents. Depending on the nature of the content of the websites, prospective advertisers include restaurants, hotels, travel agents, department stores and retail outlets. We also include pay-per-click advertisements in our websites. Our hope is that when our network of websites has increased to at least five, we will be able to attract and retain more traffic, redirecting users to other websites in our network.

&#160;

We have contracted with programming firms in Hong Kong and China to develop websites for our network. Once a domain name and theme have been decided by our directors, we contact potential development firms for initial discussion regarding our proposal. Our directors maintain close contact with the programming firms during development of the website and conduct testing throughout the development process. Additionally, we intend to carry out enhancements on our websites from time to time based upon member feedback.

&#160;

We will continue to develop lifestyle applications on iPhone and other mobile platforms.

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

In order to develop our platform, we intend to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Promote our existing websites to increase readership, popularity and site-loyalty through on-line advertisements, principally through search advertising and banner advertisements; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Launch a public relations campaign, through print and other media, to promote our websites; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Develop banner exchange programs with other websites; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Recruit additional writers and contributors to enhance and update site content to maintain the relevance of the information, as well as free-lance writers to publicize sites in related forums; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Utilize consultants to optimize search engines in order to enhance and maintain website ranking; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Expand the network through the application of new domain names, as well as the acquisition of websites and forums targeting the same consumer base; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Develop additional lifestyle-related mobile phone applications for iPhone and, where appropriate, other mobile platforms, and promote them using online key word search advertisements; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Generate revenue from user fees and online advertising income at space provided in mobile phone applications. &#160;

As noted above, we are a controlled corporation and there can be no assurance that our principal shareholder, Mi1 Global Limited, will not change our business or our strategy in the future.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We face intense competition from other online content providers who also offer lifestyle information services. These providers are not necessarily based in the Hong Kong or Greater China Basin region, but may be based anywhere in the world given the availability of the internet. We also face competition from new technologies that could potentially make demand for our website services outdated or inconvenient.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets and contract law rights in order to protect our brand, intellectual property assets and confidential or proprietary information (our &#8220;Proprietary Rights&#8221;). Our Proprietary Rights are among the most important assets we possess and we depend significantly on these Proprietary Rights in being able to effectively compete in our industry. We cannot be certain that the precautions we have taken to safeguard our Proprietary Rights will provide meaningful protection from the unauthorized use by others. If we must pursue litigation in the future to enforce or otherwise protect our Proprietary Rights, or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others, we may not prevail and will likely have to make substantial expenditures and divert valuable resources in the process. Moreover, we may not have adequate remedies if our Proprietary Rights are appropriated or disclosed.

&#160;

We hold Proprietary Rights to our domain names and, as we develop and acquire content for our sites, we intend to make trademark and copyright applications as appropriate to protect our intellectual property in Hong Kong and elsewhere as we deem appropriate. As we contract with other parties, including website and content developers and advertisers, we intend to ensure that our content and services do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. As a general matter, to date we have acquired and not licensed rights to content for our websites.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

There are currently no restrictions in Hong Kong on the dissemination of information through the Internet, except as stipulated in the &#8220;Control of Obscene and Indecent Article Ordinance&#8221; (COIAO). The contents of our existing websites, and those in development, do not fall into the categories subject to censorship under the COIAO.

&#160;

The Hong Kong Government is reviewing the filtering of information on the Internet to protect the youth from accessing obscene material. We do not believe that, even if new laws or regulations are enacted in this regard, our business activities would be affected given our target audience and content. However, if new technical requirements, such as filtering software, are imposed, data transmission speed could adversely be affected.

&#160;

We are not aware of any regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we intend primarily offer our content or services that would require us to be licensed to distribute content over the public Internet.

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had one full-time employee and four part-time employees taking care of website content development, testing and administrative matters. We intend to add full and part-time employees, as well as consultants, as our network continues to expand.

&#160;

We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationship with our employees is excellent.
