&#32;Part I 

Business 

&#160; 

General 

First Citizens BancShares, Inc. (BancShares) was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on August 7, 1986, to become the holding company of First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company (FCB), its banking subsidiary. FCB opened in 1898 as the Bank of Smithfield, Smithfield, North Carolina, and later became First-Citizens Bank &#38; Trust Company. BancShares has expanded through de novo branching and acquisitions and now operates in 18 states and the District of Columbia providing a broad range of financial services to individuals, businesses and professionals. As of December 31, 2015, BancShares had total assets of $31.48 billion . 

Throughout its history, the operations of BancShares have been significantly influenced by descendants of Robert P. Holding, who came to control FCB during the 1920s. Robert P. Holding&#8217;s children and grandchildren have served as members of the Board of Directors, as chief executive officers and in other executive management positions and, since our formation in 1986, have remained shareholders controlling a large percentage of our common stock. 

Our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Frank B. Holding, Jr., is the grandson of Robert P. Holding. Hope Holding Bryant, Vice Chairman of BancShares, is Robert P. Holding&#8217;s granddaughter. Frank B. Holding, son of Robert P. Holding and father of Frank B. Holding, Jr. and Hope Holding Bryant, was Executive Vice Chairman until his retirement in 2014. Peter M. Bristow, President and Corporate Sales Executive of BancShares, is Frank B. Holding's son-in-law. On February 14, 2014, Frank Holding announced that he would retire from his position as a director effective April 29, 2014, and retired from his positions as an officer of BancShares and FCB effective September 2, 2014. 

FCB seeks to meet the financial needs of both individuals and commercial entities in its market areas. Services offered at most offices include taking of deposits, cashing of checks and providing for individual and commercial cash needs; numerous checking and savings plans; commercial, business and consumer lending; a full-service trust department; wealth management services; and other activities incidental to commercial banking. FCB&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Citizens Investor Services, Inc. (FCIS), First Citizens Securities Corporation Inc. (FCSC) and First Citizens Asset Management, Inc. (FCAM), provide various investment products including annuities, discount brokerage services and third-party mutual funds to customers primarily through the bank's branch network, as well as investment advisory services. FCSC merged into FCIS effective January 1, 2016. 

A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our operations throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia and in certain urban areas of Georgia, Florida, California and Texas. We deliver products and services to our customers through our extensive branch network as well as online banking, telephone banking, mobile banking and various ATM networks. Business customers may conduct banking transactions through the use of remote image technology. 

FCB&#8217;s primary deposit markets are North Carolina and South Carolina. FCB&#8217;s deposit market share in North Carolina was 4.0 percent as of June 30, 2015 , based on the FDIC Deposit Market Share Report, which makes FCB the fourth largest bank in North Carolina. The three banks larger than FCB based on deposits in North Carolina as of June 30, 2015 , controlled 78.3 percent of North Carolina deposits. In South Carolina, FCB was the 4th largest bank in terms of deposit market share with 9.0 percent at June 30, 2015 . The three larger banks represent 45.5 percent of total deposits in South Carolina as of June 30, 2015 . 

FCB's market areas enjoy a diverse employment base, including, in various locations, manufacturing, service industries, healthcare, agricultural, wholesale and retail trade, technology and financial services. We believe the current market areas will support future growth in loans, deposits and our other banking services. We maintain a community bank approach to providing customer service, a competitive advantage that strengthens our ability to effectively provide financial products and services to individuals and businesses in our markets. However, like larger banks, we have the capacity to offer most financial products and services that our customers require. 

Statistical information regarding our business activities is found in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis. 

Geographic Locations and Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , FCB operated 559 &#32;branches in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia and the District of Columbia. BancShares and its subsidiaries employ approximately 5,734 &#32;full-time staff and approximately 498 &#32;part-time staff for a total of 6,232 &#32;employees. 

Business Combinations 

On February 13, 2015, FCB entered into an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as Receiver, to purchase certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Capitol City Bank &#38; Trust (CCBT). The acquisition expanded FCB's presence in Georgia as CCBT operated eight branch locations in Atlanta, Stone Mountain, Albany, Augusta and Savannah, Georgia. In June of 2015, FCB closed one of the branches in Atlanta. 

On October 1, 2014, BancShares completed the merger of First Citizens Bancorporation, Inc. (Bancorporation) with and into BancShares pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 10, 2014, as amended on July 29, 2014. For the period October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, Bancshares maintained two banking subsidiaries. On January 1, 2015, First Citizens Bank and Trust Company, Inc. (FCB-SC) merged with and into FCB. FCB remains the single banking subsidiary of BancShares. Other non-bank subsidiary operations do not have a significant effect on BancShares consolidated financial statements. 

On January 1, 2014, FCB completed its merger with 1st Financial Services Corporation (1st Financial) of Hendersonville, NC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mountain 1st Bank &#38; Trust Company (Mountain 1st). 

Regulatory Considerations 

The business and operations of BancShares and FCB are subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision. BancShares is a financial holding company registered with the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. It is subject to supervision and examination by, and the regulations and reporting requirements of, the Federal Reserve. 

FCB is a state-chartered bank, subject to supervision and examination by, and the regulations and reporting requirements of, the FDIC and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks. Deposit obligations are insured by the FDIC to the maximum legal limits. 

Various regulatory authorities supervise all areas of BancShares' and FCB's business including loans, allowances for loan and lease losses, mergers and acquisitions, the payment of dividends, various compliance matters and other aspects of its operations. The regulators conduct regular examinations, and BancShares and FCB must furnish periodic reports to its regulators containing detailed financial and other information. 

Numerous statutes and regulations apply to and restrict the activities of FCB, including limitations on the ability to pay dividends, capital requirements, reserve requirements, deposit insurance requirements and restrictions on transactions with related persons and entities controlled by related persons. The impact of these statutes and regulations is discussed below and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the United States and has a broad impact on the financial services industry. Although a significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been promulgated, certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be implemented. Given these uncertainties to how the federal bank regulatory agencies will implement the Dodd-Frank Act's requirements, the full extent of the impact of the Act on the operations of BancShares and FCB is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may affect the profitability of business activities, require changes to certain business practices, impose more stringent regulatory requirements or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial condition of BancShares and its subsidiaries. These changes may also require BancShares to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. 

The Dodd-Frank Act mandated that stress tests be developed and performed to ensure that financial institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during multiple economic and bank scenarios. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion, including BancShares, undergo annual company-run stress tests. As directed by the Federal Reserve, summaries of BancShares&#8217; results in the severely adverse stress tests were available to the public effective June 2015. The results of stress testing activities will be considered by our Risk Committee in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices as part of our risk management program. 

Consumer Financial Protections Bureau Regulation and Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a new agency with centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection. The CFPB has the authority to examine FCB for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage and other consumer financial products and services we offer. 

In addition, Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB broad authority to take corrective action against FCB as it deems appropriate. The CFPB also has powers that it was assigned in Dodd-Frank Act to issue regulations and take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The agency also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. These authorities are in addition to the authorities the CFPB assumed on July 21, 2011 under then-existing consumer financial laws governing the provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage related topics required under Dodd-Frank Act, including ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. On October 3, 2015, the CFPB&#8217;s final rules on integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act became effective which simplified and improved disclosure forms for mortgage transactions. 

BancShares 

General. &#32;&#32;As a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA), BancShares is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. BancShares is also registered under the bank holding company laws of North Carolina and is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks (NCCB). 

Permitted Activities . A bank holding company is limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies, such as BancShares, may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve), without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. 

Status Requirements. &#32;To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed.&#8221; A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it satisfies the requirements for this status under applicable Federal Reserve capital requirements. A depository institution subsidiary is considered &#8220;well managed&#8221; if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination. A financial holding company&#8217;s status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable Federal Reserve regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the Federal Reserve may require divestiture of the holding company&#8217;s depository institutions. 

Capital Requirements . The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on bank holding companies under the BHCA, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of &#8220;qualifying&#8221; capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are described below under &#8220;The Subsidiary Bank - FCB - Current Capital Requirements (Basel III)&#8221;. As of December 31, 2015 , the risk-based Tier 1, common equity Tier 1, total capital, and leverage capital ratios of BancShares were 12.65 percent , 12.51 percent , 14.03 percent &#32;and 8.96 percent , respectively, and each capital ratio listed above exceeded the applicable minimum requirements as well as the well-capitalized standards. Subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions, BancShares is able to borrow money to make capital contributions to FCB and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid by FCB to BancShares. 

Source of Strength . Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, BancShares is expected to commit resources to support FCB, including times when BancShares may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans made by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 

Safety and Soundness. The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance fund in the event of a depository institution default. 

Limits on Dividends and Other Payments. &#32;BancShares is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Revenues of BancShares primarily result from dividends paid to it by FCB. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by FCB to BancShares and to the payment of dividends by BancShares to its shareholders. The payment of dividends by FCB or BancShares may be limited by certain factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines. Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit FCB or BancShares from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting their business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of FCB or BancShares, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions such as FCB are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distributions, the institution would become &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; (as such term is used in the statute). Based on the FCB&#8217;s current financial condition, BancShares does not expect this provision will have any impact on its ability to receive dividends from FCB. BancShares' non-bank subsidiaries pay dividends to BancShares periodically on a non-regulated basis. 

Subsidiary Bank - FCB 

General. &#32;FCB is a state-chartered bank, subject to supervision and examination by, and the regulations and reporting requirements of, the FDIC and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks. 

The various laws and regulations administered by the bank regulatory agencies affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, incurrence of debt, and acquisition of financial institutions and other companies; they also affect business practices, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, types of business conducted, and location of offices. 

Current Capital Requirements (Basel III). &#32;On June 7, 2012, the Federal Reserve issued a series of proposed rules that would revise and strengthen its risk-based and leverage capital requirements and its method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The rules were proposed to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved certain revisions to the proposals and finalized new capital requirements for banking organizations. 

Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules required BancShares and FCB to comply with the following new minimum capital ratios: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 percent of risk-weighted assets; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0 percent of risk-weighted assets; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0 percent of total average assets. These are the initial capital requirements, which will be phased in over a four-year period. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require BancShares and FCB to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5 percent, plus a 2.5 percent &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5 percent common equity Tier 1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0 percent upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0 percent, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0 percent Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5 percent upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0 percent, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0 percent total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5 percent upon full implementation), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 percent, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets. 

The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625 percent of risk-weighted assets, increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5 percent on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 

With respect to FCB, the rules also revised the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA by (i) introducing a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required ratio being 6.5 percent for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0 percent (as compared to the previous 6.0 percent); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0 percent Tier 1 leverage ratio and still be well-capitalized. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015 , FCB exceeded the applicable minimum requirements as well as the well-capitalized standards. 

Prompt Corrective Action . Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. The federal bank regulatory agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions. &#8220;Well capitalized&#8221; institutions may generally operate without supervisory restriction. With respect to &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; institutions, such banks cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave it undercapitalized, they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, it would be undercapitalized, and they cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC. 

Transactions with Affiliates . Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, the authority of FCB to engage in transactions with related parties or &#8220;affiliates&#8221; or to make loans to insiders is limited. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between FCB and its affiliates, including the sale of assets, the payment of money or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to FCB, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, FCB generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates. 

FCB receives management fees from its subsidiaries and BancShares for expenses incurred for performing various functions on their behalf. These fees are charged to each company based upon the estimated cost for usage of services by that company. The fees are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. 

Community Reinvestment Act . FCB is subject to the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA). The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of the local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. If FCB receives a rating from the Federal Reserve of less than &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; under the CRA, restrictions on operating activities would be imposed. In addition, in order for a financial holding company, like BancShares, to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination under the CRA. FCB currently has a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating. 

Privacy Legislation . Several recent laws, including the Dodd-Frank Act, and related regulations issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies, provide new protections against the transfer and use of customer information by financial institutions. A financial institution must provide to its customers information regarding its policies and procedures with respect to the handling of customers&#8217; personal information. Each institution must conduct an internal risk assessment of its ability to protect customer information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer&#8217;s personal financial information to unaffiliated parties without prior notice and approval from the customer. 

USA Patriot Act of 2001 . In October 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) was enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and Northern Virginia. The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen U. S. law enforcement and the intelligence communities&#8217; abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism. The continuing impact on financial institutions of the Patriot Act and related regulations and policies is significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities to identify persons who may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. 

Volcker Rule . The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and prohibits them from owning equity interests in excess of 3 percent of Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds (Volcker Rule). On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule. These final rules prohibit banking entities from (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (ii) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The final rules are intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The final rules also require each regulated entity to establish an 

internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Although the final rules provide some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including BancShares and FCB. The final rules were effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period was extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 to July 21, 2015. The adoption of the Volcker Rule did not have any material effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. 

Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule . Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (effective January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring creditors to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Creditors are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the creditor to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the creditor can originate &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3 percent of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. All mortgage loans originated by FCB meet Ability-to-Repay standards and a substantial majority also meet Qualified Mortgage standards. This mix provides the ability to serve the needs of a broad customer base.
