 Item 1. Business 

Company Overview 

We are a market leader and a pioneer in the new era of healthcare delivery and payment, in which leading health systems and physician organizations, which we refer to as providers, are taking on increasing clinical and financial responsibility for the populations they serve. Our purpose-built platform, powered by our technology, proprietary processes and integrated services, enables providers to migrate their economic orientation from FFS reimbursement to payment models that reward high-quality and cost-effective care, or value-based payment models. By partnering with providers to accelerate their path to value-based care, we enable our provider partners to expand their market opportunity, diversify their revenue streams, grow market share and improve the quality of the care they provide. 

We consider value-based care to be the necessary convergence of healthcare payment and delivery. We believe the pace of this convergence is accelerating, driven by price pressure in traditional FFS healthcare, a regulatory environment that is incentivizing value-based care models, a rapid expansion of retail insurance driven by the emergence of the health insurance exchanges and innovation in data and technology. We believe providers are positioned to lead this transition to value-based care because of their control over large portions of healthcare delivery costs, their primary position with consumers and their strong local brand. 

Today, increasing numbers of providers are adopting value-based strategies, including contracting for capitated arrangements with existing insurance companies, governmental payers or large self-funded employers and managing their own captive health plans. Through value-based care, providers are in the early stages of transforming their role in healthcare as they attempt to defend their existing position and capture a greater portion of the more than $2 trillion in annual health insurance expenditures. While approximately 10% of healthcare payments were paid through value-based care programs as of June 2014, including through models created by systems like UPMC, Kaiser Permanente and Intermountain Healthcare, it is estimated that this number will grow to over 50% by 2020. There were over 100 provider-owned health plans as of 2014 and this number continues to grow. The number of ACOs constructed to manage capitated or value-based arrangements with existing insurance companies or government payers grew to 742 by the end of 2014. 

We believe the transformation of the provider business model will require a set of core capabilities, including the ability to aggregate and understand disparate clinical and financial data, standardize and integrate technology into care processes, manage population health and build a financial and administrative infrastructure that capitalizes on the clinical and financial value it delivers. We provide an end-to-end, built-for-purpose, technology-enabled services platform for providers to transition their organization and business model to succeed in value-based payment models. The core elements of our platform include: 

&#8226; 

Identifi &#174; , our technology platform, &#32;delivers the data aggregation and stratification, proven value-based care content, EMR optimization and proprietary applications that allow providers to standardize the delivery of care and enable clinical and financial analytics. 

&#8226; 

Integrated technology, proprietary process and clinical services model &#32;that enables the delivery of a high-performing population health organization, an aligned clinical delivery network to provide high-quality, coordinated care and an efficient administrative infrastructure to administer value-based care payment relationships. 

&#8226; 

Long-term, embedded and aligned partnerships with health systems &#32;to enable us and our provider partners to grow together as we manage increasing populations under value-based care arrangements. 

&#8226; 

Integration into provider clinical processes &#32;allows for traditional cost management solutions, such as PBM, radiology benefit management and patient risk scoring and adjustment, to achieve greater adoption and performance than traditional payer led models. 

&#8226; 

Payer-agnostic and a single point of integration between payers and the provider community . This indispensable single point of integration between a diverse set of payers becomes more valuable over time as our platform becomes the standard for value-based care contracting and operations. 

We believe we are pioneers in enabling health systems to succeed in value-based payment models. We were founded in 2011 by members of our management team, UPMC, an integrated delivery system based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and The Advisory Board, to enable providers to pursue a value-based business model and evolve their competitive position and market opportunity. Our mission, technology and services were developed with UPMC, which operates the nation&#8217;s largest provider-owned health plan after Kaiser Permanente, and The Advisory Board, whose best practice research and technology solutions were available to a membership base of over 3,900 hospitals and providers as of March 2015. 

We have developed what we believe is a unique partner development model. Most partner relationships begin with our transformation services, during which a partner engages us to develop a customized value-based care execution plan. This allows us to define the opportunity for our partners and embed our technology and processes while building confidence and trust that we are the best long-term infrastructure partner for the provider&#8217;s value-based care strategy. We then transition our partner to our platform and operations 

phase, which is governed by a long-term contract. We incur significant expenses in securing new partner relationships, and, in 2015, our business development expenses represented approximately 8% of our total revenues. 

We believe our business model provides strong visibility and aligns our partners&#8217; incentives with our own. A large portion of our revenue is derived from our multi-year contracts, which are linked to the number of members that our partners are managing under a value-based care arrangement. This variable pricing model depends on the number of services and technology applications that our partners utilize to advance their value-based care strategies and the number of members they are able to attract over time. We expect to grow with current partners as they increase membership in their existing value-based programs, through expanding the number of services we provide to our existing partners and by adding new partners. 

We believe we are in the early stages of capitalizing on these long-term aligned partnerships. Our health system partners&#8217; current value-based care arrangements represent less than 10% of the health system partners&#8217; total revenue each year. We believe the proportion of value-based care related revenues to total health system revenues will continue to grow, driven by continued price pressure in FFS, new government payment programs, growth in consumer-focused insurance programs, such as Medicare Advantage and the health insurance exchanges, and innovation in data and technology. Our business model benefits from scale, as we leverage our purpose-built technology platform and centralized resources in conjunction with the growth of our partners&#8217; membership base. These resources include our network development capabilities, PBM administration, technology development, clinical program development and data analytics and network development. While our absolute investment in our centralized resources and technologies will increase over time, we expect it will decrease as a percentage of revenue as we are able to scale this investment across a broader group of partners. 

Initial Public Offering and Organizational Transactions 

On June 5, 2015, we completed an IPO of 13,225,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received $209.1 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, but before offering expenses of $3.2 million. We used the net proceeds to purchase newly-issued Class A common units from Evolent Health LLC, our consolidated subsidiary. Evolent Health LLC will use the net proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

Historically, our business was operated through Evolent Health LLC and its predecessor. Evolent Health, Inc., was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 12, 2014, for the purpose of our IPO, and prior to the IPO engaged only in activities in contemplation of our IPO. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO in June 2015, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to, among other things, authorize two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock (the &#8220;Offering Reorganization&#8221;). Pursuant to the Offering Reorganization, Evolent Health, Inc. merged with Evolent Health Holdings and an affiliate of TPG. In accordance with the terms of the mergers, each of the then-existing stockholders of Evolent Health Holdings, including UPMC, The Advisory Board, TPG, as well as certain other entities, existing customers and employees, received a certain number of shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for each share of common stock it held in Evolent Health Holdings, and TPG received a certain number of shares of our Class A common stock in exchange for 100% of the equity that it held in its affiliate that was merged with Evolent Health, Inc. In addition, pursuant to the Offering Reorganization we issued shares of our Class B common stock to TPG and The Advisory Board, each of which was a member of Evolent Health LLC prior to the Offering Reorganization. Shares of our Class B common stock vote together with shares of our Class A common stock as a single class, except as otherwise required by law or pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws. Each Class B common unit of Evolent Health LLC can be exchanged (together with a corresponding number of shares of our Class B common stock) for one share of our Class A common stock and is otherwise non-transferable pursuant to an exchange agreement. 

The diagram below shows our organizational structure immediately after the Offering Reorganization and IPO: 

(1) &#160; 

After completion of the Offering Reorganization and the IPO, the following partners beneficially own shares of our Class A common stock: MedStar Health, Inc. and Premier Health Partners. 

Percentage economic interest are expressed in terms of an economic interest in Evolent Health LLC. 

Substantially all of our operations will continue to be conducted through Evolent Health LLC, and subsequent to the Offering Reorganization the financial results of Evolent Health LLC are consolidated in the financial statements of Evolent Health, Inc. Evolent Health, Inc. is a holding company whose principal asset is all of the Class A common units it holds in Evolent Health LLC, and its only business is to act as sole managing member of Evolent Health LLC. For more information regarding the Offering Reorganization, see &#8220;Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4.&#8221; 

Our Market Opportunity 

In 2016, healthcare spending in the United States is projected to be more than $3 trillion, of which we estimate $1 trillion to be waste. We believe that a fundamental shift to value-based care can address this $1 trillion opportunity. We believe that for the U.S. healthcare system to shift to a value-based care delivery model, providers must be an empowered part of the solution. Our comprehensive technology and services platform enables providers to capitalize on this transition, which we believe will position us to be at the forefront of the transformation to value-based care. 

We believe our total market opportunity is over $10 billion today based on health insurance expenditures, the total percentage of payments providers receive under value-based contracting, the size of the provider-sponsored health plan market and the fees we believe we can charge. We believe this opportunity will grow to over $46 billion by 2020 driven by health insurance expenditures increasing from approximately $2.1 trillion in 2013 to approximately $3.2 trillion in 2020, the total percentage of payments providers receive under value-based care models growing from 10% to 50%, and the provider-sponsored health plan market representing 15% of total health plan membership. 

Our Solution 

We provide an end-to-end, built-for-purpose, technology-enabled services platform for providers to succeed in value-based payment models. 

Our long-term partnerships typically begin with a system transformation process called the Blueprint, where we work with a provider&#8217;s board of directors and senior management to assess their ability to succeed in value-based payment models. This process acts as a channel for long-term partnerships, as a significant portion of providers that make an investment in a Blueprint continue to partner with us for our proprietary processes and integrated services, which we refer to as our Value-Based Operations. 

Once our platform is integrated into the clinical and financial systems of our provider partners through the Blueprint and implementation phase, our Value-Based Operations, including our technology-enabled services platform, support the execution and administration of a provider&#8217;s value-based care models on an ongoing basis. Value-Based Operations include Identifi&#174;, our technology backbone, Population Health Services to enable provider-led management of the population and Financial and Administrative Management to measure performance and administer and capture the value of improved care. 

Supporting Multiple Value-Based Care Models 

Our platform was built to support a diverse set of provider value-based care strategies. It provides the core technology and services necessary for all models pursued by providers. 

Providers partner with us on at least one of three types of value-based contracting models, with most supporting at least the Direct to Employer model and one additional type of contracting arrangement. 

&#8226; 

Direct to Employer: Manage costs for self-funded employers including a health system&#8217;s own employees 

&#8226; 

Payer contracts: Value-based contracts with third-party payers (including commercial insurers and the government) that include a full spectrum of risk for bundled payments, pay for performance to full capitation 

&#8226; 

Health plan: Launching a provider-owned health plan allows providers to control all of the healthcare insurance premiums, or premium dollars, across multiple populations, including commercial, Medicare and Medicaid 

Our partners benefit from a single platform that enables them to utilize our core suite of ongoing solutions, regardless of the size or type of value-based care models they are pursuing. Our platform grows through health systems increasing membership in their existing value-based care payment model, as well as their pursuit of additional payer contracts and health plans. 

Identifi&#174; 

Identifi&#174; is our proprietary technology platform that aggregates and analyzes data, manages care workflows and engages patients. Identifi&#174; links our processes with those of our provider partners and other third parties in order to create a connected clinical delivery ecosystem, stratify patient populations, standardize clinical work flows and enable high-quality, cost-effective care. The configurable nature and broad capabilities of Identifi&#174; help enhance the benefits our partners receive from our Value-Based Operations and increase the effectiveness of our partners&#8217; existing technology architecture. Highlights of the capabilities of Identifi&#174; include the following: 

&#8226; 

Data and integration services : Data from disparate sources, such as EMRs, and lab and pharmacy data, is collected, assembled, integrated and maintained in order to provide healthcare professionals with a holistic view of the patient. 

&#8226; 

Clinical and business content : Clinical and business content is applied to the integrated data to create actionable information in order to optimize clinical and financial performance. 

&#8226; 

EMR optimization : Data and clinical insights from Identifi&#174; are fed back into partner EMRs, which are optimized to improve both provider and patient satisfaction, create workflow efficiencies, promote clinical documentation and coding and provide clinical support at the point-of-care. 

&#8226; 

Applications : A suite of cloud-based applications manages the clinical, financial and operational aspects of the value-based model. Our applications are individually purchased and scale with the clinical, financial and administrative needs of a provider partners. As additional capabilities are required through our platform, they are often deployed as applications through the Identifi&#174; platform. 

Value-Based Operations 

Our Value-Based Operations are empowered and supported by Identifi&#174;. Other elements include: (1) an aligned clinical delivery network to provide improved, coordinated care, (2) a high-performing population health organization that drives clinical outcomes and (3) an efficient administrative infrastructure to administer value-based payments. We integrate change management processes and ongoing physician-led transformation into all value-based services to build engagement, integration and alignment within our partners in order to successfully deliver value-based care and sustain performance. We have standardized the processes described below and are able to leverage our expertise across our entire partner base. Through the technological and clinical integration we achieve, our solutions are delivered as ingrained components of our partner&#8217;s core operations rather than add-on solutions. 

Delivery Network Alignment 

We help our partners build the capabilities that are required to develop and maintain a coordinated and financially-aligned provider network that can deliver high-quality care necessary for value-based contracts. These capabilities include: 

&#8226; 

High-performance network : Supporting the capabilities needed to build, maintain and optimize provider- and clinically-integrated networks. 

&#8226; 

Value compensation models : Developing and supporting physician incentive payment programs that are linked to quality outcomes, payer shared savings arrangements and health plan performance. 

&#8226; 

Integrated specialty partnerships : Supporting the technology-enabled strategies, analytics and staff needed to optimize network referral patterns. 

Population Health Performance 

Population Health Performance is an integrated suite of technology-enabled solutions that supports the delivery of quality care in an environment where a provider&#8217;s need to manage health has significantly expanded. These solutions include: 

&#8226; 

Clinical programs : Care processes and ongoing clinical innovation that enables providers to target the right intervention at the right time for a given patient. 

&#8226; 

Specialized care team : Multi-disciplinary team that is deployed telephonically from a centralized location or throughout a local market to operate clinical programs, engage patients and support physicians. 

&#8226; 

Patient engagement : Integrated technologies and processes that enable outreach to engage patients in their own care process. 

&#8226; 

Quality and risk coding : Engagement of physicians to identify opportunities to close gaps in care and improve clinical documentation efforts. 

Financial and Administrative Management 

We help providers assemble the complete infrastructure required to operate, manage and capitalize on a variety of value-based payment arrangements. These capabilities include: 

&#8226; 

Payer risk : The capabilities needed to successfully manage risk from payers, including analysis, data and operational integration with payer processes, and ongoing performance management. Included in this capability is our Payer Value Alliance, which leverages our national scale to support providers with a common, sustainable, financial and clinical framework across contracted payers. 

&#8226; 

Analytics and reporting : The ongoing and ad hoc analytic teams and reports required to measure, inform and improve performance, including population health analytics, market analytics, network evaluation, staffing models, physician effectiveness, clinical delivery optimization and patient engagement. 

&#8226; 

Health plan : The scaled administrative capabilities required to launch and operate a provider-sponsored health plan, including sales and marketing, product development, actuarial, regulatory and compliance, member services, claims administration, provider relations, finance and utilization management. 

&#8226; 

Leadership and management : Our local and national talent assist our partners in effectively managing the performance of their value-based operations. 

Pharmacy benefit management 

The team of professionals to support the drug component of providers&#8217; plan offerings with national buying power and dedicated resources that are tightly integrated with the care delivery model. Differentiated from what we consider to be traditional PBMs, our solution is integrated into patient care and engages population health levers including generic utilization, provider management, and utilization management to reduce unit pharmacy costs. 

Centralized infrastructure 

Our solution was built to provide operating leverage that benefits from our continued growth. We leverage our purpose-built technology platform and centralized resources in conjunction with the growth in our partners&#8217; membership base. Our centralized resources and technologies include our network development capabilities, PBM administration, technology infrastructure, clinical program development and data analytics. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the transformations occurring in healthcare payment and delivery described above. We believe this new environment that rewards the better use of information to drive patient outcomes aligns with our platform, recent investments and other competitive strengths. 

Early Innovator 

We believe we are an innovator in the delivery of a comprehensive value-based care solution for providers. We were founded in 2011, ahead of the implementation of the ACA, health insurance exchanges and before the rapid expansion of programs, such as Medicare ACOs or Medicare Bundled Payment Initiatives. Since our inception, we have invested a significant amount in our offerings. 

Comprehensive Technology Platform 

Our proprietary technology platform, Identifi&#174;, allows us to deliver a connected delivery ecosystem, implement replicable clinical processes, scale our Value-Based Operations and capitalize on multiple types of value-based payment relationships. The Identifi&#174; platform supports the following capabilities: 

&#8226; 

Data aggregation from internal and external sources, such as EMRs and payer claims; 

&#8226; 

Algorithmic interpretation of aggregated data to stratify populations and identify high-risk patients; 

&#8226; 

Standardized workflows and dashboards to enable consistency across disparate clinical resources; 

&#8226; 

Applications to support value-based business models; 

&#8226; 

Patient outreach and engagement tools; 

&#8226; 

Integration into physician workflows to proactively engage high-priority patients; and 

&#8226; 

Reporting and tracking of clinical and financial outcomes. 

We believe we are creating scaled benefits for our provider partners in areas such as data analytics, administrative services and care management. We expect Identifi&#174; to enable us to deliver increasing levels of efficiency to our provider partners. 

Provider-Centric Brand Identity 

We believe our provider-centric brand identity and origins differentiate us from our competitors. We believe our solutions, which have built on capabilities developed at UPMC, resonate with potential partners seeking proven solutions from providers rather than payers or non-healthcare businesses. Our analytical and clinical solutions are rooted in UPMC&#8217;s experience in growing a provider-led, integrated delivery network over the past 15 years, and growing to become one of the largest provider-owned health plans in the country. In addition, our deep strategic partnership with The Advisory Board strengthens our brand as a provider-friendly organization. The Advisory Board is well-recognized as an industry thought leader that made its research and technology solutions available to approximately 3,900 hospitals and providers as of March 2015. Our position as a payer-agnostic services organization allows for the sharing of data across multiple payers and care delivery integration regardless of payer, which we believe is not possible with payer led solutions. 

Partnership-Driven Business Model 

Our business model is predicated on long-term strategic partnerships with leading providers that are attempting to evolve two of their most critical business functions: how they deliver care and how they are compensated for it. The partnership model enables cultural alignment, integration into the provider care delivery and payment work flow, long-term contractual relationships and a cycle of clinical and cost improvement with shared financial benefit. We devote significant resources, primarily in the form of business development, to establish relationships with our partners. For 2015, our business development expenses represented approximately 8% of our total revenues. Thereafter, beginning with the Blueprint phase of our engagement with a partner, our costs to serve our partners primarily consist of personnel-related costs for the deployment of our solution. We expect our business development expenses as a percentage of revenue to decline over time. As of December 31, 2015, our average contractual relationship with our partners was over six years, with an average of 4.7 years of performance remaining per contract. As of December 31, 2015, we had entered into long-term contractual relationships with eleven partners and we have subsequently entered into a long-term contractual relationship with one additional partner. Our five largest partners in 2015, Piedmont WellStar Health Plan, Indiana University Health, WakeMed Health and Hospitals, Premier Health Partners and MedStar Health, Inc. comprised 19.6%, 15.6%, 14.1%, 11.8% and 11.2%, respectively, of our revenue for 2015, or 72.3% in the aggregate. See &#8220;Part II - Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview&#8221; for additional discussion about our largest partners. 

Channel Development 

Our heritage, having been founded by UPMC, one of the largest providers in the country, and The Advisory Board with over 3,900 hospital and provider members as of March 2015, along with the relationships fostered by our senior management team, have allowed us to develop a significant channel into leading health systems. Our solution empowers a fundamental shift in a provider&#8217;s business model and requires alignment of their senior management and board of directors for success. A significant portion of providers that make an investment in a Blueprint continue to partner with us for our proprietary process and integrated services, which we refer to as our Value-Based Operations. 

Our business model creates additional channel development through our Blueprint services. Our Blueprint not only enables providers with a roadmap to value-based care and the financial implications of the transition, it also creates a connection between us and the provider&#8217;s senior leadership. As a result, we derive revenues from providers who have completed the Blueprint phase and proceed to partner with us to enable their transition to value-based contracting. 

Proven Leadership Team 

We have made a significant investment in building an industry-leading management team. Our senior leadership team has extensive experience in the healthcare industry and a track record of delivering measurable clinical, financial and operational improvement for healthcare providers and payers. Our chief executive officer, Frank Williams, was formerly the chief executive officer of The Advisory Board, where he oversaw the growth of the company and its IPO. 

Growth Opportunities 

Multiple Avenues for Growth with Our Existing, Embedded Partner Base 

We have established a multi-year partnership model with multiple drivers of embedded growth through the following avenues: 

&#8226; 

growth in lives in existing covered populations; 

&#8226; 

partners expanding into new lines of value-based care to capture growth in new profit pools; and 

&#8226; 

partners utilizing our additional capabilities, such as new Identifi&#174; applications, PBM and TPA. 

In addition to growth within our existing partner base, opportunities exist with providers utilizing our Blueprint, who sign short-term contracts under which we analyze the opportunities available to them in the value-based care market. Since our inception we have converted the majority of our Blueprints into long-term operating partnerships. From time to time, we also evaluate and consider pursuing opportunities to expand into businesses related to the services we currently provide. 

Early Stages of a Rapidly Growing Transformational Addressable Market 

We believe that our existing partners represent a small fraction of health systems that could benefit from our solutions. The transformation of the care delivery and payment model in the United States has been rapid, but it is still in the early stages. While approximately 10% of healthcare payments were paid through value-based care programs as of June 2014, it is estimated that this number will grow to over 50% by 2020. 

Capitalize on Growth in Select Government-Driven Programs 

Significant growth is projected in the number of people managed by government-driven programs in the United States over the next 8 years. Specifically, the CMS projects the number of Medicare beneficiaries to grow to approximately 63 million by 2020. We expect health systems to be direct beneficiaries of growth in Medicare Advantage, Medicaid Managed Care, Dual Eligible and health insurance exchanges because those specific markets are well suited for value-based care. We believe that the growth in government programs will create an opportunity for health systems to capture a greater portion of the over $2 trillion in annual health insurance expenditures. The nature of our variable fee economic model enables us to benefit from this growth in government-managed lives. 

Ability to Capture Additional Value Through Delivering Clinical Results 

We are capturing only a portion of the administrative dollars in the market through our current solution, which represent over 10% of total premium dollars. We believe there is a significant opportunity to capture a portion of the medical dollar over time - namely the remainder of the premium dollar which goes to medical expenses. As our health system partners continue to own a larger percentage of overall premiums, we have begun to pursue business models that allow us to participate in the medical savings through shared savings agreements that align incentives to reduce costs and improve quality outcomes. 

Expand Platform Offerings to Meet Evolving Market Needs 

There are multiple business offerings that health systems may require to operate in a value-based care environment that we do not currently provide, including but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

PBM expansion to include additional specialty pharmacy management capabilities; 

&#8226; 

Health savings account administration; 

&#8226; 

On-site or specialty clinic platforms; and 

&#8226; 

Consumer engagement and digital outreach. 

Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions 

We believe that the nature of our competitive landscape provides meaningful acquisition opportunities. Our industry is in the early stages of its life cycle and there are multiple firms attempting to capitalize on the transformation of the care delivery model and the various forms of new profit pools. We believe that providers will require an end-to-end solution and we believe we are well positioned to meet this demand by expanding the breadth of our offerings through not only organic growth, but also the acquisition of niche providers and non-core portions of larger enterprises. From time to time we may also pursue acquisition opportunities of businesses related to services we currently provide. As an example of executing on our strategy, in February 2016 we entered into a strategic alliance with a leading nonprofit community-based and provider-sponsored health plan administering Kentucky Medicaid and federal Medicare Advantage benefits. See &#8220;Part II - Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Overview&#8221; for additional details about the strategic alliance. 

Sales and Marketing 

We market and sell our services to providers throughout the United States. Our dedicated sales team targets provider opportunities for our platform solutions. Our sales team works closely with our leadership team and subject matter experts to foster long-term relationships with our provider partner&#8217;s leadership and board of directors given the long-term nature of our partnerships. Our dedicated business development team works closely with our partners to identify additional service opportunities that can be offered from our platform on a continuous basis. 

Partner Relationships 

Our business model is predicated on long-term strategic partnerships with leading providers that are attempting to evolve two of their most critical business functions: how they deliver care and how they are compensated for it. The partnership model enables cultural alignment, integration into the provider care delivery and payment work flow, long-term contractual relationships and a cycle of clinical and cost improvement with shared financial benefit. 

We have sought to partner with leading providers in sizable markets, which we believe creates a growth cycle that benefits from the secular transition to value-based care. By helping these systems lower clinical and administrative costs, we believe we are positioning them to offer a low cost, effective care setting to payers, employers and consumers, which enables them to capture greater market share. As providers have succeeded in lowering costs and growing market share, this enables them to increase their value-based offerings. By virtue of our business model, we benefit from our partners&#8217; growth. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had entered into long-term contractual relationships with eleven partners and we have subsequently entered into a long-term contractual relationship with one additional partner. As of December 31, 2015, our average contractual relationship with our partners was over six years, with an average of 4.7 years of performance remaining per contract. The contracts governing the relationships with our partners include key terms that define the period of performance, revenue rates, advanced billing terms, service level agreements, termination clauses, exclusivity clauses and right of first refusal clauses. 

Typically, the terms of these contracts provide for a monthly payment that is calculated based on a specified rate multiplied by the number of members that our partners are managing under a value-based care arrangement. The specified rate varies depending on which market-facing solutions the partner has adopted and the number of services and technology applications they are utilizing. Typically, the terms of these contracts allow for advance billing of our partners. In some of our contracts, a defined portion of the revenue is at risk and can be refunded to the partner if certain service levels are not attained. We monitor our compliance with the service levels to determine whether a refund will be provided and record an estimate of these refunds. 

Although the revenue from our long-term contracts is not guaranteed because certain of our contracts are terminable for convenience by our partners after a notice period has passed, certain partners would be required to pay us a termination fee in certain circumstances. Termination fees and the related notice period in certain of our contracts are determined based on the scope of the market-facing solutions that the partner has adopted and the duration of the contract. Most of our contracts include cure periods for certain breaches, during which time we may attempt to resolve any issues that would trigger a partner&#8217;s ability to terminate the contract. However, certain of our contracts are also terminable immediately on the occurrence of certain events. For example, some of our contracts may be terminated by the partner if we fail to achieve target performance metrics over a specified period. Certain of our contracts may be terminated by the partner immediately following repeated failures by us to provide specified levels of service over periods ranging from six months to more than a year. Certain of our contracts may be terminated immediately by the partner if we lose applicable licenses, go bankrupt, lose our liability insurance, become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or receive an exclusion, suspension or debarment from state or federal government authorities. 

The contracts often contain exclusivity or other restrictive provisions, which may limit our ability to partner with or provide services to other providers or purchase services from other vendors within certain time periods and in certain geographic areas. The exclusivity and other restrictive provisions are negotiated on an individual basis and vary depending on many factors, including the term and scope of the contract. The time limit on these exclusivity and other restrictive provisions typically corresponds to the term of the 

contract. These exclusivity or other restrictive provisions often apply to specific competitors of our health system partners or specific geographic areas within a particular state or an entire state, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, exceptions for employer plan entities that have operations in the restricted geographic areas but that are headquartered elsewhere. Accordingly, these exclusivity clauses may prevent us from entering into long-term relationships with certain potential partners. 

The contracts with our partners impose other obligations on us. For example, we typically agree that all services provided under the partner contract and all employees providing such services will comply with our partner&#8217;s policies and procedures. In addition, in most instances, we have agreed to indemnify our partners against certain third-party claims, which may include claims that our services infringe the intellectual property rights of such third parties. 

Competition 

The market for our products and services is fragmented, competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology standards, customer needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. Our competitors range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities. 

We compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvement through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition and the ability to integrate services with existing technology. We also compete on the basis of price. 

Healthcare Laws and Regulations 

Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. The following are summaries of key federal and 

state laws and regulations that impact our operations: 

Healthcare Reform 

In March 2010, the ACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we refer to, collectively, as healthcare reform, was signed into law. Healthcare reform contains provisions that have changed and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways. For example, healthcare reform includes a mandate requiring individuals to be insured or face tax penalties; a mandate that employers with over 50 employees offer their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties; prohibitions against insurance companies that offer Individual Major Medical plans using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve healthcare quality; establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate access to, and the purchase of, health insurance; and subsidies and cost-sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels. 

Healthcare reform amended various provisions in many federal laws, including the Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Public Health Services Act. Healthcare reform is being implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor and the Department of Treasury. Most of the ACA regulations became effective on January 1, 2014. 

Although the United States Supreme Court upheld healthcare reform&#8217;s mandate requiring individuals to purchase health insurance in 2012, some uncertainty about whether parts of healthcare reform or ACA regulations will remain in effect or be further amended is expected to continue with the possibility of future litigation with respect to certain provisions as well as legislative efforts to repeal and defund portions of healthcare reform or healthcare reform in its entirety. We cannot predict the outcome of any future legislation or litigation related to healthcare reform. Healthcare reform has resulted in profound changes to the individual health insurance market and our business, and we expect these changes to continue. 

Stark Law 

We are subject to federal and state &#8220;self-referral&#8221; laws. The Stark Law is a federal statute that prohibits physicians from referring patients for items covered by Medicare or Medicaid to entities with which the physician has a financial relationship, unless that relationship falls within a specified exception. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute and is violated even if the parties did not have an improper intent to induce physician referrals. The Stark Law is relevant to our business because we frequently organize arrangements of various kinds under which (a) physicians and hospitals jointly invest in and own ACOs, clinically integrated networks 

and other entities that engage in value-based contracting with third-party payers or (b) physicians are paid by hospitals or hospital affiliates for care management, medical or other services related to value-based contracts. We evaluate when these investment and compensation arrangements create financial relationships under the Stark Law and design structures that satisfy exceptions under the Stark Law or Medicare Shared Savings Program waiver. 

Anti-kickback Laws 

In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. The United States federal healthcare programs&#8217; Anti-Kickback Statute makes it unlawful for individuals or entities knowingly and willfully to solicit, offer, receive or pay any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute raises similar compliance issues as the Stark Law. While there are safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute, they differ from the Stark Law exceptions in that compliance with a safe harbor is not mandatory. If an arrangement falls outside the safe harbors, it must be evaluated on its specific facts to assess whether regulatory authorities might take the position that one purpose of the arrangement is to induce referrals of federal healthcare program business. Our business arrangements implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute for the same reasons they raise Stark Law issues. We evaluate whether investment and compensation arrangements being developed by us on behalf of hospital partners fall within one of the safe harbors or Medicare Shared Savings Program waiver. If not, we consider the factors that regulatory authorities are likely to consider in attempting to identify the intent behind such arrangements. We also design business models that reduce the risk that any such arrangements might be viewed as abusive and trigger Anti-Kickback Statute claims. 

Antitrust Laws 

The antitrust laws are designed to prevent competitors from jointly fixing prices. However, competitors often work collaboratively in order to reduce the cost of healthcare and improve quality. To balance these competing goals, antitrust enforcement agencies have established a regulatory framework under which claims of per se price fixing can be avoided if a network of competitors (such as an ACO or clinically integrated network) is financially or clinically integrated. In this context, we evaluate the tests for financial and clinical integration that would be applied to the provider networks that we are helping to create and support, including the nature and extent of any financial risk that must be assumed to be deemed financially integrated and the types of programs that must be implemented to achieve clinical integration. However, even if a network is integrated, it is still subject to a &#8220;rule of reason&#8221; test to determine whether its activities are, on balance, pro-competitive. The key factors in the rule of reason analysis are market share and exclusivity. We focus on network size, composition and contracting policies to strengthen our partners&#8217; position that their networks meet the rule of reason test. 

Federal Civil False Claims Act and State False Claims Laws 

The federal civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The &#8220;qui tam&#8221; or &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 

HIPAA, Privacy and Data Security Regulations 

By processing data on behalf of our partners, we are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including HIPAA, the HITECH Act and related state laws. We are also subject to federal and state security breach notification laws, as well as state laws regulating the processing of protected personal information, including laws governing the collection, use and disclosure of social security numbers and related identifiers. 

The regulations that implement HIPAA and the HITECH Act establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as &#8220;covered entities,&#8221; and their &#8220;business associates&#8221; (which includes anyone who performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the covered entity&#8217;s workforce). Our partners&#8217; health plans generally will be covered entities, and, as their business associate, they may ask us to contractually comply with certain aspects of these standards by entering into requisite business associate agreements. 

HIPAA Healthcare Fraud Standards 

The HIPAA healthcare fraud statute created a class of federal crimes known as the &#8220;federal healthcare offenses&#8221;, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The HIPAA healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, while the HIPAA false statements statute prohibits, among other things, concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Entities that are found to have aided or abetted in a violation of the HIPAA federal healthcare offenses are deemed by statute to have committed the offense and are punishable as a principal. 

Consumer Protection Laws 

Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the FTC, Federal Communications Commission and states&#8217; attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content and to regulate direct marketing, including telemarketing and telephonic communication. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. 

State Privacy Laws 

In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations, which we refer to as state privacy laws, that govern the use and disclosure of a person&#8217;s medical information or records and, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. These state privacy laws include regulation of health insurance providers and agents, regulation of organizations that perform certain administrative functions, such as UR, or TPA, issuance of notices of privacy practices and reporting and providing access to law enforcement authorities. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state privacy laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state privacy laws, we could be subject to additional sanctions. 

Other State Laws 

State insurance laws require licenses for certain health plan administrative activities, including TPA licenses for the processing, handling and adjudication of health insurance claims and UR agent licenses for providing medical management services. Given the nature and scope of services that we provide to certain partners, we are required to maintain TPA and UR agent licenses and ensure that such licenses are in good standing on an annual basis. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 946 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

Intellectual Property 

Our continued growth and success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, including the Identifi&#174; software platform. We primarily protect our intellectual property through a combination of copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights (including confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment-of-invention agreements with our with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business). 

However, these intellectual property rights and procedures may not prevent others from creating a competitive online platform or otherwise competing with us. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information related to our intellectual property position see &#8220;Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry.&#8221; 

Research and Development 

Our research and development expenditures primarily consist of our strategic investment in enhancing the functionality and usability of our software, Identifi&#174; and developing programs and processes to maximize care delivery efficiency and effectiveness. We also capitalize software development costs related to Identifi&#174;. We expensed $5.8 million, zero and $2.0 million in research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We capitalized $6.4 million, zero and zero of software development costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
