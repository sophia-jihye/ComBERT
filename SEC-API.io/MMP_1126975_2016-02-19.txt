See Part II&#8212;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 &#8211; Segment Disclosures . 

(c) Narrative Description of Business 

We are principally engaged in the transportation, storage and distribution of refined petroleum products and crude oil. As of December 31, 2015 , our asset portfolio, including the assets of our joint ventures, consisted of: 

&#8226; 

our refined products segment, comprised of our 9,500 -mile refined products pipeline system with 52 &#32;terminals as well as 28 &#32;independent terminals not connected to our pipeline system and our 1,100 -mile ammonia pipeline system; 

&#8226; 

our crude oil segment, comprised of approximately 1,700 &#32;miles of crude oil pipelines and storage facilities with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 22 &#32;million barrels, of which 14 &#32;million are used for leased storage; and 

&#8226; 

our marine storage segment, consisting of five &#32;marine terminals located along coastal waterways with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 26 &#32;million barrels. 

Industry Background 

The U.S. petroleum products transportation and distribution system links sources of crude oil supply with refineries and ultimately with end users of petroleum products. This system is comprised of a network of pipelines, terminals, storage facilities, waterborne vessels, railcars and trucks. For transportation of petroleum products, pipelines are generally the most reliable, lowest cost and safest alternative for intermediate and long-haul movements between different markets. Throughout the distribution system, terminals play a key role in facilitating product movements by providing storage, distribution, blending and other ancillary services. 

Terminology common in our industry includes the following terms, which describe products that we transport, store and distribute through our pipelines and terminals: 

&#8226; 

refined products &#32;are the output from refineries and are primarily used as fuels by consumers. Refined products include gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, kerosene and heating oil. Collectively, diesel fuel and heating oil are referred to as distillates; 

&#8226; 

liquefied petroleum gases or LPGs &#32;are produced as by-products of the crude oil refining process and in connection with natural gas production. LPGs include butane and propane; 

&#8226; 

blendstocks &#32;are blended with refined products to change or enhance their characteristics such as increasing a gasoline&#8217;s octane or oxygen content. Blendstocks include alkylates, oxygenates and natural gasoline; 

&#32;1 

&#8226; 

heavy oils and feedstocks &#32;are used as burner fuels or feedstocks for further processing by refineries and petrochemical facilities. Heavy oils and feedstocks include No. 6 fuel oil and vacuum gas oil; 

&#8226; 

crude oil and condensate &#32;are used as feedstocks by refineries and petrochemical facilities; 

&#8226; 

biofuels, &#32;such as ethanol and biodiesel, are increasingly required by government mandates; and 

&#8226; 

ammonia &#32;is primarily used as a nitrogen fertilizer. 

Except for ammonia, we use the term petroleum products &#32;to describe any, or a combination, of the above-noted products. 

Description of Our Businesses 

REFINED PRODUCTS 

Our refined products segment consists of our common carrier refined products pipeline system, independent terminals and our ammonia pipeline system. Our refined products pipeline system is the longest common carrier pipeline system for refined products and LPGs in the U.S., extending approximately 9,500 miles from the Gulf Coast and covering a 15-state area across the central U.S. The system includes approximately 42 million barrels of aggregate usable storage capacity at 52 connected terminals. Our network of independent terminals includes 28 refined products terminals with 6 million barrels of storage located primarily in the southeastern U.S. and connected to third-party common carrier interstate pipelines, including the Colonial and Plantation pipelines. Our 1,100-mile common carrier ammonia pipeline system extends from production facilities in Texas and Oklahoma to terminals in agricultural demand centers in the Midwest. 

Our refined products segment accounted for the following percentages of our consolidated revenue, operating margin and total assets:

Operations. Transportation, Terminalling and Ancillary Services. &#32;&#32; During 2015, 67% of the refined products segment's revenue (excluding product sales revenue) was generated from transportation tariffs on volumes shipped on our refined products pipeline system. These transportation tariffs vary depending upon where the product originates, where ultimate delivery occurs and any applicable discounts. All transportation rates and discounts are in published tariffs filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) or appropriate state agency. Included as part of these tariffs are charges for terminalling and storage of products at 32 of our pipeline system's 52 connected terminals. Revenue from terminalling and storage at the other 20 terminals on our refined products pipeline system is at privately negotiated rates. 

&#32;2 

In 2015, the products transported on our refined products pipeline system were comprised of 59% gasoline, 34% distillates and 7% aviation fuel and LPGs. The operating statistics below reflect our pipeline system&#8217;s operations for the periods indicated:

Our refined products pipeline system generates additional revenue from leasing pipeline and storage tank capacity to shippers and from providing services such as terminalling, ethanol and biodiesel unloading and loading, additive injection, custom blending, laboratory testing and data services to shippers, which are performed under a mix of &#8220;as needed,&#8221; monthly and long-term agreements. Furthermore, under our tariffs, we are allowed to deduct a prescribed quantity of the products our shippers transport, which is commonly referred to as "tender deductions," on our pipelines to compensate us for lost product during shipment due to metering inaccuracies, intermingling of products between batches (transmix), evaporation or other events that result in volume losses during the shipment process. In return for these tender deductions, our customers receive a guaranteed delivery of the gross volume of products they ship with us, less the amount of our tender deductions, irrespective of the actual amount of product losses we incur during the shipment process. 

Our independent terminals generate revenue primarily by charging fees based on the amount of product delivered through our facilities and from ancillary services such as additive injections and ethanol blending. Our ammonia pipeline system generates revenue primarily through transportation tariffs on volumes shipped. 

Substantially all of the transportation and throughput services we provide are for third parties, and we do not take title to those products. We do take title to products related to our butane blending and fractionation activities on our refined products pipeline system. We also take title for our tender deductions on our refined products pipeline systems. 

&#160; 

Commodity-Related Activities. &#32;Product sales revenue in our refined products segment primarily results from our butane blending and transmix fractionation activities, as well as from the sale of terminal product gains at our independent terminals. Our butane blending activity primarily involves purchasing butane and blending it into gasoline, which creates additional gasoline available for us to sell. This activity is limited by seasonal changes in gasoline vapor pressure specification requirements and by the varying quality of the gasoline products delivered to us. We typically hedge the economic margin from this blending activity by entering into either forward physical or New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") gasoline futures contracts at the time we purchase the related butane. These blending activities accounted for approximately 83% of the total product margin for the refined products segment during 2015. When the differential between the cost of butane and the price of gasoline is narrow, which generally occurs when crude oil prices are low, the product margin we earn from these activities is negatively impacted. We also operate three fractionators along our pipeline system that separate transmix, which is an unusable mixture of various refined products, into its original components. In addition to fractionating the transmix that results from our pipeline operations, we also purchase and fractionate transmix from third parties and sell the resulting separated refined products. 

Product margin from commodity-related activities in our refined products segment was $163.6 million, $279.7 million and $180.5 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2014 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. The amount of margin we earn from these activities fluctuates with changes in petroleum prices. Product margin is not a generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP") financial measure, but its components are determined in accordance with GAAP. Product margin, which is calculated as product sales revenue less cost of product sales, is used by 

&#32;3 

management to evaluate the profitability of our commodity-related activities. The components of product margin included in operating profit, the nearest GAAP measurement, is provided in Note 16&#8212; Segment Disclosures &#32;to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. 

Joint Venture Activities. &#32;&#32; We own a 50% interest in Powder Springs Logistics, LLC ("Powder Springs"), which was formed to construct and develop a butane blending system, including 120,000 barrels of butane storage, near Atlanta, Georgia. We serve as construction manager and will serve as operator of the Powder Springs facility. This facility is expected to be operational in early 2017. 

Markets and Competition . Shipments originate on our refined products pipeline system from direct connections to refineries, through interconnections with other interstate pipelines or at our terminals for transportation and ultimate distribution to retail gasoline stations, truck stops, railroads, airports and other end users. Through direct refinery connections and interconnections with other interstate pipelines, our refined products system can access approximately 48% of U.S. refining capacity, and in particular is well-connected to Gulf Coast and mid-continent refineries. Our system is dependent on the ability of refiners and marketers to meet the demand for those products in the markets they serve through their shipments on our pipeline system. According to April 2015 projections provided by the Energy Information Administration, which represent the latest long-term outlook at this point, the demand for refined products in the primary market areas served by our pipeline system, known as the West North Central and West South Central census districts, is expected to remain relatively stable over the next 10 years. As a result of its extensive connections to multiple refining regions, our pipeline system is well positioned to accommodate demand or supply shifts that may occur. 

In 2015, approximately 72% of the products transported on our refined products pipeline system originated from 19 direct refinery connections and 28% originated from connections with other pipelines or terminals. 

&#32;4 

As set forth in the table below, our system is directly connected to and receives product from the following 19 refineries:

In certain markets, barge, truck or rail provide an alternative source for transporting refined products; however, pipelines are generally the most reliable, lowest cost and safest alternative for refined products movements between different markets. As a result, our pipeline system's most significant competitors are other pipelines that serve the same markets. 

&#160; 

Competition with other pipeline systems is based primarily on transportation charges, quality of customer service, proximity to end users and longstanding customer relationships. However, given the different supply sources on each pipeline, pricing at either the origin or terminal point on a pipeline may outweigh transportation costs when customers choose which pipeline to use. 

&#160; 

Another form of competition for pipelines is the use of exchange agreements among shippers. Under these agreements, a shipper agrees to supply a market near its refinery or terminal in exchange for receiving supply from another refinery or terminal in a more distant market. These agreements allow the two parties to reduce the volumes transported and the transportation fees paid to us. We compete with these alternatives through price incentives and through long-term commercial arrangements with potential exchange partners. 

Government mandates increasingly require the use of renewable fuels, particularly ethanol. Due to technical and operational concerns, pipelines have generally not shipped ethanol, and most ethanol is transported by railroad, truck or barge. The increased use of ethanol has and will continue to compete with shipments on our pipeline system. However, most of our terminals have the necessary infrastructure to blend ethanol with refined products, and we earn revenue for these services. 

Our independent terminals receive product primarily from the interstate pipelines to which they are connected and serve the retail, industrial and commercial sales markets along those pipelines. Demand for our services is driven primarily by end user demand in those markets. Our terminals compete with other independent terminal 

&#32;6 

operators as well as integrated oil companies on the basis of terminal location and versatility, services provided and price. 

Our ammonia pipeline system receives product from ammonia production facilities in Texas and Oklahoma and delivers to agricultural markets in the Midwest, where the ammonia is used by farmers as a nitrogen fertilizer. Our system competes primarily with ammonia shipped by rail carriers, and in certain markets with a third-party ammonia pipeline. 

Customers and Contracts. Our refined products pipeline system ships products for several different types of customers, including independent and integrated oil companies, wholesalers, retailers, traders, railroads, airlines and regional farm cooperatives. End markets for refined products deliveries are primarily retail gasoline stations, truck stops, farm cooperatives, railroad fueling depots and military and commercial jet fuel users. LPG shippers include wholesalers and retailers that, in turn, sell to commercial, industrial, agricultural and residential heating customers, as well as utilities who use propane as a fuel source. Published tariffs serve as contracts and shippers nominate the volume to be shipped up to a month in advance. In addition, we enter into agreements with shippers that commonly result in payment, volume or term commitments in exchange for reduced tariff rates or capital expansion commitments on our part. For 2015, approximately 42% of the shipments on our pipeline system were subject to these agreements. The average remaining life of these contracts was approximately four years as of December 31, 2015, with remaining terms of up to 13 years. While many of these agreements do not represent guaranteed volumes, they do reflect a significant level of shipper commitment to our refined products pipeline system. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our refined products pipeline system had approximately 60 transportation customers. The top 10 shippers included independent refining companies, integrated oil companies and farm cooperatives. Revenue attributable to these top 10 shippers for the year ended December 31, 2015 represented 46% of total revenue for our refined products segment and 54% of revenue excluding product sales. 

&#160; 

Customers of our independent terminals include independent and integrated oil companies, retailers, wholesalers and traders. Contracts vary in term and commitment and typically renew automatically at the end of the contract period. 

Our ammonia pipeline system ships product for three customers who own production facilities connected to our system. We have rolling three-year agreements with these customers that contain minimum volume commitments whereby a customer must pay for unused pipeline capacity if the customer fails to ship its committed volume. 

Product sales are primarily to trading and marketing or other companies active in the markets we serve. These sales agreements are generally short-term in nature. 

CRUDE OIL 

Our crude oil segment is comprised of approximately 1,700 miles of crude oil pipelines with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 22 million barrels of storage, of which 14 million are used for leased storage, including: (i) the Longhorn crude oil pipeline; (ii) our Cushing, Oklahoma storage terminal; (iii) the Houston-area crude oil distribution system; (iv) the crude oil components of our East Houston, Texas terminal; (v) the crude oil components of our Corpus Christi, Texas terminal; (vi) the Gibson, Louisiana terminal; and (vii) the assets owned by our BridgeTex Pipeline Company, LLC ("BridgeTex"), Double Eagle Pipeline LLC (&#8220;Double Eagle&#8221;), Osage Pipe Line Company, LLC (&#8220;Osage&#8221;), Saddlehorn Pipeline Company, LLC ("Saddlehorn") and Seabrook Logistics, LLC ("Seabrook") joint ventures.

Operations. &#32; &#32;Our crude oil assets are strategically located to serve crude oil supply, trading and demand centers. Revenue is generated primarily through transportation tariffs, which includes tender deductions, paid by shippers on our crude oil pipelines and storage fees paid by our crude oil terminal customers. In addition, we earn revenue for ancillary services including throughput fees. We generally do not take title to the products we ship or store for our crude oil customers. We do own certain tank bottom assets at our crude oil terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma that are not sold in the normal course of business and are classified as long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we are allowed under our tariffs to take tender deductions to compensate us for lost product during shipment due to metering inaccuracies, evaporation or other events that result in volume losses during the shipment process. We take title to the petroleum products we obtain under our tender deductions on our crude oil pipeline systems. 

The approximately 450-mile Longhorn crude oil pipeline has the capacity to transport up to 275,000 barrels of crude oil per day from the Permian Basin in West Texas to Houston, Texas. Shipments originate on the Longhorn pipeline in Crane, Barnhart or Midland, Texas via trucks or interconnections with crude oil gathering systems owned by third parties and are delivered to our terminal at East Houston or to various points on the Houston Ship Channel, including multiple refineries connected to our Houston-area crude oil distribution system that terminates in Texas City, Texas. 

Our East Houston terminal includes approximately six million barrels of crude oil storage, with approximately three million barrels used for leased storage and three million barrels dedicated to the operation of the Longhorn and BridgeTex pipelines, which deliver crude oil to our East Houston terminal. (See discussion of our BridgeTex joint venture under Joint Venture Activities &#32;below.) Our East Houston terminal is also connected to our Houston-area crude oil distribution system and to third-party pipelines, including the Houston-to-Houma pipeline. We are building additional storage at this location to facilitate movements on our pipeline systems or lease to customers. 

Our Houston-area crude oil distribution system consists of more than 100 miles of pipeline segments that connect our East Houston terminal through several interchanges to various points, including multiple refineries throughout the Houston area and Texas City, Texas. In addition, it is directly connected to other third-party crude oil pipelines providing us access to crude oil from the Eagle Ford shale, the strategic crude oil hub in Cushing, Oklahoma and crude oil imports. In November 2014, we expanded our Houston-area crude oil distribution system by acquiring a 40-mile crude oil pipeline in the Houston Gulf Coast area. 

Our Cushing terminal consists of approximately 12 million barrels of crude oil storage, of which two million barrels are reserved for working inventory, leaving 10 million barrels that we can lease. The facility primarily receives and distributes crude oil via the multiple common carrier pipelines that terminate in and originate from the Cushing crude oil trading hub, as well as short-haul pipeline connections with neighboring crude oil terminals. 

We own approximately 400 miles of pipeline in Kansas and Oklahoma currently used for crude oil service. A portion of these pipelines are leased to third parties, and we earn revenue from these pipeline segments for capacity reserved even if not used by the customers. 

&#32;8 

Our Corpus Christi, Texas terminal includes approximately two million barrels of condensate storage, with a portion used for leased storage and a portion used in conjunction with our Double Eagle joint venture discussed below. These assets receive product primarily from trucks, barges and pipelines that connect to our terminal for further distribution to end users by pipeline or waterborne vessels. 

Joint Venture Activities. &#32;&#32; We own a 50% interest in BridgeTex, a joint venture with an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. ("Plains"). BridgeTex owns an approximately 400-mile pipeline capable of transporting up to 300,000 barrels per day of Permian Basin crude oil from Colorado City, Texas to our East Houston terminal as well as operational crude oil storage at Colorado City of approximately one million barrels. The BridgeTex pipeline began operations in September 2014. We received construction fees and continue to receive operational management fees from BridgeTex, which we report as affiliate management fee revenue on our consolidated statements of income. We entered into a long-term lease agreement with BridgeTex for capacity on our Houston area crude oil distribution system and receive capacity lease revenue from this agreement, which is included in transportation and terminals revenue on our consolidated statements of income. 

We own a 50% interest in Double Eagle, a joint venture with an affiliate of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. ("Kinder"), that transports condensate from the Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas via an approximately 200-mile pipeline to our terminal in Corpus Christi or to an inter-connecting pipeline that transports product to the Houston, Texas area. An affiliate of Kinder serves as the operator of Double Eagle. We receive throughput revenue from Double Eagle that is included in our transportation and terminals revenue on our consolidated statements of income. 

We own a 50% interest in Osage, which owns an approximately 135-mile pipeline that transports crude oil from Cushing to two refineries in Kansas. We receive a management fee for serving as the operator of Osage. 

We own a 40% interest in Saddlehorn, a joint venture with an affiliate of Plains (40% interest) and an affiliate of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation ("Anadarko") (20% interest). Saddlehorn owns an undivided joint interest in an approximately 600-mile pipeline which will deliver various grades of crude oil from the DJ Basin, and potentially the broader Rocky Mountain production area, to Cushing, Oklahoma. Saddlehorn's undivided joint interest entitles it to a capacity of approximately 190,000 barrels per day. We serve as construction manager and will serve as operator of the Saddlehorn system once operations commence. The Saddlehorn pipeline is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2016. 

We own a 50% interest in Seabrook, a joint venture with LBC Tank Terminals, LLC ("LBC"). Seabrook was formed in second quarter 2015 to construct, own and operate crude oil storage and pipeline infrastructure in the Houston Gulf Coast area. The assets to be constructed and owned by Seabrook include over 700,000 barrels of crude oil storage located adjacent to LBC's existing terminal in Seabrook, Texas and a pipeline that will connect Seabrook's storage facilities to an existing third-party pipeline that will transport crude oil to a Houston-area refinery. Subject to the receipt of permits and regulatory approvals, the new storage facility and pipeline infrastructure are expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2017. 

Markets and Competition. &#32;&#32;Market conditions experienced by our crude oil pipelines vary significantly by location. Our Longhorn and BridgeTex pipelines deliver Permian Basin production to trading and demand centers in the Houston area, and consequently depend on the level of production in the Permian Basin for supply. Demand for shipments to the Houston area is driven primarily by the utilization of West Texas crude oil by Gulf Coast refineries and the price for crude oil on the Gulf Coast relative to its price in alternative markets. Permian Basin production may vary based on numerous factors including overall crude oil prices and changes in costs of production, while Gulf Coast refinery demand for Permian Basin production may change based on relative prices for competing crude oil or changes by refineries to their crude oil processing slates, as well as by overall domestic and international demand for refined products. Our Longhorn and BridgeTex pipelines compete with alternative outlets for Permian Basin production, including pipelines that transport crude oil to the Cushing crude oil trading hub as well as other pipelines that currently transport or new pipelines that may transport Permian Basin crude to the Gulf Coast. These pipelines also compete with truck and rail alternatives for Permian Basin barrels. Indirectly, these pipelines also 

&#32;9 

compete with other alternatives for delivering similar quality crude oil to the Gulf Coast, including pipelines from other producing basins such as the Eagle Ford shale or Gulf of Mexico, as well as waterborne imports. Competition is based primarily on tariff rates, proximity to both supply and demand centers, connectivity and customer relationships. 

Volumes on our Houston-area crude oil distribution system are driven by our customers' demand for distribution of crude oil between our system's various connections and as a result are affected in part by changes in origins and destinations of crude oil processed in or distributed through the Gulf Coast region. Our system competes with other distribution facilities in the Houston area based primarily on tariff rates and connectivity. 

Our crude oil storage facilities in Cushing serve customers who value Cushing's location as an interchange point for numerous interstate pipelines and its status as a crude oil trading hub. Demand for crude oil storage in Cushing could be affected by changes in crude oil pipeline flows that change the volume of crude oil that flows through or is stored in Cushing, as well as by developments of alternative trading hubs that reduce Cushing's relative importance. In addition, demand for our storage services in Cushing could be affected by crude oil price volatility or price structures or by regulatory or financial conditions that affect the ability of our customers to store or trade crude oil. We compete in Cushing with numerous other storage providers, with competition based on a combination of connectivity, storage rates and other terms, customer service and customer relationships. 

The Double Eagle pipeline depends on condensate production from the Eagle Ford shale formation for its supply and competes with other pipelines that are capable of transporting condensate from the Eagle Ford production area. Competition is based primarily on tariff rates, delivery mode and customer service. The demand for Double Eagle's services could be affected by changes in Eagle Ford condensate production or changes in demand for different grades of condensate. Demand for our condensate storage at Corpus Christi is subject to similar market conditions and competitive forces. 

Customers and Contracts. &#32;&#32;We ship crude oil as a common carrier for several different types of customers, including crude oil producers, end users such as refiners, and marketing and trading companies. Published transportation tariffs filed with the FERC or the appropriate state agency serve as contracts to ship on our crude oil pipelines, and shippers nominate volumes to be transported up to a month in advance, with rates varying by origin and destination. In addition, tariff rates can vary with the volume of spot barrel movements on our pipelines, which generally ship at higher rates than those charged to committed shippers. Based on generally accepted practices, we reserve 10% of the shipping capacity of our pipelines for spot shippers. Generally, we have secured long-term agreements to support our long-haul crude oil pipeline assets. Specifically with regard to our Longhorn pipeline, the vast majority of the volumes shipped on that system are supported by long-term take-or-pay customer agreements. For 2015, approximately 45% of the shipments on our wholly-owned crude oil pipelines were subject to long-term agreements. The average remaining life of these contracts was approximately three years as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, 60% of our crude oil leased storage capacity was under contracts with terms in excess of one year, with an average remaining life of approximately two years. These contracts obligate the customer to pay for storage capacity reserved even if not used by the customer. Double Eagle and BridgeTex also have long-term contracts which support the capital investments in these pipeline systems. 

MARINE STORAGE 

We own and operate five marine storage terminals located along coastal waterways with approximately 25 million barrels of aggregate storage capacity and approximately one million additional barrels of storage jointly owned through our Texas Frontera, LLC joint venture ("Texas Frontera"). Our marine terminals provide distribution, storage, blending, inventory management and additive injection services for refiners, marketers, traders and other end users of petroleum products.

See Note 16&#8211; Segment Disclosures &#32;in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional financial information about our marine storage segment. 

&#32; Operations. Our marine storage terminals generate revenue primarily through providing long-term storage services for a variety of customers. Refiners and chemical companies typically use our storage terminals due to tankage constraints at their facilities or the specialized handling requirements of the stored product. We also provide storage services to marketers and traders that require access to large storage capacity. Because the rates charged at these terminals are unregulated, the marketplace determines the prices we charge for our services. In general, we do not take title to the products that are stored in or distributed from our marine terminals. 

&#160; 

Our Galena Park, Texas marine terminal is located along the Houston Ship Channel and is our largest marine facility with 13 million barrels of wholly-owned usable storage capacity. This facility currently stores a mix of refined products, blendstocks, heavy oils and crude oil. This facility receives and distributes products by pipeline, truck, rail, barge and ship. An advantage of our Galena Park facility is that it provides our customers with access to multiple common carrier pipelines, deep-water port facilities that accommodate both ship and barge traffic and loading and unloading facilities for trucks and rail cars. 

Our New Haven, Connecticut marine terminal is located on the Long Island Sound near the New York Harbor and has approximately four million barrels of usable storage capacity and primarily handles heating oil, refined products, asphalt, ethanol and biodiesel. This facility receives and distributes products by pipeline, ship, barge and truck. 

Our Marrero, Louisiana marine terminal is located on the Mississippi River and has approximately three million barrels of usable storage capacity. This facility primarily handles heavy oils, distillates and asphalt. We receive products at our Marrero terminal by ship and barge and deliver products from Marrero by rail, ship, barge and truck. 

Our Wilmington, Delaware marine terminal is located at the Port of Wilmington along the Delaware River. The facility includes almost three million barrels of usable storage and primarily handles refined products, ethanol, heavy oils and crude oil. We receive products at our Wilmington terminal by ship and barge and deliver products from this facility by truck, ship and barge. 

Our Corpus Christi, Texas marine terminal is located near local refineries and petrochemical plants and includes almost two million barrels of usable storage capacity utilized for heavy oils and feedstocks. We receive and deliver products at our Corpus Christi facility primarily by ship, barge, truck and pipeline. 

Joint Venture Activities . We own a 50% interest in Texas Frontera, which owns approximately one million additional barrels of storage at our Galena Park terminal. This storage is leased under a long-term agreement with an affiliate of Texas Frontera. In addition to our portion of the net earnings of the joint venture, which we recognize as earnings of non-controlled entities, we receive a fee for operating the storage tanks of Texas Frontera, which we recognize as affiliate management fee revenue. 

Markets and Competition. &#32;Our marine storage terminals compete with other independent terminals with respect to location, price, versatility and services provided. The competition primarily comes from integrated 

&#32;11 

petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies, independent terminal companies and distribution companies with marketing and trading operations. Similar to pipelines carrying petroleum products, the high capital costs deter competitors from building new storage facilities. 

We believe the continued strong demand for storage and ancillary services at our marine terminals results from our cost-effective distribution services and key transportation links, which provide us with a stable base of storage fee revenue. The ancillary services we provide at our marine terminals, such as product heating, blending, mixing and additive injection, attract additional demand for our storage services and result in additional revenue opportunities. Demand can be influenced by projected changes in and volatility of petroleum product prices. 

Customers and Contracts. We have long-standing relationships with refineries, suppliers and traders at our marine terminals. During 2015, approximately 96% of our storage terminal capacity was utilized with the remaining 4% not utilized primarily due to tank integrity work throughout the year. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 80% of our usable storage capacity was under contracts with remaining terms in excess of one year or that renew on an annual basis at our customers' option. The average remaining life of our storage contracts was approximately three years as of December 31, 2015. These contracts obligate the customer to pay for terminal capacity reserved even if not used by the customer. 

&#160; 

GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION 

Major Customers 

Major Customers. &#32;One customer accounted for 8% , 12% &#32;and 6% &#32;of our consolidated total revenue in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% &#32;of our consolidated revenues during these years. The majority of revenue from this customer resulted from sale of refined products that were generated in connection with our butane blending and fractionation activities, which are activities conducted by our refined products segment. We believe that other companies would purchase the petroleum products from us if this customer were unable or unwilling to do so. 

&#160; 

Commodity Positions and Hedges 

Commodity Positions and Hedges. Our policy is generally to purchase only those products necessary to conduct our normal business activities. We do not acquire physical inventory, futures contracts or other derivative instruments for the purpose of speculating on commodity price changes. Our butane blending and fractionation activities result in us carrying significant levels of petroleum product inventories. In addition, we hold positions related to our refined and crude pipeline systems' product gains and losses, crude tank bottoms and other crude inventories. We use derivative instruments to hedge against commodity price changes and manage risks associated with our various commodity purchase and sale obligations. Our strategies are primarily intended to mitigate and manage price risks that are inherent in our commodity positions. Our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor our derivative instrument positions, as well as physical volumes, grades, locations, delivery schedules and storage capacity to help ensure that our hedging activities address our risks. 

Regulation 

Interstate Tariff Regulation. Our refined products pipeline system's interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and rules and orders promulgated pursuant thereto. FERC regulation requires that interstate pipeline rates, including rates for all petroleum products, be filed with the FERC and posted publicly and that these rates be nondiscriminatory and &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; when taking into account our cost of service. The rates of our interstate pipeline, which include approximately 40% of the shipments on our refined products pipeline system, are regulated by the FERC primarily through an index methodology, which for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016 will be set at the annual change in the producer price index for finished goods (&#8220;PPI-FG&#8221;) plus 1.23%. In general, we are permitted to adjust our rates to the ceiling established by the PPI-FG index plus 1.23%. Rate changes and the overall level of our rates may be subject to challenge by the FERC or shippers. If the FERC determines that our 

&#32;12 

rates are not just and reasonable, we may be required to reduce our rates and pay refunds for up to two years of over-earning. As an alternative to cost-of-service based rates, interstate pipeline companies may establish rates by obtaining authority to charge market-based rates in competitive markets or by agreement with unaffiliated shippers. Approximately 60% of our refined products pipeline system's markets are either subject to regulations by the states in which we operate, or are deemed competitive by the FERC, in which case these rates can be adjusted at our discretion based on competitive factors. 

&#160; 

The Surface Transportation Board, a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation, has jurisdiction over interstate pipeline transportation and rate regulations of ammonia. Transportation rates must be reasonable, and a pipeline carrier may not unreasonably discriminate among its shippers. 

&#160; 

Intrastate Tariff Regulation. Some shipments on our refined products and ammonia pipeline systems, and substantially all shipments on our wholly-owned crude oil pipelines, move within a single state and thus are considered to be intrastate commerce. Our pipelines are subject to certain regulations with respect to such intrastate transportation by state regulatory authorities in the states of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. 

&#160; 

Commodity Market Regulation. Our conduct in petroleum markets and in hedging our exposure to commodity price fluctuations must comply with laws and regulations that prohibit market manipulation. 

Wholesale sales of petroleum are subject to provisions of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (&#8220;EISA&#8221;) and regulations by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"). Under the EISA, the FTC issued a rule that prohibits fraudulent or deceptive conduct (including false or misleading statements of material fact) in connection with wholesale purchases or sales of crude oil or refined products. The FTC rule also bans intentional failures to state a material fact when the omission makes a statement misleading and distorts, or is likely to distort, market conditions for any product covered by the rule. The FTC holds substantial enforcement authority under the EISA, including authority to request that a court impose fines of up to $1 million per day per violation. 

&#160; 

Under the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") is directed to prevent price manipulations for the commodities markets, including the physical energy, futures and swaps markets. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has adopted additional anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit, among other things, fraud and price manipulation in the physical energy, futures and swaps markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to assess fines of up to the greater of $1 million or triple the monetary gain for violations of its anti-market manipulation regulations. 

Should we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to material penalties, changes in the rates we can charge and liability to third parties. 

Renewable Fuel Standard. &#160; We are an obligated party under the Environmental Protection Agency's ("EPA") Renewable Fuel Standard ("RFS") and are required to satisfy our Renewable Volume Obligation ("RVO") on an annual basis. To meet the RVO, the gasoline products we produce in our butane blending activities must either contain the mandated renewable fuel components, or credits must be purchased to cover any shortfall. We met our RVO requirements for 2015 and expect to satisfy the requirements for 2016 mainly through the purchase of credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers ("RINs"). As the RFS program is currently structured, the RVO of all obligated parties will increase annually unless adjusted by the EPA. The ability to incorporate increasing volumes of renewable fuel components into fuel products may be limited and could present challenges, which could increase our cost to comply with the RFS standards. 

&#32;13 

Environmental, Maintenance, Safety &#38; Security 

General. The operation of our pipeline systems, terminals and associated facilities is subject to strict and complex laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and workplace safety. These bodies of laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business including the work environment, the generation and disposal of waste, discharge of process and storm water, air emissions, remediation requirements and facility design requirements to protect against releases into the environment. We believe our assets are designed, operated and maintained in material compliance with these laws and regulations and in accordance with other generally accepted industry standards and practices. 

Environmental. &#32;&#32;Our estimates for remediation costs assume that we will be able to use traditionally acceptable remedial and monitoring methods, as well as associated engineering or institutional controls, to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. These estimates include the cost of performing environmental assessments, remediation and monitoring of the impacted environment such as soils, groundwater and surface water conditions. Our recorded remediation costs are estimates and total remediation costs may differ from current estimated amounts. 

We may experience future releases of regulated materials into the environment or discover historical releases that were previously unidentified or not assessed. While an asset integrity and maintenance program designed to prevent, promptly detect and address releases is an integral part of our operations, damages and liabilities arising out of any environmental release from our assets identified in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. 

Environmental Liabilities. &#32;&#32; Liabilities recognized for estimated environmental costs were $36.3 million &#32;and $31.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. Environmental liabilities have been classified as current or noncurrent based on management's estimates regarding the timing of actual payments. Management estimates that expenditures associated with these environmental liabilities will be substantially paid over the next 9 years. 

Environmental Receivables . &#32;&#32;Receivables from insurance carriers related to environmental matters were $5.1 million &#32;and $2.6 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. 

Environmental Insurance Policies. We have insurance policies that provide coverage for environmental matters associated with liabilities arising from sudden and accidental releases of products applicable to all of our assets. 

Hazardous Substances and Wastes. In most instances, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into water or soils, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended ("CERCLA"), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. 

Our operations generate wastes, including hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes. We are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the RCRA requirements as our operations routinely generate only small quantities of hazardous wastes, and we are not a hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facility operator that is required to obtain a RCRA hazardous waste permit. While RCRA currently exempts a number of wastes from being subject to hazardous waste requirements, including many oil and gas exploration and production wastes, the EPA could consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Moreover, it is possible that additional wastes, which could include non-hazardous wastes currently generated during operations, may be designated as hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly storage and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes. Changes in the regulations could materially increase our expenses. 

&#32;14 

We own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties were previously operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators, to remediate contaminated property, including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators, or to make capital improvements to prevent future contamination. 

As part of our assessment of facility operations, we have identified some above-ground tanks at our terminals that either are or are suspected of being coated with lead-based paints. The removal and disposal of any paints that are found to be lead-based, whenever such activities are conducted in the future as part of our day-to-day maintenance activities, will require increased handling. However, we do not expect the costs associated with this increased handling to be material. 

Water Discharges. Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and refined products, and are subject to the Oil Pollution Act ("OPA") and Clean Water Act ("CWA"). The OPA and CWA subject owners of facilities to strict, joint and potentially significant liability for removal costs and certain other consequences of a product spill such as natural resource damages, where the product spills into regulated waters, along federal shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the U.S. In the event of a product spill from one of our facilities into regulated waters, substantial liabilities could be imposed. States in which we operate have also enacted similar laws. The CWA imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. This law and comparable state laws require that permits be obtained to discharge pollutants into regulated waters and impose substantial potential liability for non-compliance. Compliance with these laws is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operation or cash flows. 

Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) and comparable state and local laws and regulations, which regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including certain of our facilities, and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. We believe, however, that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements. 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that require certain large stationary sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for GHG emissions, which does currently apply to our facilities. In addition, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain large greenhouse gas emissions sources. This reporting rule was expanded in November 2010 to include petroleum facilities. We have adopted procedures for future required reporting. 

While Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is perceived to be low at this time. Nevertheless, the current administration has announced it intends to adopt additional regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to encourage greater use of low carbon technologies. Several states have implemented programs to reduce or monitor greenhouse gas emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of greenhouse gases could adversely affect 

&#32;15 

demand for the oil that exploration and production operators produce, including our current or future customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services. 

&#160; 

In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil industry, it could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business. 

The effect on our operations of legislative and regulatory efforts to regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas that we conduct business could adversely affect the demand for the products that we transport, store and distribute and, depending on the particular program adopted, could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities by requiring that we measure and report our emissions, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay any taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program, among other things. We may be unable to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged to our customers and any such recovery may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or implementing regulations. 

Finally, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. 

Maintenance. Our pipeline systems are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended ("HLPSA"), and comparable state statutes relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of our pipeline facilities. HLPSA covers crude oil, refined products and anhydrous ammonia and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, permit access to and copying of records and make certain reports and provide information as required by the Department of Transportation. Our assets are also subject to various federal security regulations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations. 

&#160; 

The Department of Transportation requires operators of hazardous liquid interstate pipelines to develop and follow an integrity management program that provides for assessment of the integrity of all pipeline segments that could affect designated &#8220;high consequence areas,&#8221; including high population areas, drinking water, commercially navigable waterways and ecologically sensitive resource areas. Segments of our pipeline systems have the potential to impact high consequence areas. In addition to regulations applicable to all of our pipelines, we have undertaken additional obligations to mitigate potential risks to health, safety and the environment on our Longhorn pipeline. Our compliance with these incremental obligations is subject to the oversight of the Department of Transportation through PHMSA. 

Our marine terminals along coastal waterways are subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations and comparable state statutes relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of these assets. 

Breakout Storage Tank Integrity Regulations. &#32; PHMSA defines a breakout tank as one that is used to relieve surges in a hazardous liquid pipeline system or to receive and store hazardous liquids transported by a pipeline for reinjection and continued transportation by a pipeline. In January 2015, amended regulations were published by PHMSA which require more frequent out-of-service inspections for breakout storage tanks. These regulations would impact approximately 550 of our storage tanks. We remain in active discussions with PHMSA to consider alternative, technically-viable inspection intervals. If we are unable to reach such an agreement with PHMSA, our compliance with the amended regulations could negatively impact our future financial results and could result in service disruptions to our customers. 

&#160; 

&#32;16 

Safety. Our assets are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes, which, among other things, require us to organize and disclose information about the hazardous materials used in our operations. Certain parts of this information must be reported to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens upon request. At qualifying facilities, we are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations that are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. Compliance with these laws is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. 

The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly-constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. PHMSA has also published notices and advanced notices of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments on the need for changes to its safety regulations, including whether to revise the integrity management requirements. Legislation to reauthorize previous pipeline safety programs is being prepared and will likely include additional provisions designed to enhance pipeline safety. Compliance with such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Title to Properties 

Substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of the property, and in some instances, these rights-of-way have limited terms that may require periodic renegotiation or, if such negotiations are unsuccessful, may require us to seek to exercise the power of eminent domain. Several rights-of-way for our pipelines and other real property assets are shared with other pipelines and by third parties. In many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens, which have not been subordinated to the rights-of-way grants. We have obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, water courses, county roads, municipal streets and state highways, and in some instances, these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor. We have also obtained permits from railroad companies to cross over or under lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor's election. In some cases, property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee. In some states and under some circumstances, we have the right of eminent domain to acquire rights-of-way and land necessary for our pipelines. 

Some of the leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses that have been transferred to us are only transferable with the consent of the grantor of these rights, which in some instances is a governmental entity. We believe that we have obtained or will obtain sufficient third-party consents, permits and authorizations to operate our business in all material respects. 

We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, liens that can be imposed in some jurisdictions for government-initiated action to clean up environmental contamination, liens for current taxes and other burdens, and easements, restrictions and other encumbrances to which the underlying properties were subject at the time of acquisition by us or our predecessor, we believe that none of these burdens should materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest in them or should materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,640 &#32;employees, 903 &#32;of which were assigned to our refined products segment and concentrated in the central U.S. Approximately 25% &#32;of the 903 &#32;employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (&#8220;USW&#8221;) and are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires January 31, 2019. At December 31, 2015 , 98 &#32;of our employees were assigned to our crude oil segment and were concentrated in the central U.S., and none &#32;of these employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The labor force of 170 &#32;employees assigned to our marine storage segment at December 31, 2015 &#32;was primarily located in the Gulf and East Coast regions of the U.S. Approximately 16% &#32;of these employees were represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers (&#8220;IUOE&#8221;) and covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires October 31, 2016.
