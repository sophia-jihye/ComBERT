 Item 1. Business. Corporate Overview 

First Community Bancshares, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), a financial holding company, was founded in 1989 and incorporated under the laws of Nevada in 1997. The Company provides commercial banking products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;), a Virginia-chartered banking institution founded in 1874. The Bank operates under the trade names First Community Bank in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina and People&#146;s Community Bank, a Division of First Community Bank, in Tennessee. Unless the context suggests otherwise, the terms &#147;First Community,&#148; &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; and &#147;us&#148; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to First Community Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity. Our operations are guided by a strategic plan focusing on organic growth that may be supplemented by strategic acquisitions. 

The Company provides insurance services through its wholly owned, full-service insurance agency subsidiary Greenpoint Insurance Group, Inc. (&#147;Greenpoint&#148;). Greenpoint operates under the Greenpoint name and under the trade name First Community Insurance Services (&#147;FCIS&#148;) in North Carolina, Carr &#38; Hyde Insurance and FCIS in Virginia, and FCIS in West Virginia. 

The Bank offers wealth management and investment advice through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Wealth Management and the Bank&#146;s Trust Division. The Company is the common stockholder of FCBI Capital Trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;), which was created in October 2003 to issue trust preferred securities to raise capital for the Company. 

The Company is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its affiliates. As a financial holding company, the Company is required to act as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary bank. The Company&#146;s principal source of revenue is derived from dividends paid by the Bank, which are subject to certain restrictions by regulatory agencies and determined in relation to earnings, asset growth, and capital position. For additional information see &#147;Regulation and Supervision&#148; below. 

Operations 

We operate in one business segment: Community Banking. The Community Banking segment consists of commercial and consumer banking, lending activities, wealth management, and insurance services. Our principal executive office is located at One Community Place, Bluefield, Virginia. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 58 locations in 4 states: Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. We serve a diverse base of individuals and businesses across a variety of industries, such as manufacturing, construction, retail, healthcare, military, and transportation. We have no material concentrations of deposits or loans related to any single customer or industry. See Item 6, &#147;Selected Financial Data,&#148; in Part II of this report for a summary of our financial performance. 

We offer a wide range of services and products to our customers: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; demand deposit accounts, savings and money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and individual retirement arrangements; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; commercial, consumer, and real estate mortgage loans, and lines of credit;

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 673 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by collective bargaining agreements and we consider employee relations to be excellent. 

Competition 

The financial services industry is highly competitive and there is substantial competition in attracting deposit and loan relationships in our market areas. The ability of non-bank financial entities to provide services previously reserved for commercial banks has intensified competition. We compete with other commercial banks and financial service providers, including thrifts, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, securities firms, brokerage firms, and insurance companies. Competition for deposits generally comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, mutual funds, and other investment alternatives. Factors that influence our ability to attract and retain deposits include interest rates, personalized services, quality and variety of financial offerings, convenience of office locations, automated services, and office hours. Competition for commercial and business loans generally comes from other commercial banks and commercial finance and leasing companies, while competition for mortgage loans primarily comes from other commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, mortgage brokers, and insurance companies. Factors that influence our ability to originate loans include interest rates, loan origination fees, quality and variety of lending offerings, and personalized services. Our competitors may have greater resources and higher lending limits that allow them to offer services we do not provide. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of general and local economic conditions, industry consolidation, bank failures, technological developments, and banking regulatory reform. See &#147;Competition&#148; in the &#147;Executive Overview&#148; section in Part II, Item 7 of this report.

Regulation and Supervision 

Banks and financial holding companies operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation under applicable federal and state laws and various regulatory agencies. The regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;), and the banking system as a whole and are 

&#160; 

generally not for the protection of stockholders or creditors. Banking agencies have broad enforcement powers over banks and financial holding companies to impose substantial fines and penalties for violations of laws and regulations. 

The following discussion summarizes certain laws, rules, and regulations that affect our Company. These summaries are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable statute or regulation. A change in laws, rules, and regulations may have a material effect on our Company. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;) of 2010 implemented far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape in the U.S, including the following provisions: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; centralizes responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;), responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; requires financial holding companies, such as the Company, to be well capitalized and well managed as of July 21, 2011 (bank holding companies and banks must also be well capitalized and well managed to engage in interstate bank acquisitions); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; imposes comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institutions themselves; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; implements corporate governance revisions, including executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; makes permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; repeals the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to, among other things, give the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#147;Federal Reserve&#148;) the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and enforces a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; increases the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine bank holding companies, such as the Company, and their non-bank subsidiaries. 

First Community Bancshares, Inc. 

The Company is a financial holding company organized under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#147;GLB Act&#148;) and a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#147;BHC Act&#148;). The Company is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The GLB Act, BHC Act, and other federal laws subject financial and bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities they may engage in and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. The BHC Act generally provides for umbrella regulation of financial holding companies, such as the Company, by the Federal Reserve, as well as functional regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by insurance regulators. 

The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act as administered by the SEC. The 

&#160; 

Company&#146;s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol &#147;FCBC&#148; and is subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies. 

Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends: Source of Strength 

The Federal Reserve&#146;s policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, even when it may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Federal Reserve policy states that bank holding companies may pay cash dividends on common stock only from income available over the past year if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#146;s expected future needs and financial condition. Bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries. A bank holding company may be required to guarantee the capital restoration plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary in certain situations. 

In addition, the Company and the Bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal regulatory authority may determine that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice, under certain circumstances regarding the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank, and prohibit dividend payments. The appropriate federal regulatory authorities have stated that paying dividends that deplete a bank&#146;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels, unless both asset quality and capital are very strong, and has noted that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy. 

Scope of Permissible Activities 

Under the BHC Act, bank holding companies are limited to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for their subsidiaries, or other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank or all, or substantially all, of the assets of a bank. When approving bank acquisitions by bank holding companies, the Federal Reserve is required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding company and the target bank, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and various competitive factors. The BHC Act also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any company engaged in a non-banking business unless such business is determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the GLB Act eliminated the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial service providers and permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature. The GLB Act defines &#147;financial in nature&#148; to include securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. Regulatory approval is not generally required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature, or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve. 

Under the GLB Act, a bank holding company may become a financial holding company by filing a declaration with the Federal Reserve if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the FDIC Improvement Act 

&#160; 

prompt corrective action provisions, is well managed, and has at least a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. The Company elected financial holding company status in December 2006. Since July 2011, the Company&#146;s status is dependent on maintaining a well-capitalized and well-managed status under applicable Federal Reserve regulations. If a financial holding company fails to meet these requirements, the Federal Reserve may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. The Federal Reserve may require divestiture of the holding company&#146;s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. 

The Volcker Rule 

The Dodd-Frank Act amended the BHC Act to require federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly called the &#147;Volcker Rule.&#148; The Federal Reserve adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule on December 10, 2013. The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012, and the final rules became effective on April 1, 2014, but the Federal Reserve issued an order on December 18, 2014, extending the period during which institutions have to conform their activities and investments to the requirements of the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2016. The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to grant an additional one-year extension of the conformance period to July 21, 2017. On January 14, 2014, the banking agencies approved an interim rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the prohibitions under the Volcker Rule. Although we continue to evaluate the impact of the Volcker Rule and the final rules adopted, we do not expect that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on the operations of the Company and subsidiaries, as the Company does not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. The Company may incur costs to adopt additional policies and systems to ensure compliance with the Volcker Rule, but any such costs are not expected to be material. 

Anti-Tying Restrictions 

Bank holding companies and their affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of certain services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates. 

Stock Repurchases 

A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, subject to certain exemptions, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases or redemptions in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#146;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

The current risk-based capital guidelines that apply to the Company and the Bank, parts of which are currently being phased in, are based on the December 2010 framework, known as &#147;Basel III,&#148; for strengthening international capital standards by the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (&#147;Basel Committee&#148;), a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, implemented by the Federal Reserve. Prior to January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital guidelines that applied to the Company and the Bank (the &#147;general risk-based capital rules&#148;) were based on the 1988 capital accord, known as &#147;Basel I,&#148; of the Basel Committee. 

Bank holding companies are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve. These rules are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet obligations. The Federal banking agencies&#146; general risk-based capital rules 

&#160; 

applied through December 31, 2014. Under these rules, bank holding companies and banks were required to maintain minimum ratios for Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments and letters of credit). For purposes of calculating the ratios, a banking organization&#146;s assets and some of its specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations were assigned to various risk categories. 

The guidelines classified capital in one of two tiers, depending on type: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tier 1 capital: Tier 1 capital included common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries (and, under existing standards, a limited amount of qualifying trust preferred securities and qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock at the holding company level), less goodwill, most intangible assets, certain accumulated other comprehensive income items and certain other assets. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tier 2 capital: Tier 2 capital included, among other things, perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities not meeting the Tier 1 definition, qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying subordinated debt, and allowances for loan and lease losses, subject to limitations. 

Under the general risk-based capital rules, bank holding companies were required to maintain a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.0% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%. Bank holding companies were also required to maintain a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. Certain highly rated bank holding companies could maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, but other bank holding companies were required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4.0% or more, depending on their condition. 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published the Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and implementing certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements that applied to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including the Company and the Bank, compared to the general risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#146; regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel I capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#146;s 2004 &#147;Basel II&#148; capital accords. The Basel III Capital Rules also implemented the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#146; rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company and the Bank, subject to a phase-in period, on January 1, 2015. 

The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (1) introduce a new capital measure called &#147;Common Equity Tier 1&#148; (&#147;CET1&#148;), (2) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#147;Additional Tier 1 capital&#148; instruments meeting specified requirements, (3) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (4) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the following initial minimum capital ratios became effective as of January 1, 2015: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;) 

&#160; 

The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a &#147;countercyclical capital buffer&#148; that applies to certain covered institutions; however, the buffer is not expected to apply to the Company or the Bank. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1 st , until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company and the Bank to maintain the following minimum ratios: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tier 1 capital to average assets (&#147;leverage ratio&#148;) of 4% (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority&#146;s risk-adjusted measure for market risk). 

The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015, and will be phased in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015, and an additional 20% per year thereafter). 

Under the general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#147;AOCI&#148;) items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. The Company and the Bank made this election to avoid significant changes in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company&#146;s available-for-sale securities portfolio. The Basel III Capital Rules also prevent certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies, subject to phase-out. The rules do not require a phase-out of trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010, for holding companies of depository institutions with less than $15 billion in consolidated total assets, as of December 1, 2009, which includes the Company. Therefore, the Company&#146;s trust preferred securities that were issued before May 19, 2010, are permanently grandfathered in as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital instruments. 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 

&#160; 

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company and the Bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were in effect. With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules also revise the &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; regulations under Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as discussed below under &#147;Prompt Corrective Action.&#148; 

Liquidity Requirements 

Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity was addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the &#147;Liquidity Coverage Ratio&#148; (&#147;LCR&#148;), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity&#146;s expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the &#147;Net Stable Funding Ratio&#148; (&#147;NSFR&#148;), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will incent banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase long-term debt as a funding source. On September 3, 2014, the federal banking agencies finalized the rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approaches banking organizations, neither of which would apply to the Company or the Bank. The federal banking agencies have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR. 

Incentive Compensation 

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;), and the FDIC issued their final guidance on policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking. 

The final guidance, which covers all employees who have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s incentive compensation arrangements should: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; comply with effective internal controls and risk management, and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; support strong corporate governance that includes active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. 

The Federal Reserve indicated that all banking organizations are to evaluate their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk management, controls, and corporate governance processes and immediately address deficiencies in these arrangements or processes that are inconsistent with safety and soundness. 

The Federal Reserve reviews, as part of their regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as ours, that are not large, complex banking organizations. These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#146;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the 

&#160; 

organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#146;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

In February 2011, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC approved a joint proposed rulemaking to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and that are deemed excessive, or may lead to material losses. 

The scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators&#146; policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and we expect those policies to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect our ability to attract, hire, retain, and motivate key employees. 

First Community Bank 

The Bank is a Virginia state-chartered bank supervised and regulated by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions (&#147;Virginia Bureau&#148;). As a member of the Federal Reserve, the Bank&#146;s primary federal regulator is the Federal Reserve Bank (&#147;FRB&#148;) of Richmond. The Virginia Bureau and FRB of Richmond are based in the Company&#146;s home state of Virginia. The regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the Bank&#146;s business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowing, dividends, and location and number of branch offices. 

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

Transactions between the Bank and its non-banking subsidiaries or affiliates, including the Company, are subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act the (&#147;FRA&#148;). In general, Section 23A imposes limits on the amount of such transactions, and requires certain levels of collateral for loans to affiliated parties. It also limits the amount of advances to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of the Company. 

Affiliate transactions are also subject to Section 23B of the FRA that generally requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other non-affiliated persons. The Federal Reserve has issued Regulation W that codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. 

The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA, including an expanded definition of covered transactions and increased amount of time for which collateral requirements on covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, such as the sales on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution&#146;s board of directors. 

The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders, and their related interests contained in the FRA and Regulation O apply to all insured institutions, their subsidiaries, and holding companies. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to such persons. These loans cannot exceed the institution&#146;s total unimpaired capital and surplus, and the FDIC may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate. 

&#160; 

Restrictions on Distribution of Subsidiary Bank Dividends and Assets 

The Company&#146;s primary source of operating funds is dividends paid by the Bank. Capital adequacy requirements that apply to insured depository institutions serve to limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. Under federal law, the Bank cannot pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, it will be classified as undercapitalized. Further, prior approval of the FRB is required if cash dividends declared in any given year exceed the total of the Bank&#146;s net profits for such year, plus its retained profits for the preceding two years. Virginia law also imposes restrictions on the ability of Virginia-chartered banks to pay dividends if such dividends would impair a bank&#146;s paid-in capital. The payment of dividends by the Bank may also be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines. The Virginia Bureau and the FRB have the general authority to limit dividends paid by the Bank if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. 

Because the Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon the subsidiary&#146;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#146;s creditors. In the event of liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, such as the Bank, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors are entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution to its shareholders, including any depository institution holding company or any shareholder or creditor thereof. 

Examinations 

Under the FDIC Improvement Act, all insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examination by their appropriate banking agency and such agency may assess the institution for its costs of conducting the examination. As a state-chartered Federal Reserve member bank, the Bank is subject to examination by the Virginia Bureau and FRB. These examinations review areas such as capital adequacy, reserves, loan portfolio quality, investments, information systems, disaster recovery, contingency planning, management practices, and other compliance issues. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

The various federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted risk-based capital requirements for assessing the capital adequacy of banks and bank holding companies. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the Bank must meet the following initial minimum capital ratios that became effective as of January 1, 2015: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (known as the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;) 

See &#147;Capital Adequacy Requirements&#148; in the &#147;First Community Bancshares, Inc.&#148; section above. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to capital-deficient institutions. Agency regulations define, for each capital category, the levels at which institutions are well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Under the rules in effect through December 31, 2014, a well-capitalized institution had a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or higher, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or higher, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or higher, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, or directive requiring it to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 

&#160; 

The current capital measures, which reflect changes under the Basel III Capital Rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio, and the leverage ratio. A well-capitalized institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An adequately capitalized institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or higher, but does not meet the criteria for a well-capitalized bank. An undercapitalized institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio less than 6.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%. A significantly undercapitalized institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%. A critically undercapitalized institution&#146;s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is considered to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank&#146;s capital category is determined solely for applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#146;s financial condition or prospects for other purposes. The Bank was classified as well capitalized for purposes of the FDIC&#146;s prompt corrective action regulation as of December 31, 2015. 

In addition to requiring undercapitalized institutions to submit a capital restoration plan, agency regulations contain broad restrictions on certain activities of undercapitalized institutions, including asset growth, acquisitions, branch establishment, and expansion into new lines of business. With certain exceptions, an insured depository institution is prohibited from making capital distributions, including dividends, and is prohibited from paying management fees to control persons if the institution would be undercapitalized after any such distribution or payment. 

As an institution&#146;s capital decreases, the federal regulators&#146; enforcement powers become more severe. A significantly undercapitalized institution is subject to mandated capital raising activities, restrictions on interest rates paid and transactions with affiliates, removal of management, and other restrictions. The FDIC has limited discretion in dealing with a critically undercapitalized institution and is generally required to appoint a receiver or conservator. Banks with risk-based capital and leverage ratios below the required minimums may be subject to certain administrative actions, including termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing or temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing if the institution has no tangible capital. 

Deposit Insurance Assessments 

The Bank&#146;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system to evaluate the risk of each financial institution based on three primary sources of information: its supervisory rating, its financial ratios, and its long-term debt issuer rating, if the institution has one. The FDIC&#146;s initial base assessment schedule can be adjusted up or down, and premiums in effect beginning April 1, 2011, ranged from 5 basis points in the lowest risk category to 35 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the DIF&#146;s reserves against future losses, which will require increased deposit insurance premiums that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than $10 billion. In October 2010, the FDIC addressed plans to bolster the DIF by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to 1.35% (ratio of reserves to insured deposits) by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC also proposed to raise its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to 2.00%, 65 basis points above the statutory minimum. 

In February 2011, the FDIC adopted new rules that amend its current deposit insurance assessment regulations. The new rules implement a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that changed the assessment base for deposit 

&#160; 

insurance premiums from one based on domestic deposits to one based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. The rules also changed the assessment rate schedules for insured depository institutions so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected using the new assessment base as would be collected using the current rate schedule and the schedules previously proposed by the FDIC in October 2010. The new rules also revised the risk-based assessment system for large insured depository institutions, which generally include institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets and highly complex institutions, by requiring the FDIC to use a scorecard method to calculate assessment rates for all such institutions. The Bank is not considered a highly complex institution for these purposes. 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (&#147;FDIA&#148;), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

In addition to deposit insurance assessments by the DIF, all FDIC-insured depository institutions must pay an annual assessment to provide funds for the repayment of debt obligations of the Financing Corporation (&#147;FICO&#148;). The FICO is a government-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate disposition of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The Bank&#146;s FICO assessments, which are set quarterly, totaled $139 thousand in 2015 and $147 thousand in 2014. The Bank&#146;s FDIC deposit insurance assessments and premiums totaled $1.42 million in 2015 and $1.59 million in 2014. 

Safety and Soundness Standards 

The FDIA requires that the federal bank regulatory agencies prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and other operational and managerial standards the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder. The agencies adopted regulations that authorize them to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, after being so notified, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA. If an institution fails to follow such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. See &#147;Prompt Corrective Action&#148; in the &#147;Bank&#148; section above. 

Cybersecurity 

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#146;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution&#146;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also 

&#160; 

expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Bank fails to observe the regulatory guidance, the Bank could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank relies on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. The Bank employs an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. The Bank employs a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of the Bank&#146;s defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date, the Bank has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that the Bank could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by the Bank and its customers. See Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity. 

Enforcement Powers 

The FDIC and the other federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Failure to follow applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory agreements could subject us, including officers, directors, and other institution-affiliated parties, to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties. The appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the FDIC as conservator or receiver for a banking institution (or the FDIC may appoint itself, under certain circumstances) if certain circumstances exist, including, without limitation, the banking institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized; fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so; fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan; or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan. 

Consumer Laws and Regulations 

In addition to the laws and regulations discussed in this report, the Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the list set forth is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Fair Housing Act, and various state counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. The Bank must follow the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of their ongoing customer relations. 

Federal law contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the start of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution&#146;s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers&#146; nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, a financial institution may provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties only if the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the CFPB, which implements, examines, and enforces compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans, and credit cards. The CFPB&#146;s functions include investigating consumer complaints, rulemaking, supervising and examining banks&#146; consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, will be subject to these federal consumer financial laws and will continue to be examined for compliance with these laws by their primary federal banking agency. 

Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act 

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (&#147;USA Patriot Act&#148;) was enacted in October 2001. The USA Patriot Act has broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation while imposing new compliance and due diligence obligations on banks and other financial institutions, with a particular focus on detecting and reporting money laundering transactions involving domestic or international customers. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#147;Treasury&#148;) has issued and will continue to issue regulations clarifying the USA Patriot Act&#146;s requirements. The USA Patriot Act requires all financial institutions, as defined, to establish certain anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs. Recently, the regulatory agencies have intensified their examination procedures based on the USA Patriot Act&#146;s anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act requirements. We believe our controls and procedures complied with the USA Patriot Act as of December 31, 2015. 

Interstate Banking and Branching 

Federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks has opted out of the interstate bank merger provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended, (&#147;Riegle-Neal Act&#148;) or by adopting a law after the date of enactment of the Riegle-Neal Act and before June 1, 1997, that applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Such interstate bank mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration limitations described in the Riegle-Neal Act. 

Before the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, national and state-chartered banks were generally permitted to branch across state lines by merging with banks in other states if allowed by the applicable states&#146; laws. However, interstate branching is now permitted for all national and state-chartered banks as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, provided that a state bank chartered by the state in which the branch is to be located would also be permitted to establish a branch, thus effectively giving out-of-state banks parity with in-state banks with respect to de novo branching. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The Treasury&#146;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;) administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them, and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal, financial, and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities to not approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
