PART I 

&#32;Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Our mission is to deliver the best car-buying experience for consumers and provide dealers and automakers with an excellent return on their marketing dollars. We have established a diverse software ecosystem on a common technology infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. We operate our company-branded platform on the TrueCar website and our branded mobile experience. In addition, we customize and operate our platform on a co-branded basis for our many affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions like USAA and American Express, membership-based organizations like Consumer Reports, AARP, Sam's Club, and AAA, and employee buying programs for large enterprises such as IBM and Walmart. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. We also allow automobile manufacturers, known in the industry as OEMs, to connect with TrueCar users in the purchase process and efficiently deliver targeted incentives to consumers. 

We benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have paid for a make and model of car in their area and, where available, estimated prices for that make and model, which we refer to as upfront pricing information, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. This upfront pricing information generally includes guaranteed savings off MSRP which the consumer may then take to the dealer in the form of a Guaranteed Savings Certificate and apply toward the purchase of the specified make and model of car. We benefit our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed, in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe helps them to sell more cars profitably. We benefit OEMs by allowing them to more effectively target their incentive spending at deep-in-market consumers during their purchase process. 

Our network of over 11,000 TrueCar Certified Dealers consists primarily of new car franchises, representing all major makes of cars, as well as independent dealers selling used vehicles. TrueCar Certified Dealers operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 

Our subsidiary, ALG, Inc., provides forecasts and consulting services regarding determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease, and fleet portfolios. We also obtain automobile purchase data from a variety of sources and use this data to provide consumers and dealers with highly accurate, geographically specific, real-time pricing information. 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Consumer 

Consumers interface with us via our website and our TrueCar branded mobile applications and affinity group marketing partner websites. 

The following are key elements of our consumer experience: 

&#160; 

Market pricing data . Through our websites and mobile applications, a consumer selects a vehicle, adds desired options and inputs a ZIP code. In most instances, we then present the consumer with the TrueCar Curve, a graphical distribution of what others paid for the same make and model of car. Within this distribution, we include MSRP, factory invoice, and average price paid for that make and model in the consumer&#8217;s local market. We generally provide consumers with our TrueCar Estimate, which is based on data relevant to the consumer&#8217;s configured vehicle. This information enables the consumer to evaluate a potential price in the context of broader market data. 

In-Stock Offers. In most instances, after reviewing the report with the Estimated Price stating the available Guaranteed Savings off MSRP provided by dealers, the consumer may elect to receive offers on in-stock vehicles from each of the selected dealers; they do so by providing contact information to said dealers. These offers entitle the consumer to receive the stated amount of Guaranteed Savings off MSRP for the consumer&#8217;s selected make and model. While the offer presents the Estimated Price for the in-stock offers, it also entitles the consumer to receive a Guaranteed Savings off MSRP on any vehicle of that particular make and model that the dealer has available for sale. Consumers typically present the offer to the dealer at the time of purchase. 

Dealer 

Our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers interfaces with our platform primarily through our Dealer Portal, an application that can be accessed online or using a mobile device. The Dealer Portal is considered a sales enhancement tool, and it enables dealers to access unique information on their prospects unavailable to them in their standard customer relationship management (CRM) software. The Portal allows dealers to assess the competitiveness of their vehicle pricing relative to their market, create vehicle pricing rules, access details on potential buyers wants and needs, create custom detailed offers based on vehicles in stock, manage how their dealership profile appears on the network, assess their competitive market performance on vehicles sold through their dealership, as well a number of administrative and other management tools. With the mobile application for iOS and Android, dealers also have the ability to provide a price quote on a vehicle relative to the local market, regardless of whether the potential buyer was sourced via the TrueCar network or not. 

&#160; 

Pricing tools . The Pricing Manager provides dealers with a single interface to assess the competiveness of their vehicle pricing relative to their market and set pricing on all makes and models they offer for sale. The Sales Analyzer helps dealers better understand how their pricing for recently sold vehicles compares to the market, whether or not the customer transaction was with one of our users. 

&#160; 

Sales closing tools . The Offer Tool helps dealers create custom detailed offers based on vehicles in stock. The Dealership Profile enables dealers to identify their selling benefits to customers, including salesperson names and pictures, dealership makes, hours of operation and website and social media links. 

&#160; 

Manufacturers 

&#160; 

We enable manufacturers to target consumers based on membership in an affinity group and other criteria. By integrating this process into our platform, manufacturers provide consumers the ability to generate a unique coupon that can be redeemed and validated at any dealership across the country in connection with the purchase of a new car. By tracking these incentives in their own reporting systems, manufacturers can account directly for this method of reaching consumers. These manufacturers pay a per-vehicle fee to us for this service. 

Used car listings 

&#160; 

For consumers looking to purchase a used car, we provide an aggregated listing of used vehicles in their local marketplace. These listings are consolidated from a variety of sources, including members of our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers which sell used cars in addition to new cars, and dedicated non-franchise or independent dealers that do not sell new cars. In addition to displaying stated information made available by the seller about the pricing and condition of car, we provide consumers with information related to the value of other cars of the same make, model, year and stated condition in the market. At our website, the user can contact the seller, identifying herself as a TrueCar user, to initiate communications that may ultimately result in a completed transaction. 

ALG 

We forecast data on residual values of cars and provide this information on a subscription and consultative basis via ALG, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Automotive manufacturers, lenders, lessors, dealers, and software providers use information from ALG to determine the residual value of an automobile at given points in time in the future. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition, financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease, and fleet portfolios. 

Insurance 

We offer insurers FastTrack, a toolset that allows claims representatives to refer consumers who have experienced a vehicle total loss event, when the insurer estimates the repair cost to exceed the replacement value of the vehicle, to our car-buying program. We first introduced this service in 2008. 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Consumer marketing 

&#160; 

We reach consumers through the TrueCar website and our branded mobile applications and websites we maintain for our affinity group marketing partners. Our marketing is focused on building the TrueCar brand. The key tenets of our brand are providing transparent market price information and enhancing the car-buying experience for both consumers and dealers. We divide our marketing spend between traditional media sources, such as television and radio, and digital media. Our consumer brand awareness efforts are aided by the fact that we are quoted in various media outlets from time to time as a recognized industry authority on automotive retail and online data forecasting. 

We also support initiatives for our affinity group marketing partners, including USAA, Consumer Reports, AAA, American Express, and PenFed. These initiatives are designed to promote awareness of the organizations&#8217; car-buying programs among their memberships through a variety of media, including television, email, direct mail, website development, print, online advertising, Internet search engine marketing, Internet search engine optimization, and social networking. 

&#160; 

Dealer engagement and industry relations 

&#160; 

Our dealer sales force is responsible for supporting our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers, optimizing our TrueCar Certified Dealer coverage across brands and geographies and for providing onboarding and dealer support. Our sales force helps dealers grow their businesses by regularly providing data-driven insights on inventory management and pricing. 

&#160; 

Our ability to understand the needs of, actively listen to, and collaborate with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers is crucial to our success. Many of our dealer sales force employees have worked at dealerships or OEMs. In response to feedback from our dealer network, in 2012 we formed an advisory panel of influential dealers to regularly meet with our senior management team to provide updates and opinions on how to improve our role in the car selling experience for dealers. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The automotive retail industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Consumers use a variety of online and offline sources to research vehicle information, obtain vehicle pricing information and identify dealers. In addition, dealers use a variety of marketing channels to promote themselves to consumers. 

&#160; 

Competition for consumer awareness 

&#160; 

We compete to attract consumers directly to our TrueCar.com website and mobile applications primarily on the basis of the quality of the consumer experience; the breadth, depth and accuracy of information; brand awareness and reputation. 

&#160; 

Our principal competitors for consumer awareness include: 

&#8226; 

online automotive classified listings sites such as AutoTrader.com, Cars.com, CarGurus.com, and eBay Motors; 

&#8226; 

online automotive content publishers such as Edmunds.com, KBB.com, and Autobytel.com; 

&#8226; 

Internet search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo; 

&#8226; 

online sites operated by automobile manufacturers, such as General Motors and Ford; 

&#8226; 

membership-based car-buying services, such as the Costco Auto Program, enabling members to purchase cars from affiliated dealers at preferential terms; and 

&#8226; 

offline automotive classified listings, such as trade periodicals and local newspapers. 

&#160; 

Competition for car dealer marketing spend 

&#160; 

We compete for a share of car dealers&#8217; overall marketing expenditures within online and offline media marketing channels. We compete primarily on the basis of the transaction-readiness of our users; the efficiency of customer acquisition as compared to alternative methods; the accountability and measurability of our service; product features, analytics and tools; dealer support; and the size of our prospective car buyer audience. Other businesses also derive a majority of their revenue by offering consumer marketing services to dealers. These companies include listings, information, lead generation and car-buying services, and compete with us for dealer marketing spend. 

&#160; 

Our principal competitors for car dealer marketing spend include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

online automotive content publishers such as Edmunds.com and KBB.com selling impression-based display advertising, and online automotive classified listing sites such as AutoTrader.com and Cars.com selling inventory-based subscription billing; 

&#8226; 

lead generators such as Autobytel.com selling pay-per-lead advertising; 

&#8226; 

Internet search engines such as Google selling cost-per-click advertising; and 

&#8226; 

offline media, including newspaper, outdoor advertising, radio, television and direct mail. 

Technology 

&#160; 

We have designed our technology platform, website and products to provide consumers, dealers and other parties with the information they need to effect a successful car purchase. This platform is accessed by consumers through the TrueCar website and our branded mobile applications and affinity group marketing partner websites and by dealers through our software tools available on our Dealer Portal. Supporting each of these user interfaces are advanced systems for processing and analyzing automotive data, including features such as vehicle configurators and predictive consumer behavior modeling, as well as our proprietary matching algorithm to compare our transaction-based data sources with our record of online users for processing and billing. We use a combination of open source and licensed software running on optimized hardware. 

&#160; 

Our data is housed in co-location facilities in Los Angeles and Chicago. We have adopted a centralized approach to quality assurance and testing for our platform and all products aimed at enhancing consumer and dealer experiences while seeking to optimize availability, scalability, security and performance. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 22 U.S. issued patents, 33 pending U.S. patent applications, 2 issued foreign patents, and 19 pending foreign patent applications. The issued and allowed patents begin expiring in 2029 through 2033. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial to our competitive position. 

We have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks. We registered &#8220;TrueCar,&#8221; the TrueCar logo, various TRUE marks and other marks as trademarks in the U.S. and several other jurisdictions. We also have filed trademark applications for ALG and others in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial to our competitive position. 

&#160; 

In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, and business partners. Our employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use on our website. 

Regulatory Matters 

Various aspects of our business are or may be subject to U.S. federal and state regulation. In particular, the advertising and sale of new or used motor vehicles is highly regulated by the states in which we do business. Although we do not sell motor vehicles, the dealers from which we derive a significant portion of our revenues do sell motor vehicles. Moreover, state regulatory authorities or other third parties could take and, on some occasions, have taken the position that some of the regulations applicable to dealers or to the manner in which motor vehicles are advertised and sold generally are directly applicable to our business model. 

In May 2015, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the California New Car Dealers Association in the Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles (the &#8220;CNCDA Litigation&#8221;). The complaint, both as originally filed and as subsequently amended, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief based on allegations that we are operating in the State of California as an unlicensed automobile dealer and autobroker. On December 7, 2015, the court dismissed this lawsuit &#8220;without prejudice,&#8221; meaning that the complaint could be amended and re-filed. On January 4, 2016, the plaintiff amended and re-filed the complaint. On February 3, 2016, the Company filed a "demurrer" to the amended complaint, which is a pleading that requests the court to dismiss the case. We believe the amended complaint is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the Company in this matter. 

In July 2015, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles (the &#8220;Participating Dealer Litigation&#8221;). The complaint, filed by numerous dealers participating on the TrueCar Platform, and as subsequently amended, sought declaratory and injunctive relief based on allegations that the Company is engaging in unfairly competitive practices and is operating as an unlicensed automobile dealer and autobroker in contravention of various state laws. On September 29, 2015, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this lawsuit &#8220;without prejudice.&#8221; There have been no further pleadings in this action. 

In September 2015, we received a letter from the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles (the &#8220;Texas DMV Notice&#8221;) asserting that certain aspects of our advertising in Texas constitute false, deceptive, unfair, or misleading advertising within the meaning of applicable Texas law. On September 24, 2015, we responded to the Texas DMV Notice in an effort to resolve the concerns raised by the Texas DMV Notice without making material, unfavorable adjustments to our business practices or user experience in Texas. 

In December 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit filed by Gordon Rose in the California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. The complaint asserts claims for unjust enrichment, violation of the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, and violation of the California Business and Professions Code, based in part on allegations that we are operating in the State of California as an unlicensed automobile dealer and autobroker. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of California consumers defined as &#8220;[a]ll California consumers who purchased an automobile by using TrueCar, Inc.&#8217;s price certificate during the applicable statute of limitations.&#8221; On January 12, 2016, the Court entered an order staying all proceedings in the case pending an initial status conference, which is presently scheduled for April 13, 2016. We believe the complaint is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the Company in this matter. 

In order to operate in this highly regulated environment, we have developed our products and services with a view toward appropriately managing the risk that our regulatory compliance or the regulatory compliance of the dealers in our dealer network could be challenged. If, and to the extent that, our products and services fail to satisfy relevant regulatory requirements, our business or our TrueCar Certified Dealers could be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, or the award of significant damages in class action or other civil litigation, as well as orders interfering with our ability to continue providing our products and services in certain states. 

Given the regulatory environment in which we and our participating dealers operate, in designing our products and services, we have focused considerable attention on two areas of state regulation: state advertising regulations and state brokering or &#8220;bird-dogging&#8221; regulations. With respect to advertising, we believe that most of the content displayed on the websites we operate does not constitute advertising for the sale of new motor vehicles. Nevertheless, we endeavor to design the content such that it would comply insofar as practicable with state advertising regulations if and to the extent that the content is considered to be new vehicle sales advertising. With respect to state brokering or &#8220;bird-dogging&#8221; regulations, we have designed our products and services in a manner that aims to avoid the applicability of those regulations. 

Our efforts to design products and services in a manner that appropriately manages the regulatory compliance risk for our business and our participating dealers are complicated by the fact that the related automotive sales and marketing laws vary from state to state, and even within a given state, are frequently susceptible to multiple interpretations. These laws were generally developed decades before the emergence of the Internet, are subject to significant revision or modification, and the manner in which they should be applied to our business model is frequently open to question. As a practical matter, state automobile dealer associations often have considerable influence over the construction of these laws by the relevant state regulatory authorities. Accordingly, in addition to our dialogues with relevant state agencies, we interface on a regular basis with representatives from automobile dealer associations in order to take their views into account as we continually update our products and services. The specific manner in which we have designed our products and services in an effort to manage state regulatory compliance concerns for us and our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers is the result of extensive analysis, which has required the investment of substantial resources that we believe represents a valuable asset of our business. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully comply with current or future regulations to which our business may be subject. 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 574 full-time employees at locations in Santa Monica, Austin, Denver, and San Francisco. We also engage a number of temporary employees and consultants to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Delaware in February 2005 under our then corporate name Zag.com Inc. and began business operations in April 2005. We completed our initial public offering in May 2014 and our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "TRUE."
