&#160; 

Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Center 

&#160; 

One of the main projects of our Company is the Wuhan Yangtze River Newport Logistics Center (the &#8220;Logistics Center&#8221;), which is an extensive complex that is located in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province of China, a major transportation hub with dozens of railways, roads and expressways passing through the city and connecting to major cities in Mainland China, with connections to international centers of commerce and business. 

&#160; 

The Logistics Center is expected to approximately a total of 474 Acres, for which the construction and development are expected to be completed in five years in three phases. It is expected to be located in the Wuhan Newport Yangluo Port, on the upper stream of the Yangtze River, and close to the northern base of Wu Iron and Steel, China's first supergiant iron and steel complex. The Logistics Center is expected to include a port that will be located approximately 26.5km to Wuhan Guan and 5.5km from the Yangluo Yangtze River Bridge. The operation area of the port is expected to consist of a riverbank of 1,039 meters with eight 5,000 to 10,000-ton berths, two of which are multi-purpose berths and the other six to general cargo berths. It is also designed to be able to handle up to five million tons of cargo and containers areas up to 100,000 TEU a year (including two freezers areas of 10,000 TEU). 

&#160; 

Within the Logistics Center, functional areas will be divided into six operating zones, including a port operation area, a warehouse and distribution area, a cold chain supply logistics area, a rail cargo loading area, an exhibition area and a mixed residential and commercial community. The Logistics Center will also be complemented with container storage areas, multi-functional areas, general storage areas, multi-functional warehouse and infrastructural development, including new roads, gas stations, parking areas, gas and water pipes, electricity lines and all other facilities and equipment to operate the Logistics Center. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Aside from being situated in the Wuhan Yangluo Comprehensive Bonded Zone, Yangluo development area is amongst the third group of China&#8217;s Free-Trade Zone (FTZ) applicants to submit FTZ applications to the State Council through the Wuhan municipal government for approval. Approvals have so far been granted to Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong and Fujian. Enterprises within the approved free-trade zones are typically entitled to a series of favorable regulations and policies that could help the businesses grow and succeed. 

&#160; 

Wuhan Newport has signed an agreement to rent 1.2 million square meters of land on a long term basis for building logistics warehouses covering 400,000 square meters in support of the new port. The warehouses is expected to comprise of port terminal zones, warehouse logistics zones, cold chain supply zones and railroad loading and unloading zones. The warehouses, once constructed, will connect the port terminal along the Yangtze River and the railway leading to Europe, satisfying the requirement of China&#8217;s latest &#8220;One Belt, One Road&#8221; initiative. It will also be able to support large logistics companies in Wuhan and other nearby provinces that lease the warehouses, terminals and offices.

&#160; 

Logistics Center Highlights: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The shipping center of Wuhan Newport will be implemented under China&#8217;s latest &#8220;One Belt, One Road&#8221; initiative to promote the &#34;Yangtze River Economic Belt&#34; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Wuhan Newport is part of the Yangluo port, which is part of the area that is currently seeking approval for status as a &#34;Free-Trade Zone&#34; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Wuhan Newport is part of the &#34;Yangluo Comprehensive Bonded Zone&#34;, which allows the enterprises in the zone to receive certain favorable tax treatments such as export tax rebates and less or free of value-added tax and consumption tax &#160; 

The &#8220;One Belt, One Road&#8221; Initiative. 

&#160;

China&#8217;s &#8220;one belt one road&#8221; transportation infrastructure development strategy aiming to link Asia with Africa and Europe has spurred the development of more international air routes from second-tier cities such as Wuhan, Changsha, Xiamen and Urumqi. The belt manifests the continental dimension of this geo-strategic realm. The &#8220;Belt&#8221; consists of a network of rail routes, overland highways, oil and gas pipelines and other infrastructural projects, stretching from Xian in Western China, through Central Asia and into Russia, with one artery crossing Kazakhstan and the other through Mongolia but both linking up with the trans-Siberian railway and going on to Rotterdam.

&#160;

The &#8220;Road&#8221; is the maritime dimension and consists of a network of ports and other coastal infrastructure from China&#8217;s eastern seaboard stretching across South East Asia, South Asia, the Gulf, East Africa and the Mediterranean, forming a loop terminating at Greece, Italy and Netherlands in Europe and Kenya in Africa.

&#160;

The Belt and the Road run through the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa, connecting the vibrant East Asia economic circle at one end and developed European economic circle at the other, and encompassing countries with huge potential for economic development.

&#160;

Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the strategic conception of building the &#34;Silk Road Economic Belt&#34; and &#34;21st Century Maritime Silk Road&#34;, known shortly as the &#34;One Belt and One Road&#34; initiatives in September, 2013. The proposal garnered the interest of the global community, as soon as it was announced. Various countries along the proposed route have expressed broad support, while domestic cities and provinces, which were part of the ancient Silk Road, have welcomed the idea. Over the past year, China and relevant countries, together with regional organizations, have put in a lot of efforts to jointly build the 'One Belt and One Road'. They have devised innovative methods to strengthen bilateral ties and enhance regional cooperation and have made impressive progress.

&#160;

This visionary conception that leverages on China's historical connections has created a new opportunity to rejuvenate the economic and cultural ties built via the ancient Silk Road. It presents a &#34;win-win approach&#34; to peaceful coexistence and mutual development. The idea carries forward the spirit of the ancient Silk Road that was based on mutual trust, equality and mutual benefits, inclusiveness and mutual learning, and win-win cooperation. It also conforms to the 21st century norms of promoting peace, development, cooperation and adopting a win-win strategy for all. The conception organically links the &#34;Chinese dream&#34; to the &#34;Global Dream&#34; and has far-reaching strategic significance with a global impact.

&#160; 

Office Complex Project 

&#160; 

Taking into consideration the Comprehensive Bonded Zone and Free Trade Zone status of the Logistic Center, Wuhan Newport has obtained the land use rights to own approximately 500,000 square meters of commercial lands on which Wuhan Newport will build a mixed residential and office complex of approximately 700,000 square meters. As of the date of this Annual Report, mixed-use complex totaling approximately 100,000 square meters have been completed and there are outstanding 600,000 square meters to be constructed in three phases within the next five (5) years. 

&#160; 

To support the office complex, a light railway from downtown Wuhan to the complex is undergoing construction, for which the complex will be accessible by two stations along the light railway line. In addition, an expressway along the north shore of the Yangtze River in Wuhan is currently under construction; the completion of the highway is also expected to provide direct ground access between Wuhan city center and the Logistics Center and cut down the commute time to only 20 minutes. 

&#160; 

Upon completion of the construction of the office buildings, Wuhan Newport plans to sell half of the complex while leasing out the remaining half for long-term income. It is Company&#8217;s goal to recover the initial investment costs through sale of half of the complex and generate a stable return based on rent of the other half complex upon completion of the project.

Corporate History 

&#160;

On December 23, 2009, the Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of &#8220;Ciglarette International, Inc.&#8221;. Our operations at the time consisted of marketing and distributing a &#8220;smokeless&#8221; cigarette. During that time, we had no revenue and our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of our business plan and target customer market. 

&#160; 

On March 1, 2011, the Company completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with Kirin China Holding, a British Virgin Islands company (&#8220;Kirin China&#8221;), whereby the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Kirin China in exchange for 18,547,297 shares of common stock, which represented approximately 98.4% of the total shares outstanding immediately following the closing of this share exchange (the &#8220;First Share Exchange&#8221;). Upon consummation of the First Share Exchange, Company changes its name to &#8220;Kirin International Holding, Inc.&#8221; and traded under the symbol &#8220;KIRI&#8221; on OTC Markets. As a result of the First Share Exchange, Kirin China became a wholly-owned subsidiary. The Company ceased the smokeless cigarette business and became a holding company, through various controlled entities in the China, engaged in the development and operation of real estate in China. Through Kirin China, Company engaged in private real estate development focusing on residential and commercial real estate development in &#8220;tier-three&#8221; cities in China. Tier-three cities are provincial capital cities with ordinary economic development and prefecture cities with relatively strong economic development. 

&#160;

On December 19, 2015, Company entered into certain share exchange agreements with Energetic Mind and all the shareholders of Energetic Mind whereby the Company acquired 100% issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Energetic Mind (the &#8220;Second Share Exchange&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the agreements for the Second Share Exchange, in exchange for 100% issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Energetic Mind, the Company agreed to issue to (i) the shareholders of Energetic Mind an aggregate of one hundred fifty-one million (151,000,000) shares of Company&#8217;s common stock and (2) a certain related party an additional 8% convertible promissory note in the principal amount of one hundred fifty million dollars ($150,000,000), with a conversion price of $10.00 per share. 

&#160;

The sale of Kirin China also effectively terminated Company&#8217;s contractual relationship with Hebei Zhongding Real Estate Development Co. Ltd and Xingtai Zhongding Jiye Real Estate Development Co., Ltd, both of which are companies formed under the laws of the People&#8217;s Republic of China and were deemed Company&#8217;s variable interest entities prior to this sale (&#8220;Subsidiaries Sale&#8221;). 

&#160;

As a result of the Second Share Exchange and the Subsidiaries Sale, the Company currently operates its business solely through its wholly-owned subsidiary Energetic Mind, which is the sole shareholder of Ricofliz, which engages its business through its wholly-owned subsidiary Wuhan Newport. 

&#160;

On January 13, 2016, Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) with the Secretary of the State of the State of Nevada, changing its name from &#8220;Kirin International Holding, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Yangtze River Development Limited&#8221;. Effective January 22, 2016, Company changed its stock symbol from &#8220;KIRI&#8221; to &#8220;YERR&#8221;.

&#160;

The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure as of the date of this Annual Report: 

&#160;

&#160; 

Transportation and Logistics Services 

&#160; 

Taking the regional advantage of the highways, railways and waterways in Yangluo area, Company plans to develop a shipping hub with access to all types of cargo transportation and offer complementary services to businesses within this logistics center. The Company intends to create an efficient, reliable and comprehensive logistics service system by utilizing the third-party service providers with offices within the Logistics Center to provide professional logistics services.

&#160; 

Company is currently constructing the port terminal which will be the focal point of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The Yangtze River riverbank within our properties measures 1,039 meters, where we plan to complete eight cargo berths handling ships ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 tons. 

&#160; 

A cargo transportation railway invested by the government has been built next to the Logistic Center. The railway is known as the Wuhan-Xinjiang-Europe (&#8220;WXE&#8221;) Railway in the Silk Road Economic Zone as it is in the &#8220;One Belt, One Road&#8221; initiative introduced by the Chinese government. The WXE Freight Train sets out from Wuhan to Xinjiang and finally ends in Mainland Europe. Wuhan Newport&#8217;s terminal is therefore an important component of the &#8220;Silk Road Economic Belt&#8221; under the &#8220;One Belt, One Road&#8221; framework. 

&#160; 

The customs facility at the Yangluo Comprehensive Bonded Area allow cargo vessels ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 tons to set out from Shanghai downstream via the Yangtze River in order to transport &#8220;Made in China&#8221; commodities to the Pacific Ocean and further to any other ports across the Indian Ocean. In return transporting commodities from other countries will be shipped directly back to Wuhan and then distributed throughout rest of the Mainland China. Aside from being situated in the Wuhan Yangluo Comprehensive Bonded Zone, Yangluo development area is amongst the third group of China&#8217;s Free-Trade Zone (FTZ) applicants to submit FTZ applications to the State Council through the Wuhan municipal government for approval. Approvals have so far been granted to Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong and Fujian. Enterprises within the approved free-trade zones are typically entitled to a series of favorable regulations and policies that could help the businesses grow and succeed. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Cold Chain Logistics Services 

&#160; 

A cold chain is a temperature-controlled supply chain. An unbroken cold chain is an uninterrupted series of storage and distribution activities which maintain a given temperature range. It is used to help extend and ensure the shelf life of products such as fresh agricultural produce, seafood and frozen food. 

&#160; 

Within the Logistics Center, Company will provide extensive storage and processing services to its customers. Meanwhile, a cold chain logistics service system will be established to better help Company&#8217;s clients&#8217; processing needs for their frozen foods, meats and other products that need special processing and handling. In addition, Company will offer professional services with temperature control, sorting, processing, packaging and delivery to ensure the reliability and safety of the logistics process. 

&#160; 

Information Platform 

&#160; 

To adapt to the needs of modern logistics service and meet the standards of the industry worldwide, Company will establish comprehensive automated management systems, as well as develop an operation system, enquiry system and decision-making systems for all types of business information such as warehouse, storage, trade, distribution and transportation, movable assets supervision and freight forwarding. Company plans to launch an integrated and information-sharing platform geared towards the demand of its targeted markets and potential clients.

&#160; 

Company will establish a uniform information platform including an internet-based logistics information portal and an e-commerce platform to provide the Company&#8217;s clients with services such as logistics services tracking, service rating, online operation, electronic transaction, and etc. Company expects this information portal to be equally reliable for both service providers and their respective clients. 

&#160; 

Company will also establish an e-commerce system based on the logistics information portal and it will provide clients with many updated services such as online transactions, online payments, online inquiries and business information communication. This will create a comprehensive service system and a business model with high integration of information flow, capital flow, trade flow and goods flow. 

&#160; 

Portside Service 

&#160; 

Company also plans to provide incentives for companies that specialize in IT, production of new material and high-end equipment and manufacturing companies to station nearby the Logistics Center so that these companies can grow with the Logistics Center, leveraging each other&#8217;s specialization to serve each other&#8217;s business needs. 

&#160; 

Logistics Financing 

&#160; 

Logistics financing is mainly based on using supplies as collateral to obtain financing for supply chains to improve its overall economic efficiency. Developing an innovative logistics financing is significant because traditionally mortgages or loans are concentrated in real estate and logistics financing provides a lower systematic risk for lenders. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Compared to developed countries, logistics financing is a rather new field in China with a huge market potential of about 7 trillion RMB. The driving force for logistics financial service in western countries is mainly attributable to financial institutions as opposed to third-party private logistics companies in China who would occasionally provide financing options. 

&#160; 

Logistics financial services became a popular investment vehicle among these third-party lenders. However, the business of logistics financing has become more complex for these private lenders to handle as they will need professional service to guide them the process and thus safeguard their investments. 

&#160; 

According to the data from China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, the total nationwide logistics in 2011 amounted to RMB 158.4 trillion which year-on-year growth rate is 12.3%. It decreased 2.7% compared to that of last year. The growth trend of the total nationwide logistics is high in first half year while low in last half year&#8212;it is 14.2% in the first quarter, 13.7% in the first half year and 13.4% in the first three quarters. Total nationwide logistics fees are 8.4 trillion Yuan which year-on-year growth rate is 18.5% an increase of 1.8% compared to that of last year. Data from China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing also shows that the proportion of total logistics fees to GDP in 2011 is 17.8%, which is almost same as that of last year. This means the logistics cost of social economic operation is still high. As an important part of a productive service industry, the position of the logistics industry in the national economy is more and more significant. It promotes the development of the growth and the maturity of the economy and society. The huge market space of logistics industry also attracts banks to enter the market. 

&#160; 

Even though the history of logistics financing has been relatively short in China, the appetite for this is expected to grow as the Free Trade Zones in Shanghai, Tianjin and soon-to-be Wuhan will likely attract more business and international financial institutions. Logistics financing not only provides the businesses with a new alternative to meet their capital needs, but also opens a new channel for commercial banks to reach small and midsize businesses. While interest income generated from logistics financing transaction is often an important source of income for many multinational logistics companies, companies who are able to provide financing are often the industry leaders. Because logistics financing can be an effective channel for the Company to reach its targeted market, our Company plans to capture this first-mover advantage when logistics financing is still in its development stage in China. 

&#160; 

In light of this market opportunity, Company plans to establish and utilize e-commerce platforms to offer online booking, online dealing and online exhibiting services to provide professional transaction services for electronic products, commodity, foods and metals. Company also plans to provide comprehensive support services to complement logistics financing. Maritime insurance and training services will be offered within the Logistic Center. Company plans to help its clients to raise construction capital through Build-Transfer (BT), Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), corporate debt and equity financing. Company also plans to collaborate and develop strategic alliances with other logistics or cargo shipping centers around the world. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Company plans to enter the market by collaboration with two strategic partners &#8211; CMST Development (Hankou) Co. Ltd. (&#8220;CMST&#8221;) and Hubei Province Chamber of Commerce (&#8220;HPCC&#8221;).

&#160;

CMST is a state-owned enterprise that is principally engaged in the logistics and trading business. The company and its subsidiaries are primarily involved in the storage, sale and distribution of merchandises, and freight forwarding. As part of the collaborate, CMST has agreed to transfer storage and processing, logistics and other existing services to Wuhan Newport, including a turnover of more than 5 million tons of steel per year. Because of the collaboration, Company plans to offer the warehouse processing zones and provide the partner companies with professional service and advice. While company is responsible for providing storage areas, railway access, port terminal and equipment installation, along with a commodities trading e-commerce platform to provide a comprehensive range of supply chain for financial support services, CMST is responsible for warehouse operations management and client sourcing. Both companies will work together to create Wuhan Newport as a national logistics center and establish a greater influence on the commodity professional market. Company is expected to receive fees based on their use of the warehouse and terminal, as well as other services within the Logistics Center.

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Company has also been collaborating with Hubei-Jin Business Chamber of Commerce (&#8220;Hubei-Jin&#8221;) as Hubei-Jin intends to move its headquarter to the Logistics Center. Hubei -Jin works with approximately fifty companies in the iron and steel production and trading business. Optimistic about the geographic advantages and appreciation potential of the Logistics Center, Hubei-Jin has committed to a total of not less than 100,000 square meters of office space and is expected to move in occupying the office spaces. While their biggest needs will be the warehouse within the Logistics Center, Hubei-Jin is also expected to use company&#8217;s port terminal, waterways, railways and other logistics services, for all of which Company will charge Hubei-Jin a service fee. 

&#160;

PRC Logistics Industry Overview 

&#160; 

According to the National Bureau of Statistics of the PRC, China&#8217;s nominal GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate of 15.8% between 1980 and 2013 and reached RMB 56.9 trillion in 2013. Adjusted for inflation, China&#8217;s real GDP maintained an average annual growth rate of 9.9% between 1980 and 2013, significantly outpacing the world&#8217;s other major economies, such as the United States, Japan, India and Germany. Since 2010, China has been the world&#8217;s second largest economy behind the United States.

&#160; 

The logistics industry has become the new increasing point of China&#8217;s economy in the 21st century. In recent years, third party logistics indicated a tendency towards rapid increase, increasing from 40 billion in 2001 to 500 billion in 2013 with a 25% annual increase rate at average. Among these third party logistics companies, 70% of them had a 30% increase in their revenue annually and 20% of them had their revenue doubled each year. 

&#160; 

The Rise of Logistics Finance 

&#160;

Logistics finance provides financial services such as financing, clearance and insurance to support the logistics industry. It evolves as the logistics industry develops. Not only can logistics finance services improve the service capability and increase the profitability of the third party logistics companies, it can also expand financing channels, decrease financing cost and increase the capital efficiency. 

&#160; 

Compared with developed countries, logistics finance is a new field in China with huge market potential of about 7 trillion RMB. The driving force for logistics financial services in western countries are mainly financial institutes while it is the third party logistics corporations in China that provide such services. Logistics financial services appear along with modern third party logistics corporations. The business of logistic financial services for modern third party logistics corporations is more complex than before in that it not only includes modern logistics service but is part of finance services. 

&#160;

According to the data from China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, total nationwide logistics amount in 2011 is 158.4 trillion Yuan which year-on-year growth rate is 12.3%. It decreases 2.7% comparing with that of last year. The growth trend of total nationwide logistics amounts is high in first half year while low in last half year&#8212;it is 14.2% in the first quarter, 13.7% in the first half year and 13.4% in the first three quarters. Total nationwide logistics fees are 8.4 trillion Yuan which have a year-on-year growth rate of 18.5% and increase to 1.8% compared that of last year. Data from the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing also shows that proportion of total logistics fee to GDP in 2011 is 17.8% which is almost same to that of last year. It means the logistics cost of social economic operation is still high. As an important part of a productive service industry, the position of the logistics industry in national economy is more and more significant. It promotes the development of the economy. The huge market space of logistics industry also attracts banks to enter the market. 

&#160;

The major target client for logistics finance service are small or medium size companies, which are the main players in China&#8217;s economy and have a great weight in the market. One of the biggest hurdles in the life circle of these small or medium size companies is lack of cash flow, which always becomes the &#8220;bottle neck&#8221; of their development and prevents them from moving forward. The need for logistics financing is because of the lack of available credit financing facilities and incapability of financing on the capital markets. 

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Therefore, logistics finance services solve the financing problem by allowing these small and medium companies to use its raw materials and commodities as collateral to borrow money. Logistics financing increases the liquidity of cash flow, lowers the clearance risks and improves the efficiency of the economic operation. It is conservatively estimated that the logistics finance market in China is over 1,000 billion RMB. China&#8217;s logistics finance is a huge growing space. 

&#160; 

Market Overview of Wuhan 

&#160; 

Located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Wuhan has been regarded as the gateway to nine provinces nearby. Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and the Yangtze River converge in Wuhan and also Beijing-Jiulong Railway and Beijing-Guangzhou Railway intersect in it, thus forming a railway network linking North China, Southwest China, Central South China and East China. Moreover, Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway and Shanghai-Chengdu Expressway converge in Wuhan and a high-speed railway along the Yangtze River will be completed here soon. Therefore, a &#8220;flexible multimodal transportation system&#8221; combining expressways, high-speed railways and water transportation on the Yangtze River will give greater prominence to Wuhan's position of strategic importance as a junction of water and land transportation in China.

&#160;

Wuhan is the largest inland logistics and cargo distribution center in China, with its service covering approximately a 400 million populations in the five neighboring provinces including Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan and Sichuan. At present, there are over 10,000 commercial organizations, 105,000 commodity networks, four commercial listed enterprises as well as eight comprehensive shopping centers on the list of China Top 100 Retail Shopping Centers.

&#160;

China is thoroughly implementing the strategy of coordinated regional development, expanding domestic demand, innovation-driven development and new urbanization, and building a new economic support belt relying on the Yangtze River. As a central city in the central region and the middle reach of the Yangtze River, and the country&#8217;s major transportation hub and science and technology base, Wuhan faces multiple overlapping strategic opportunities. Location, transportation, science, education, market and other advantages will be further enhanced and fully released and more quickly transformed into development and competitive advantage.

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Wuhan is a major transportation hub of China situated at the midstream of the Yangtze River. Going west alongside the Yangtze, upstream are the cities in Chongqing, Sichuan, Yunnan and Qinghai. Going east downstream are provinces of Hunan, Anhui and Jiangsu, as well as the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, until finally arriving at the sea. The railway runs north bound to Harbin, westbound to Urumqi, east bound to Shanghai and south bound to the Shenzhen Highway and expressways that stretch in all directions ensuring easy and convenient transportation to all provinces in China. Likewise, Wuhan is largest economic city in central China with an annual GDP beyond 1,000 billion RMB. In 2015, the China State Council introduced and implemented the Midstream Yangtze River City Group Development Plan headed by Wuhan. In fact, the city was once called &#8220;The Oriental Chicago&#8221; by the US Harper&#8217;s Magazine back in 1918.

With the rapid development of inland water shipping in China, logistics and port management industry has grown significantly. Wuhan is one of the major inland water ports in China. In 2014, Wuhan government released an Opinion On Accelerating The Establishment Of Shipping Center In The Middle Reach Of Yangtze River , indicated that the government will help the Wuhan shipping center to be a well-equipped, surrounding industry developed internationally with a scaled and intelligent inland water shipping center with all port and shipping resources highly concentrated. In the Development Plan On Wuhan Logistics Space (2012-2020) , Wuhan is strategically positioned as the critical joint of the global supply chain and the logistics transportation hub and information center of China.

&#160;

Wuhan has supported many logistics companies, including, as of March 2014, 99 tier-one logistics companies, which are supported by the local government that aims to forming a multi-dimension logistics industry in Wuhan by providing meaningful support to promising logistics companies. 

&#160;

However, in Wuhan, logistics for domestic trade operated separately from that for international trade and all resources are scattered and not concentrated enough to form a well-organized and well-managed international supply chain. It becomes very difficult for Wuhan to realize the synergy of business, logistics, money and information. In addition, a majority of the current logistics companies in Wuhan focus on traditional cargo transportation and storage services. Therefore, there exists an opportunity for an efficient, comprehensive and modern logistics service center to facilitate the channel of both regional and global logistics.
