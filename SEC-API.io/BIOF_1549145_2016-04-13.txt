 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Background 

Business Overview 

Alliance Bioenergy Plus, Inc (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a technology company focused on emerging technologies in the renewable energy, biofuels and new technologies sectors. From inception through December 5, 2014, the Company was known as Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. At inception (March 28, 2012), the Company was organized as a vehicle to engage in the commercial production, distribution and exploitation of Motion Pictures and other Entertainment products. However, in December 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, AMG Renewables, LLC (&#147;AMG Renewables&#148;), acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group, LLC (&#147;AMG Energy&#148;), which owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC (&#147;Carbolosic&#148;), which holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida&#146;s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428) known as &#147;CTS&#153;&#148;. The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company&#146;s goal in acquiring the interest in AMG Energy is to develop the CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective licensees. In September 2014, the Company determined to focus all of the Company&#146;s resources and personnel on the Company&#146;s renewable energy holdings and future energy technologies and to divest the Company of its entertainment-related assets and subsidiaries. The principal reason for such action was the recognition that the Company&#146;s entertainment-related assets were generating substantial losses and contributing little value compared to the potential management saw in the energy-related activities and to provide a clear focus and direction to the Company moving forward. The Company therefore determined at that time to divest and sell off, close down or discontinue the operations of its entertainment-related subsidiaries. Subsequently, the Company determined that the name Alliance Media Group Holdings, Inc. was no longer relevant to the new business direction of the Company and, effective December 5, 2014, amended the Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Alliance Bioenergy Plus, Inc., which is more appropriately descriptive of the new business direction of the Company. 

The Company is focused on one industry &#150; Renewable Energy. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, AMG Renewables, LLC and Carbolosic Plant 1, LLC, which in turn owns controlling interests in AMG Energy Group, LLC, and Ek Laboratories, Inc., the Company has a strategy that includes growth in its energy-related activities as well as mergers and acquisitions and start-up activities which are focused on development of an increasing revenue stream, secure market share and enhancement of shareholder value. 

AMG RENEWABLES, LLC 

AMG Renewables, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (&#147;AMG Renewables&#148;), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, created for the purpose of managing and developing the Company&#146;s renewable energy technology enterprises. AMG Renewables has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Carbolosic Plant 1, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (&#147;Carbolosic Plant 1&#148;), and two majority owned subsidiaries, AMG Energy Group, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (&#147;AMG Energy&#148;) and Ek Laboratories, Inc, a Florida corporation (&#147;EK&#148;) formerly known as Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology, Inc. 

&#9679; On December 26, 2013, AMG Renewables acquired the controlling interest (51%) in AMG Energy Group from certain related parties for a consideration comprising $2,200,000 cash and delivery of 7,266,000 shares of Company Common Stock. In connection with the transaction, an amount which the Company owed to AMG Energy ($214,894) for various loans and consulting fees was eliminated in the acquisition. On December 26, 2013, 7,000,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered to AMG Energy Solutions, Inc. (a related party) and the remaining 266,000 shares of Company common stock were delivered on June 18, 2014 to Wellington Asset Holdings, Inc. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has paid $168,742 of the $2,200,000 cash payable on account of this transaction, and as of such date, the Company has not paid the remaining amount, which amount has been recorded on the books of the Company as a related party payable relating to an acquisition. &#160; 

&#9679; AMG Energy owns a fifty percent (50%) interest of Carbolosic, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#147;Carbolosic&#148;), which holds an exclusive worldwide license to the University of Central Florida&#146;s patented technology (U.S. Patent 8,062,428) known as &#147;CTS&#153;&#148;. The CTS technology is a mechanical/chemical, dry process for converting cellulose material into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing. The Company&#146;s goal is to develop this CTS technology to a commercial scale and then seek to license the technology to prospective licensees. &#160; 

On May 13, 2015, AMG Energy entered into a series of agreements with various unrelated third parties, wherein AMG Energy sublicensed the CTS technology to Naldogen (Pty) Ltd., an existing South African company, which will be renamed Carbolosic Energy SA PTY LTD (&#147;Carbolosic SA&#148;). Carbolosic SA shall be solely devoted to exploitation of the CTS technology in South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana and the term of the sublicense is coterminous with the master license (i.e. through July 1, 2032). The consideration for the grant of the sublicense is $25,000,000 (&#147;License Fee&#148;), which must be paid or guaranteed by March 1, 2016. In addition to the license fee, the sublicense holder will pay AMG Energy a royalty of 3.5% of the revenues on the first CTS plant developed and a 5.0% royalty on the revenues of additional plants developed. Until the $25,000,000 payment has been received, the Company does not consider all of the events required under the agreement to have been completed. Therefore the Company has not recorded any of the license fee in the accompanying financial statements. &#160; 

Contemporaneously, Carbolosic SA&#146;s shareholders entered into an agreement whereby, among other matters, it was agreed that ownership of Carbolosic SA shall be 43.5% for Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd, a South African company (&#147;Tes&#148;), 24.5 % for Spearhead Capital Ltd, a Seychelles company (&#147;Spearhead&#148;), 7.5% for Jupiter Trust, a South African Trust (&#147;Jupiter&#148;) and 24.5% for Alliance BioEnergy Plus, Inc. TES, Spearhead and Jupiter are all unrelated to the Company. The interests of Tes and Jupiter are delivered in consideration of the funding or guarantee of funding of the License Fee; Spearhead&#146;s interest is in consideration of facilitating the Sublicense transaction; and the Company&#146;s interest is in exchange for the delivery to Carbolosic SA of a 24.5% interest in one of the Company&#146;s CTS sugar extracting plants to be developed in the United States. &#160; 

In February 2016, due to economic and political turmoil in South Africa, members of Tes Projects (Pty) Ltd and Jupiter Trust resigned from management and from the Board of Carbolosic SA and returned all ownership interest in Carbolosic SA to the Carbolosic SA treasury. Spearhead Capital intends to continue operations of Carbolosic SA but at this time there is no guarantee that they will be successful in securing the needed funds or contracts to do so. The Company will evaluate its position in Africa in the coming months and decide on a path forward. &#160; 

&#9679; Carbolosic Plant 1 was created in October 2014 for the purpose of being a full scale facility for converting cellulose material into sugar for use in the biofuels industry as well as other fine chemical manufacturing located in Palm Beach County, FL. In March 2016, Carbolosic Plant 1 was sold to Carbolosic Energy 1, LLLP, a non-related third party, in exchange for satisfaction of the outstanding $1,250,000 loan. In addition, Company subsidiary AMG Energy Group issued a Sub-License to Carbolosic Plant 1 for the use of the patented CTS technology in one (1) plant to be located in the U.S., under the terms and conditions of the master license agreement between Company affiliate Carbolosic, LLC and the University of Central Florida. The sub-license has a royalty payment of three percent (3%) of gross sales and twenty percent (20%) of the net profits of Carbolosic Plant 1 payable to AMG Energy Group and is awaiting final approval from the University of Central Florida as is required under the master license agreement. 

&#9679; EK, was created in December 2014 under the name Central Florida Institute of Science and Technology, Inc. and changed its name to Ek Laboratories, Inc. on June 05, 2015. EK was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of AMG Energy, to serve as a demonstration and research facility to further develop the CTS process, its uses, and develop new technologies. 

The Company believes that its management and consultants have significant experience in the bio-fuels, renewable energy and chemical manufacturing industries. As of this date, the Company has not generated any revenues from its renewable energy business.
