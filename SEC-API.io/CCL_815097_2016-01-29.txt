A. Overview 

I. 

Summary 

Carnival Corporation was incorporated in Panama in 1972 and Carnival plc was incorporated in England and Wales in 2000. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc operate a dual listed company (&#8220;DLC&#8221;), whereby the businesses of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are combined through a number of contracts and through provisions in Carnival Corporation&#8217;s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Carnival plc&#8217;s Articles of Association. The two companies operate as if they are a single economic enterprise with a single senior executive management team and identical Boards of Directors, but each has retained its separate legal identity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are both public companies with separate stock exchange listings and their own shareholders. See Note 3, &#8220;DLC Arrangement&#8221; to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K. Together with their consolidated subsidiaries, Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are referred to collectively in this Form 10-K as &#8220;Carnival Corporation &#38; plc,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;we.&#8221; 

We are the largest leisure travel company in the world, and among the most profitable and financially strong with a market capitalization of over $38 billion at January 22, 2016. We are also the largest cruise company having carried 47% of global cruise guests and a leading provider of vacations to all major cruise destinations throughout the world (see Part I, Item 1. Business. C. &#8220;Our Global Cruise Business &#8211; Cruise Programs&#8221;). We operate 99 cruise ships within a portfolio of ten leading global, regional and national cruise brands that sell tailored cruise products, services and vacation experiences in all the world&#8217;s most important vacation geographic areas. We believe having global and regional brands that are serving multiple countries and national brands that are tailored to serve individual countries provides us with a unique advantage to compete within the entire travel and leisure market for consumers' discretionary vacation spending. The descriptions of the principal vacation geographic areas where we source substantially all of our guests and our brands that market primarily to these guests are discussed in Part I, Item1. Business. C. &#8220;Our Global Cruise Business &#8211; Principal Source Geographic Areas and Cruise Brands.&#8221; 

II. 

Vision, Goals and Related Strategies &#32; 

Our vision is to deliver unmatched joyful vacation experiences and breakthrough total shareholder returns by exceeding guest expectations and achieving the full benefits inherent in our scale. We believe our portfolio of global, regional and national brands is instrumental to us achieving our vision and maintaining our cruise industry leadership positions, which includes having a leading cruise brand selling in each of our primary source geographic areas targeting specific guest segments. Our primary financial goals are to profitably grow our cruise business and increase our return on invested capital, reaching double digit returns in the next two to three years, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our ability to generate significant operating cash flows allows us to internally fund our capital investments. As we drive toward double digit returns with increasing operating cash flows, we are committed to returning free cash flows to our shareholders in the form of dividends and/or share buybacks. In 2015, we increased our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share from $0.25 per share and repurchased $276 million of our shares. In addition, we are committed to maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings. 

To reach our primary financial goals, we continue to implement initiatives to create additional demand for our brands, ultimately leading to higher revenue yields. We believe measured capacity growth further drives higher revenue yields. We will continue to identify opportunities to enhance our cruise products and services and optimize our cost structure while preserving the unique identities of our individual brands. We have made significant investments to gain insight into our guests&#8217; decision making by evaluating data included in our global database of guests to identify vacationers&#8217; needs enabling us to further grow our share of their vacation spend. We have also implemented strategies to grow demand by increasing consumer awareness and consideration of our cruise brands and the global cruise industry through coordinated media communication, expanded trade-show presence and advertising. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, we continue to identify and implement new strategies and tactics to strengthen our cruise ticket revenue management processes and systems across our portfolio of brands, such as optimizing our pricing methodologies and improving our pricing models. In addition, we are in the process of developing a state-of-the-art revenue management system that will ultimately enable our brands to further optimize pricing and inventory. We are also implementing new initiatives to better coordinate and optimize our brands' global deployment strategies to maximize guest satisfaction and itinerary profits. We have tools and are implementing big data analytic solutions that will continue to enable us to perform customer segmentation analyses, evaluate our guests&#8217; decision making process and identify new growth opportunities to expand our customer base. We are also implementing initiatives to strengthen our onboard revenue programs. 

We believe that we have significant opportunities to continue to grow our presence in China due to its large and growing middle-class population and expansion of their international tourism. It is estimated that Chinese cruise demand will increase to over 4 million annual cruisers by 2020. The Chinese government has expressed a strong desire to transform China into a leading global cruise region and is making substantial investments in cruise-related infrastructure. As we execute our strategy to accelerate growth in China, we have the benefit of nine years of local experience to help guide our expansion and enhance our cruise products and services to make them even more attractive to our Chinese guests. 

With 99 ships and more than 10.8 million guests in 2015 , we have the scale to optimize our structure by utilizing our combined purchasing volumes and common technologies as well as implementing cross-brand initiatives aimed at cost containment. We have established global leadership positions for communications, guest experience, maritime, procurement, revenue management and strategy to increase collaboration and communication across our brands and help coordinate our global efforts and initiatives. In addition, we are integrating certain back office functions to achieve the full benefits of our scale. 

We are building new, innovative, purpose-built ships that are larger with a greater number of balconies, more fuel efficient and have a wider range of onboard amenities and features. These ships enable us to better compete with other vacation options for consumers&#8217; vacation spend while achieving greater economies of scale resulting in improving returns on invested capital. As of January 22, 2016, we have a total of 17 cruise ships scheduled to be delivered between 2016 and 2020. Some of these ships will replace existing capacity as less efficient ships exit our fleet. Since 2006, we have removed 17 ships from our fleet and will remove one more ship in March 2016. We have a disciplined, measured approach to capacity growth so that we achieve an optimal balance of supply and demand to maximize our profitability. We continue to make substantial investments in our existing ship enhancement programs to improve our onboard product offerings and enrich our guests&#8217; vacation experiences. 

Our vision is based on four key pillars that are linked to each other: 

&#8226; 

Health, environment, safety, security and sustainability, 

&#8226; 

Guests, 

&#8226; 

Employees and 

&#8226; 

Shareholders and other stakeholders 

Health, Environment, Safety, Security and Sustainability 

We consider health, environment, safety, security and sustainability matters to be core guiding principles. Our uncompromising commitment to the safety and comfort of our guests and crew is paramount to the success of our business. We are committed to operating a safe and reliable fleet and protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and all others working on our behalf, thereby promoting an organization that is free of injuries, illness and loss. We continue to focus on further enhancing the safety measures onboard all of our ships. We are also devoted to protecting the environment in which our vessels sail and the communities in which we operate. We are dedicated to fully complying with, or exceeding, all relevant legal and statutory requirements related to health, environment, safety, security and sustainability throughout our business. See Part I, Item 1. Business. C. "Our Global Cruise Business" for further information. 

Guests 

Our goal is to consistently exceed our guests&#8217; expectations while providing them with a wide variety of exceptional vacation experiences. We believe that we can achieve this goal by continually focusing our efforts on helping our guests choose the cruise brand that will meet their unique needs and desires, improving their overall vacation experiences and building state-of-the-art ships with innovative onboard offerings and unequaled guest services. We are continuing to work on the next generation of innovative guest experiences so as to ensure we will be consistently exceeding our guest expectations. 

Employees 

Our goal is to recruit, develop and retain the finest shipboard and shoreside employees. A team of highly motivated and engaged employees is key to delivering vacation experiences that exceed our guests&#8217; expectations. Understanding the critical skills that are needed for outstanding performance is crucial in order to hire and train our crew and shoreside personnel. We believe in listening to our employees&#8217; perspectives and ideas and use employee feedback tools to monitor our progress in this area. We are a diverse organization and value and support our talented and diverse employee base. We also are committed to employing people from around the world and hiring them based on the quality of their experience, skills, education and character, without regard for their identification with any group or classification of people. 

Shareholders and Other Stakeholders 

We value the relationships we have with our shareholders and other stakeholders, including travel agents, communities, regulatory bodies, media, creditors, insurers, shipbuilders, governments and suppliers. We believe that engaging stakeholders in a mutually beneficial manner is critical to our long-term success and key for us to realize our vision. As part of this effort, we believe we must continue to be an outstanding corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate. Our brands work to meet or exceed their economic, environmental, ethical and legal responsibilities. 

Strong relationships with our travel agents are especially vital to our success. We continue to strengthen our relationship with the travel agent community by increasing our communication and outreach, implementing changes based on travel agent feedback and improving our educational programs to assist agents in stimulating cruise demand. 

B. Global Cruise Industry 

I. Overview 

The multi-night global cruise industry has grown significantly but still remains a relatively small part of the wider global vacation industry, which includes a large variety of land-based vacation alternatives around the world. Within the global vacation industry, cruise companies compete for the discretionary income spent by vacationers. A 2015 Nielsen Global Consumer Confidence Survey found that after providing for savings and living expenses, the number one global spending priority is for vacations. As a result of these and other favorable cruise industry characteristics, we believe that the global cruise industry has the opportunity to capture a greater share of consumers&#8217; spending. 

Cruising offers a broad range of products and services to suit vacationing guests of many ages, backgrounds and interests. Cruise brands can be broadly classified as offering contemporary, premium and luxury cruise experiences. The contemporary experience typically includes cruises that last seven days or less, have a more casual ambiance and are less expensive than premium or luxury cruises. The premium experience typically includes cruises that last from seven to 14 days and appeal to those who are more affluent and older. Premium cruises emphasize quality, comfort, style and more destination-focused itineraries, and the average pricing is normally higher than contemporary cruises. The luxury experience is usually characterized by smaller vessel size, very high standards of accommodation and service, higher prices and exotic itineraries to ports that are inaccessible to larger ships. We have product and service offerings in each of these three broad classifications. Notwithstanding these classifications, there generally is overlap and competition among all cruise products and services. 

II. Favorable Characteristics of the Global Cruise Industry 

a. Exceptional Value Proposition &#32; 

We believe that the cost of a cruise vacation represents an exceptional value in comparison to alternative land-based vacations. Cruising provides many relatively unique benefits, such as transportation to various destinations while also providing accommodations, a generous diversity of food choices and a selection of daily entertainment options for one all-inclusive, competitive price. To make cruising even more cost effective and more easily accessible to vacationers, the cruise industry typically offers a number of drive-to home ports, which enables many cruise guests to reduce their overall vacation costs by eliminating or reducing air and other transportation costs. 

b. Relatively Low Penetration Levels 

Based on industry data, the 2015 &#32;annual penetration rates when computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population are as follows (a): 

&#8226; 

4.0% for Australia and New Zealand, 

&#8226; 

3.4% for North America (b), 

&#8226; 

2.7% for the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) and 

&#8226; 

1.9% for continental Europe (c). 

(a) 

2015 &#32;annual penetration rates were computed based on the historical number of cruise guests carried for at least two consecutive nights obtained from G.P. Wild (International Limited) (&#8220;G.P. Wild&#8221;), an independent cruise research company and internal estimates. 

(b) 

For the purpose of the penetration rate calculation, North America is comprised of the United States of America (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and Canada. 

(c) 

For the purpose of the penetration rate calculation, continental Europe includes Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal. 

Cruising in China is in the early stages of development. Over the past decade China has been, by far, the world&#8217;s fastest growing tourism source area. With a growing middle class, almost 135 million Chinese tourists are expected to have traveled abroad in 2015 and it is expected to grow to 200 million by 2020. About 90% of Chinese outbound travel happens in Asia, with most destinations reachable by sea. We believe the cruise segment of the Chinese vacation region has significant long-term growth potential given its early stage of development with healthy demand from a large and growing middle-class population, the easing of travel restrictions and increasing support from the Chinese government. 

c. Wide Appeal 

Cruising appeals to a broad range of ages and income levels. Cruising provides something for every generation, from kids&#8217; clubs to an array of onboard entertainment designed to appeal to teens and adults. Cruising also offers transportation to a variety of destinations and a diverse range of ship types and sizes, as well as price points, to attract guests with varying tastes and from most income levels. To encourage first-time and repeat cruisers and better compete with other vacation alternatives the cruise industry has done, among other things, the following: 

&#8226; Expanded entertainment options, 

&#8226; Provided flexible dining options including open-seating dining, 

&#8226; Offered money-back guarantees, 

&#8226; Added more shipboard attractions, 

&#8226; Added branded specialty restaurants, bars and caf&#233;s, 

&#8226; Enhanced internet and communication capabilities, 

&#8226; Refocused marketing efforts, 

&#8226; Enhanced training of travel agents and 

&#8226; Offered shorter cruises from a variety of home ports, 

&#8226; Collaborated with well-known brands to attract more families. 

d. Positive Demand Trends 

The average age of populations in established cruise regions is increasing. The average age of a cruise guest, which varies by brand, ranges from approximately 40 years to 60 years in established cruise regions. Between 2015 &#32;and 2025 , the number of people in the cruise business&#8217; primary age group of 45 years and older is expected to grow by 18 million, or 12%, in the U.S. and Canada, 13 million, or 9%, in the major Western European countries and 1.5 million, or 17%, in Australia. 

The baby boomer generation, or those born between 1946 and 1964, is the most active older population group in history. The youngest in this group, who are in their fifties, are typically experiencing their peak earning years. Some of the oldest in this group, who are in their late sixties, are defying traditional stereotypes by continuing to work, having more active lifestyles and enjoying multi-generational cruising. 

The fastest growing segment of the vacation industry is the millennial generation, or those born between 1980 and 2000. The millennial generation has surpassed the size of the baby boomers generation and now represents the largest generation size in history. The millennial generation has a strong desire for travel and shared experiences and should continue to offer growth to the vacation industry, especially as they evolve into more frequent travelers. 

Furthermore, many emerging international regions are experiencing growing economies and a rapid growth in middle-class consumers. As their earnings power and disposable income increase, these middle-class consumers are becoming more eager to 

purchase entertainment, travel and discretionary products and services. This demand growth provides the cruise industry the opportunity to expand its reach in these regions. 

We believe the cruise industry is well-positioned to take advantage of these positive demand trends. 

e. Ship Mobility 

The mobility of cruise ships enables cruise companies to move their vessels between regions in order to maximize profitability and to meet changing demand. For example, brands can change itineraries over time in order to cater to guest tastes or as general economic or geopolitical conditions warrant. In addition, cruise companies have the flexibility to reposition some of their capacity to areas with growing demand, such as China. We believe that this unique ability to move ships provides the cruise industry with a competitive advantage compared to other land-based vacation alternatives. 

f. High Guest Satisfaction Rates 

Cruise guests tend to rate their overall satisfaction with a cruise vacation higher than comparable land-based hotel and resort vacations. According to industry surveys, the cruise experience consistently exceeds expectations of repeat and first-time cruisers on a wide range of important vacation attributes, such as value and service levels. Cruising continues to receive high guest satisfaction rates because of the unique vacation experiences it offers, including visiting multiple destinations without having to pack and unpack, all-inclusive product offerings and state-of-the-art cruise ships with entertainment, relaxation and fun, all at an outstanding value. 

g. Favorable Supply Versus Demand Balance 

The cruise industry continues to maintain a disciplined, measured rate of growth in established source areas, such as North America and Western Europe, and is investing in emerging source areas, such as China, where it believes it has greater growth opportunities. In addition, less efficient cruise ships will continue to be retired from service as they reach the end of their economic lives, no longer provide guests with the vacation experiences that they desire or do not provide sufficient cash flows. We believe this favorable supply versus demand balance will continue to have a positive impact on the cruise industry&#8217;s ability to grow profitably.

&#32;&#32;&#32; III. Cruise Brands 

a. North America 

Carnival Cruise Line is a leader in contemporary cruising and operates 24 ships designed to provide fun and exceptional vacation experiences that appeal to a wide variety of consumers, all at an outstanding value. Founded in 1972, Carnival Cruise Line is one of the most recognizable brands in the cruise industry and carried over 4.5 million guests in 2015, the most of any individual cruise brand. Carnival Cruise Line identifies their target customers as &#8220;The Spirited&#8221; or those who like to live life to the fullest, look at the glass as half full, feel comfortable in their own skin and make their own fun.

VI. Cruise Pricing and Payment Terms 

Each of our cruise brands publishes prices for the upcoming seasons primarily through the internet, although published materials such as brochures and direct mailings are also used. Our brands have multiple pricing levels that vary by cruise line, category of cabin, ship, season, duration and itinerary. Cruise prices frequently change in a dynamic pricing environment and are impacted by a number of factors, including the number of available cabins for sale in the marketplace and the level of guest demand. Some cruise prices are increased due to higher demand. Conversely, some cruise prices are reduced through special promotions and early booking, past guest recognition and other programs. We are in the process of developing a state-of-the-art revenue management system that will ultimately enable our brands to further optimize pricing and inventory. In addition, we are implementing new initiatives to better coordinate and optimize our brands' global deployment strategies to maximize guest satisfaction and itinerary profits. 

Our bookings are generally taken several months in advance of the cruise departure date. Typically, the longer the cruise itinerary the further in advance the bookings are made. This lead time allows us to manage our prices in relation to demand for available cabins through the use of advanced revenue management capabilities and other initiatives, with the typical strategy of marketing our ships to fill them while achieving the highest possible overall net revenue yields. See &#8220;Key Performance Non-GAAP Financial Indicators&#8221; in our "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K for a discussion of net revenue yields. 

The cruise ticket price typically includes the following: 

&#8226; 

Accommodations, 

&#8226; 

Most meals, including snacks at numerous venues, 

&#8226; 

Access to amenities such as swimming pools, water slides, water parks, whirlpools, a health club, and sun decks, 

&#8226; 

Child care and supervised youth programs, 

&#8226; 

Entertainment, such as theatrical and comedy shows, live music and nightclubs and 

&#8226; 

Access to exclusive private islands and destinations. 

Our brands&#8217; payment terms generally require that a guest pay a deposit to confirm their reservation and then pay the balance due before the departure date. Our guests are subject to a cancellation fee if they cancel their cruise within a pre-defined period before sailing, unless they purchase a vacation protection package for the ability to obtain a refund. 

As a convenience to our guests, we offer to arrange air transportation to and from airports near the home ports of our ships. In 2015, approximately10% of our guests purchased air transportation from us. In addition, we charter aircraft to facilitate our g 

uests&#8217; travel to distant locations for some of our European brands&#8217; cruise itineraries. We also offer ground transfers from and to the airport near the ship&#8217;s home port as part of our transfer programs. 

VII. Seasonality 

Our revenues from the sale of passenger tickets are seasonal. Historically, demand for cruises has been greatest during our third quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months. This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher ticket prices and occupancy levels and, accordingly, the largest share of our operating income is earned during this period. The seasonality of our results also increases due to ships being taken out-of-service for maintenance, which we schedule during non-peak demand periods. In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours&#8217; revenue and net income is generated from May through September in conjunction with the Alaska cruise season. 

VIII. Onboard and Other Revenues 

Onboard and other activities are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee. In 2015, we earned 25% of our revenues from onboard and other revenue activities and services not included in the cruise ticket price including the following: 

&#8226; Substantially all liquor and some non-alcoholic beverage sales, 

&#8226; Casino gaming, 

&#8226; Internet and communication services, 

&#8226; Full service spas, 

&#8226; Shore excursions, 

&#8226; Gift shop sales, 

&#8226; Specialty themed restaurants, 

&#8226; Art sales and 

&#8226; Photo sales, 

&#8226; Laundry and dry cleaning services. 

We enhance our guests&#8217; onboard experiences and increase our onboard revenues by offering all-inclusive beverage packages, spa packages and specialty restaurants. We are also implementing initiatives to strengthen our onboard revenue programs, such as bar and casino programs. We use various marketing and promotional tools and are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting &#8220;cashless&#8221; transactions for the sale of these onboard and other products and services. As a convenience to our guests, all our brands allow their guests to pre-book, and in most cases, pre-pay certain of their onboard and other revenue-producing activities in advance of the cruise. 

We offer a variety of shore excursions at each ship&#8217;s ports-of-call that include beach experiences, general sightseeing, cultural tours, adventure outings and local boat rides. We typically utilize local operators who provide shore excursions with guides who speak the same languages as most of our shore excursion guests. For our sailings to destinations in Alaska, shore excursions are operated by our wholly owned company, Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, or provided by local independent operators. We also offer revenue-producing activities on the private islands and port destinations that we operate that include beach bars and restaurants, water sports, cabana rentals and chair lift and surf rider attractions. 

Our casinos are all owned and operated directly by us and are equipped according to the unique requirements of our individual brands, which are driven by the ships&#8217; itineraries and the market from which their guests are sourced. We offer a wide variety of slot and gaming machines and a diverse mix of both traditional and specialty table games designed to meet the desires of our guests. We have also developed marketing and promotional arrangements with land-based casino companies in order to increase the number of casino players onboard certain of our brands. The casinos are only open when our ships are at sea in international waters or when otherwise permitted by law. 

In conjunction with our cruise vacations, many of our cruise brands sell pre-and post-cruise land packages of one to four days that include guided tours, hotel accommodations and related transportation services. In Alaska and the Canadian Yukon, we utilize, to a large extent, our own hotel and transportation assets. Additionally, we earn revenues from various promotional and other programs with destination retailers, parking facilities, credit card providers and other destination-based incentives. 

IX. Marketing Activities 

Guest feedback and research support the development of our overall marketing and business strategies to drive demand for cruises and increase the number of first-time cruisers. We measure and evaluate key drivers of guest loyalty and their satisfaction with our products and services that provide valuable insights about guests&#8217; cruise experiences. We closely monitor our net promoter scores, which reflect the likelihood that our guests will recommend our brands&#8217; cruise products and services to friends and family. We also regularly initiate customer research studies among guests, travel agents, tour operators and others for input on business decisions that enhance our cruise products and services for our guests. 

With increased collaboration between our brands and access to vast databases of past guest information, we are able to perform psychographic segmentation studies that allow us to better understand our guests&#8217; needs, wants and expectations. The results of these studies shape how we communicate, advertise and refine the booking process, overall onboard experience, as well as post-cruise interactions. Our ability to identify the psychographic mix is a powerful differentiator, which allows us to guide guests to the right experiences with the appropriate brands and build advocates for life. 

Each of our brands has comprehensive marketing and advertising programs across diverse mediums to promote their products and services to vacationers and travel agents in their source areas. Each brand&#8217;s marketing activities are generally designed to reach a local region in the local language. We continue to expand our marketing efforts to attract new guests online by leveraging the reach and impact of digital marketing and social media. This helps us cultivate guests as advocates of our brands, ships, itineraries and onboard products and services. We also have blogs hosted by ship captains, cruise and entertainment directors, executive pursers and special guests. 

We continue with our multi-brand marketing initiative with print, digital, social and field marketing elements with the goal of inspiring consumers to purchase a cruise. In addition, we have tools and are implementing big data analytic solutions that will continue to enable us to perform customer segmentation analyses, evaluate our guests&#8217; decision making processes and identify new market growth opportunities to expand our customer base. We have implemented strategies to generate new demand by targeting new cruisers who typically vacation at land-based destinations. 

All of our cruise brands offer past guest recognition programs that reward repeat guests with special incentives such as reduced fares, gifts, onboard activity discounts, complimentary laundry and internet services, expedited ship embarkation and disembarkation and special onboard activities. 

X. Sales Relationships 

We sell our cruises mainly through travel agents and tour operators that serve our guests in their local regions. These parties typically sell cabins to individuals and groups and also charter full or partial ships. In China, we sell cruises to our Chinese-sourced guests by chartering our ships and packaging groups of cabins to travel organizations that have travel agent licenses authorized to sell outbound travel products in China. Our individual cruise brands&#8217; relationships with their travel agents are generally independent of each of our other brands. Our travel agent relationships are generally not exclusive and travel agents generally receive a base commission, plus the potential of additional commissions, including complimentary tour conductor cabins, based on the achievement of pre-defined sales volumes. During fiscal 2015, no controlled group of travel agencies accounted for 10% or more of our revenues. 

Travel agents are an integral part of our long-term cruise distribution network and are critical to our success. We utilize local sales teams to motivate travel agents to support our products and services with competitive sales and pricing policies and joint marketing and advertising programs. We also employ a wide variety of educational programs, including websites, seminars and videos, to train agents on our cruise brands and their products and services. 

All of our brands have internet booking engines to allow travel agents to book our cruises. We also support travel agent booking capabilities through global distribution systems. All of our cruise brands have their own consumer websites that provide access to information about their products and services to users and enable their guests to quickly and easily book cruises and other products and services online. These sites interface with brands&#8217; social networks, blogs and other social media sites, which allow them to develop greater contact and interaction with their guests before, during and after their cruise. We also employ vacation planners who support our sales initiatives by offering our guests one-on-one cruise planning expertise and other services. 

We are a customer service driven company and continue to invest in our service organization to assist travel agents and guests before, during and after their cruise. We believe that our support systems and infrastructure are among the strongest in the vacation industry. Our investment in customer service includes the development of employees, processes and systems. We continually improve our systems within the reservations and customer relationship management functions, emphasizing the continuing support and training of the travel agency community. 

&#160; 

XI. Employees 

Our shipboard and shoreside employees are sourced from over 100 countries. We employ an average of 82,200 crew members, including officers, onboard the 99 ships we currently operate, which excludes employees who are on a leave. Our shoreside operations have an average of 10,000 full-time and 2,400 part-time/seasonal employees. Holland America Princess Alaska Tours significantly increases its work force during the late spring and summer months in connection with the Alaskan cruise season, which seasonal employees are included above. We have entered into agreements with unions covering certain employees on our ships and in our shoreside hotel and transportation operations. We consider our employee and union relationships to be strong. The percentages of our shipboard and shoreside employees that are represented by collective bargaining agreements are 47% and 15%, respectively. 

We source our shipboard officers primarily from Italy, the UK, Holland, Germany and Norway. The remaining crew positions are sourced from around the world, with the largest contingent from the Philippines, Indonesia and India. We utilize a limited number of manning agencies to help locate and hire most of our shipboard employees. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;XII. Training 

Our cruise brands are committed to providing appropriate hotel and marine-related training to ensure that our shipboard crew, including officers, have the knowledge and skills to properly perform their jobs. We have a maritime training program for shipboard officers that includes two training facilities with one located in Almere, the Netherlands, known as the Center for Simulator Maritime Training (&#8220;CSMART&#8221;), and the other located in Rostock, Germany. Our goal is to be a leader in delivering high quality professional maritime training. Participants receive a maritime training experience that fosters critical thinking, problem solving, ethical decision making and skill development. These facilities have numerous bridge and engine room simulators that are used for training. We are investing over $90 million to build a new CSMART training and accommodation facility that will open in mid-2016. We expect to train annually more than 6,000 shipboard officers at this expanded facility. 

We have enhanced our Health, Environment, Safety &#38; Security ("HESS") Management System risk assessment and management capabilities by implementing shipboard quality assurance initiatives that will further strengthen bridge and engine control room resource management training and operational performance. We have also established the European Cruise Academy in Rostock, which offers advanced training certificates in the maritime sciences primarily related to the cruise business. 

We provide a diverse range of shoreside and shipboard training for our hotel staff before and after they join our ships to further enhance their skills. Specifically, we provide bar, entertainment, guest service, housekeeping, leadership, management and restaurant training. Depending on the brand, we will also provide our hotel staff with in-depth English, German and Italian language training. All our hotel staff also undergo extensive safety training and, depending on their position, will pursue advanced safety certifications. We partner closely with manning agencies to help provide this training in Manila, Philippines; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Mumbai, India. 

XIII. Information Technology 

With the increasing size and sophistication of cruise ships, the technologies employed to create guest experiences and operate ships have grown ever more complex and integrated. Our global information technology model is designed to contribute to exceeding expectations of our guests, crew, shoreside employees and other stakeholders. Our global technology model is focused on creating innovative platforms and solutions to create exceptional guest experiences while leveraging common technologies to drive process efficiency and effectiveness across our portfolio of brands. In order to achieve our goals, we are focusing on applications, connectivity, cybersecurity, infrastructure and innovation. In the area of cybersecurity, we are striving to provide consistent protection of guest, employee and company data and develop best practices and tools to combat threats and malicious activity. 

All of our brands are actively collaborating on our global information technology solutions, standards and processes. By aligning technology planning, infrastructure and applications, we continue to maximize the business value of our information 

technology investments by eliminating redundancies and driving synergies across the brands while identifying and leveraging best practices and establishing common standards. 

XIV. Supply Chain 

Our largest non-payroll operating expenditures are for fuel, food and beverages, repairs and maintenance including dry-docking, travel agency services, port facility utilization, advertising and marketing, transportation services, hotel and restaurant products and supplies, entertainment expenses and credit card fees. Our largest capital investments are for the construction of new ships and improvements to existing ships, including exhaust gas cleaning systems ("EGCS") and energy efficiency investments. 

Although we utilize a select number of suppliers for most of our food and beverages, communication services, air transportation services and hotel and restaurant products and supplies, most of these products and services are available from multiple sources at competitive prices. The use of a select number of suppliers enables us to, among other things, obtain volume discounts. We purchase fuel and port facility services at some of our ports-of-call from a limited number of maritime suppliers. Almost 54% of our fuel purchases are provided by seven suppliers. 

Our global procurement team continues to implement cost savings strategic initiatives including: 

&#8226; 

Reviewing our processes for purchasing food, beverages, hotel supplies, restaurant products and technical spares to identify synergistic opportunities and to negotiate more favorable commercial terms, 

&#8226; 

Combining warehousing facilities and optimizing logistics, 

&#8226; 

Negotiating company-wide contracts for port services and shore excursions and 

&#8226; 

Streamlining the use of manning agencies. 

We perform our major dry-dock and ship improvement work at dry-dock facilities in The Bahamas, Europe, the U.S., Canada, Singapore and Australia. At January 22, 2016, we have agreements in place for the construction of 17 cruise ships with three shipyards. We also purchase some of our repair, maintenance and refurbishment items from a limited number of maritime suppliers. We believe there are sufficient dry-dock and shipbuilding facilities and related suppliers to meet our anticipated repair, maintenance, ship improvement and newbuild requirements. 

XV. Insurance 

a. 

General 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance to cover a number of risks associated with owning and operating our vessels and other non-ship related risks. All such insurance policies are subject to coverage limits, exclusions and deductible levels. Insurance premiums are dependent on our own loss experience and the general premium requirements of our insurers. We maintain certain levels of deductibles for substantially all the below-mentioned coverages. We may increase our deductibles to mitigate future premium increases. We do not carry coverage related to loss of earnings or revenues from our ships or other operations. 

b. 

Protection and Indemnity (&#8220;P&#38;I&#8221;) Coverages 

Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&#38;I clubs, which are mutual indemnity associations owned by ship owners. 

We are members of two P&#38;I clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of P&#38;I clubs, known as the International Group of P&#38;I Clubs (the &#8220;IG&#8221;). The IG insures directly, and through broad and established reinsurance markets, a large portion of the world&#8217;s shipping fleets. Coverage is subject to the P&#38;I clubs&#8217; rules and the limits of coverage are determined by the IG. 

c. 

Hull and Machinery Insurance 

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of each of our ships for reasonable amounts as determined by management. The coverage for hull and machinery is provided by large and well-established international marine insurers. Most insurers make it a condition for insurance coverage that a ship be certified as &#8220;in class&#8221; by a classification society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (&#8220;IACS&#8221;). All of our ships are routinely inspected and certified to be in class by an IACS member. 

d. 

War Risk Insurance 

We maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as loss or damage to our vessels arising from war or war-like actions, including terrorist incidents. Items excluded from this coverage are claims arising from chemical, nuclear and biological attacks. Our primary war risk insurance coverage is provided by international marine insurers and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our two P&#38;I clubs. Under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage, which are typical for war risk policies in the marine industry, insurers can give us seven days&#8217; notice that the insurance policies will be cancelled. However, the policies can be reinstated at different premium rates. This gives insurers the ability to increase our premiums following events that they determine have increased their risk. 

e. 

Other Insurance 

We maintain property insurance covering our shoreside assets and casualty insurance covering liabilities to third parties arising from our hotel and transportation business, shore excursion operations and shoreside operations, including our port and related commercial facilities. We also maintain workers compensation, directors and officer&#8217;s liability and other insurance coverages. 

XVI. Cruise Ports and Destination Developments 

Our cruise brands provide guests with unique vacation experiences and additional home and transit ports through the development and management of new or enhanced cruise port facilities. Creating leading destinations as well as securing preferred ports enables us to grow demand and deliver unique experiences to our guests. Our involvement is usually in cooperation with governmental entities and local operators and typically includes providing development and management expertise and financial commitments that are connected to long-term port usage and preferential berthing agreements. However, sometimes we provide direct financial support or develop the port infrastructure ourselves, including the development and operation of mixed-use commercial properties. Commercial property lease revenues are included in other cruise revenues. We currently operate or are developing: 

&#8226; 

Leased or owned port facilities or have interests in joint ventures that operate leased or owned port facilities in Barcelona, Spain; Civitavecchia, Naples, Savona and Trieste, Italy; Juneau and Ketchikan, Alaska; Long Beach, California and Marseilles, France for the benefit of our cruise brands and 

&#8226; 

Leased or owned port facilities that we have developed as destinations in Cozumel, Mexico; Grand Turk, Turks &#38; Caicos Islands; Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic and Roat&#225;n, Honduras; as well as private island destinations in The Bahamas, Half Moon Cay and Princess Cays&#174;, principally for the benefit of our North America cruise brands. The facility in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, known as Amber Cove, is a new port destination strategically located in the central Caribbean cruise region and opened in October 2015. 

These destinations offer a variety of features, including shore excursions, cultural and historic exhibits, water sports, beaches, retail outlets and a variety of themed-dining options. 

In addition, we are involved with the development, enhancement and/or financing of government-owned and operated cruise port facilities in Cape Canaveral, Fort Lauderdale and Miami, Florida; Galveston, Texas; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City, New York; San Juan, Puerto Rico and St. Maarten, Kingdom of the Netherlands. 

XVII. Principal Joint Ventures 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;a. Cruise Ship Repair Facility 

We own a 40% interest in Grand Bahamas Shipyard Ltd. (&#8220;GBSL&#8221;) located in Freeport, Grand Bahamas. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (&#8220;RCCL&#8221;) also owns a 40% interest in GBSL and an unaffiliated entity owned by Grand Bahamas Port Authority shareholders owns the remaining 20%. We utilize this facility, as well as other ship repair facilities, for our regularly scheduled dry-dockings, ship improvement work and certain emergency repairs. During 2015, we had 10 ships serviced at this facility. In addition, unaffiliated cruise ships and other types of ships, such as cargo ships, oil and gas tankers and offshore units, are serviced at this facility. GBSL generated total revenues of over $150 million in 2015, with a large portion being derived from work on our cruise ships. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;b. Chinese Strategic Joint Venture 

In October 2015, we formed a strategic joint venture by partnering with state owned China State Shipbuilding Company and China Investment Corporation to launch a new cruise brand in the Chinese vacation region. Potential plans for the venture could include the purchase of both new and existing cruise ships to be home ported in China. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;XVIII. Sustainability 

We recognize that our reputation and success depend on having sustainable and transparent operations. Our commitment and actions to keep our guests and crew members safe and comfortable, protect the environment, develop and provide opportunities for our workforce, strengthen our stakeholder relations and enhance the port communities that our ships visit, as well as the communities where we work, are vital to our success as a business enterprise and reflective of our core values. We strive to be a company that people want to work for and to be an exemplary global corporate citizen. 

We voluntarily publish Sustainability Reports that address governance, commitments, stakeholder engagement, environmental, labor, human rights, society, product responsibility, economic and other sustainability-related issues and performance indicators. These reports, which can be viewed at www.carnivalcorp.com &#32;and www.carnivalplc.com &#32;were developed in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines established by the Global Reporting Initiative, the global standard for reporting on environmental, social and governance policies, practices and performance. We have been publishing Sustainability Reports since 2011. 

We help to create a higher standard of living and quality of life in our home communities and those that we visit. We often meet with local government leaders to discuss business and community planning and ways to interact sustainably. We also promote the local destinations, develop certain local ports and cruise terminals, provide emergency aid and support and make philanthropic donations in some of the communities that we operate. 

In September 2015, we announced new 2020 sustainability goals reinforcing our commitment to the environment, our guests, our employees and the communities in which we operate. We have established ten goals aimed at reducing our environmental footprint while enhancing the health, safety and security of our guests and crew members and ensuring sustainable business practices across our brands and business partners in three categories as follows: 

Environmental Goals 

&#8226; 

Reduce intensity of carbon dioxide equivalent ("CO 2 e") emissions from operations by 25% by 2020 relative to our 2005 baseline, 

&#8226; 

Continue to improve the quality of our emissions into the air by developing, deploying and operating exhaust gas cleaning systems ("EGCS") across our fleet, 

&#8226; 

Increase usage of ship-to-shore power connection capabilities, 

&#8226; 

Increase Advanced Wastewater Purification Systems coverage of our fleet capacity by 10 percentage points by 2020 relative to our 2014 baseline, 

&#8226; 

Continue to improve our shipboard operations' water use efficiency by 5% by 2020 relative to our 2010 baseline and 

&#8226; 

Continue to reduce waste generated by our shipboard operations by 5% by 2020 relative to our 2010 baseline. 

Health, Safety and Security Goals 

&#8226; 

Continue to build on our commitment to protect the health, safety and security of guests, employees and all others working on our behalf. 

Sustainable Workforce and Community Goals 

&#8226; 

Continue to build a diverse and inclusive workforce and provide all employees with a positive work environment and opportunities to build a rewarding career to further drive employee engagement, 

&#8226; 

Further develop and implement vendor assurance procedures ensuring compliance with Carnival Corporation &#38; plc's Business Partner Code of Conduct and Ethics and 

&#8226; 

Continue to work on initiatives and partnerships that support and sponsor a broad range of organizations for the benefit of the communities where we operate. 

Our environmental efforts are focused on, among other things, reducing emissions such as greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHGs&#8221;) (for example, carbon dioxide (&#8220;CO 2 &#8221;) or CO 2 e, sulfur oxides (&#8220;SOx&#8221;) and nitrogen oxide (&#8220;NOx&#8221;)). These emissions result from the combustion of the marine fuels consumed by our ships, which accounts for substantially all of our total GHG and other emissions. Accordingly, reducing fuel consumption continues to be an important company-wide initiative, which will continue 

to help reduce emissions. We will continue to implement our energy-saving and emission reduction strategy, which includes installing some of the best available energy and emission reduction technologies on our ships, such as: 

&#8226; Efficiency improvements in the areas of hull coating and designs, 

&#8226; More efficient pumps, ventilation and waste heat recovery systems, 

&#8226; Exhaust gas cleaning systems, 

&#8226; New itineraries, 

&#8226; More advance engine designs, 

&#8226; More efficient propeller designs, 

&#8226; More efficient LED lighting, 

&#8226; Reduction in ship speeds and 

&#8226; More efficient air conditioning, which is the second largest user of onboard energy after propulsion, 

&#8226; Increased energy use awareness and training. 

In addition, we are designing more energy efficient ships that will enter our fleet in the future, while continuing toward reducing the fuel consumption of our existing fleet. 

We had voluntarily set a goal of delivering a 20% reduction (per unit) from our 2005 baseline of CO 2 e emissions from shipboard operations by 2015. We achieved our goal one year ahead of schedule and have set a new goal to achieve a 25% CO 2 e emissions reduction (per unit) from our 2005 baseline by 2020. We measure our ability to use direct energy efficiently by calculating the amount of primary source energy we consume. Our ship fuel consumption and emission rates and our total ship fuel GHG emissions are as follows:

(a) 

We measure and report the ship fuel consumption rate in terms of grams of fuel per available lower berth kilometer (&#8220;ALB-KM&#8221;). This indicator enables us to make meaningful fuel consumption comparisons that take into account changes in fleet size, itineraries and passenger capacity. 

(b) 

We measure and report the ship fuel GHG emission rate in terms of grams of CO 2 e per ALB-KM. This indicator enables us to make meaningful GHG emission reduction comparisons that take into account changes in fleet size, itineraries and passenger capacity. 

(c) 

We measure SOx and NOx emission rates in terms of total kilograms (&#8220;Kg&#8221;) of emissions per nautical mile (&#8220;NM&#8221;). Using an emission rate normalized by distance traveled allows us to compare our pollutant reduction efforts over the reporting periods. 

(d) 

GHG emission data collection and calculations were performed in accordance with our GHG Inventory Management Plan, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") standard 14064-3:2006. 

(e) 

Information for 2015 is not available as of January 29, 2016. Percentage reduction presented is from 2008 to 2014. 

The rate of decrease in Total Ship Fuel GHG Emissions was offset by the 28% increase in capacity and remained essentially flat when comparing 2008 to 2015. 

As part of our sustainability strategy we have voluntarily reported our carbon footprint via the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) each year since 2007. The CDP rates companies on the depth and scope of their disclosures and the quality of their reporting. Our submission included details of our most recently compiled emissions data and reduction efforts, along with our completion of an independent, third-party verification of our GHG emissions inventory. In November 2015, we were awarded a position on the FTSE 350 and the S&#38;P 500 Climate Disclosure Leadership Index as a result of our disclosures and efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. We also disclose our water stewardship through the CDP water program. 

We also support The Nature Conservancy, which is one of the world&#8217;s leading conservation organizations, in their efforts to restore coral reefs, protect marine ecosystems and promote natural systems to help reduce the impact of storms and rising sea levels in coastal communities. All of our brands environmental management systems are certified in accordance with ISO 14001. 

XIX. Governmental Regulations &#32; 

a. Maritime Regulations 

1. General 

Our ships are regulated by numerous international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements that govern health, environmental, safety and security matters in relation to our guests, crew and ships. These requirements change regularly, sometimes on a daily basis, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited. If we violate or fail to comply with any of these laws, regulations, treaties and other requirements we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We are committed to complying with, or exceeding, all relevant maritime requirements. All of our ships, and the maritime industry as a whole, are subject to the maritime safety and security regulations established by the International Maritime Organization (&#8220;IMO&#8221;), a specialized agency of the United Nations, and its principal set of requirements as mandated through its International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (&#8220;SOLAS&#8221;). 

Our ships are registered, or flagged, in The Bahamas, Bermuda, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Panama and the UK, which are also referred to as Flag States. They are regulated by these Flag States through international conventions that govern health, environmental, safety and security matters in relation to our guests, crew and ships. Representatives of each Flag State conduct periodic inspections, surveys and audits to verify compliance with these requirements. In addition, we are subject to the decrees, directives, regulations and requirements of the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), the U.S. and more than 400 other international ports that our ships visit every year. 

Our ships are also subject to periodic class surveys, including dry-docking inspections, by ship classification societies to verify that our ships have been maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification societies and that recommended repairs have been satisfactorily completed. Class certification is one of the necessary documents required for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. Dry-dock frequency, for example, is a statutory requirement mandated by SOLAS. Our ships dry-dock once or twice every five years, depending on the age of the ship. Dry-docking, which requires that the ship be temporarily taken out-of-service, typically lasts for one or more weeks depending on the amount of work performed. Significant dry-dock work includes hull inspection and related activities, such as scraping, pressure cleaning and bottom painting, and maintenance of steering and thruster equipment, propulsion engines, stabilizers and ballast tanks. While the ship is out of the water in dry-dock, we also perform other repairs, maintenance and ship improvement work. To the extent practical, each ship&#8217;s crew including the hotel staff remain with the ship during the dry-dock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work or participate in occupational, safety or other training. 

As noted above, our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities, which is also referred to as Port State Control, in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor requirements applicable to each port, as well as with international requirements. Many countries have joined together to form regional port regulatory authorities. 

Our Boards of Directors have HESS Committees, which are currently each comprised of three independent directors. The principal function of the HESS Committees is to assist the boards in fulfilling their responsibility to supervise and monitor our health, environment, safety, security and sustainability related policies, programs and initiatives at sea and ashore and compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements. The HESS Committees and our management team review all significant relevant risks or exposures and associated mitigating actions. 

We continue to be committed to implementing appropriate measures to manage identified risks effectively. As part of our commitment, we have a Chief Maritime Officer, who is a retired Vice Admiral from the U.S. Navy, to oversee our global maritime operations, including maritime quality assurance and policy, shipbuilding, ship refits and research and development. To ensure that we are compliant with the legal and regulatory requirements and that these areas of our business operate in an efficient manner we continue to, among other things: 

&#8226; 

Provide regular health, environmental, safety and security support, training, guidance and information to guests, employees and others working on our behalf, 

&#8226; 

Develop and implement effective and verifiable management systems to fulfill our health, environmental, safety, sustainability and security commitments, 

&#8226; 

Perform regular shoreside and shipboard audits and take appropriate action when deficiencies are identified, 

&#8226; 

Report and investigate all health, environmental, safety and security incidents and take appropriate action to prevent recurrence, 

&#8226; 

Identify those employees responsible for managing health, safety, environment, security and sustainability programs and ensure that there are clear lines of accountability and 

&#8226; 

Identify the aspects of our business that impact the environment and continue to take appropriate action to minimize that impact. 

2. Maritime Safety Regulations 

The IMO has adopted safety standards as part of SOLAS, which apply to all of our ships. To help ensure guest and crew safety and security, SOLAS establishes, among other things, requirements for the following: 

&#8226; Vessel design, 

&#8226; Life-saving and other equipment, 

&#8226; Structural features, 

&#8226; Fire protection and detection, 

&#8226; Construction and materials, 

&#8226; Safe management and operation, 

&#8226; Refurbishment standards, 

&#8226; Security and 

&#8226; Radio communications, 

&#8226; Musters. 

All of our crew undergo regular safety training that meets or exceeds all international maritime regulations, including SOLAS requirements which are periodically revised. These requirements apply to existing ships and ships under construction. 

SOLAS requires implementation of the International Safety Management Code (&#8220;ISM Code&#8221;), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for passenger vessel operators. Under the ISM Code, vessel operators are required to: 

&#8226; 

Develop a Safety Management System (&#8220;SMS&#8221;) that includes, among other things, the adoption of safety and environmental protection policies setting forth instructions and procedures for operating vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies and protecting the environment. 

&#8226; 

Obtain a Document of Compliance (&#8220;DOC&#8221;) for the vessel operator, as well as a Safety Management Certificate (&#8220;SMC&#8221;) for each vessel they operate. These documents are issued by the vessel&#8217;s Flag State and evidence compliance with the SMS. 

&#8226; 

Verify or renew DOCs and SMCs periodically in accordance with the ISM Code. 

All of our shoreside and shipboard operations and ships are regularly audited by the national authorities and maintain the required DOCs and SMCs in accordance with the ISM Code. 

We continue to implement policies and procedures that demonstrate our continuing commitment to the safety of our guests and crew. These policies and procedures include the following: 

&#8226; 

Expansion and acceleration of training of our bridge and engine room officers in maritime related best practices at our training facilities in Almere, the Netherlands and Rostock, Germany, 

&#8226; 

Further standardization of our detailed bridge and engine resource management procedures on all of our ships, 

&#8226; 

Expansion of our existing oversight function to monitor bridge and engine room operations, 

&#8226; 

Identifying and standardizing best-practice policies and procedures in health, environment, safety and security disciplines across the entire organization including on all our ships and 

&#8226; 

Further enhancing our processes for auditing and continuously improving our HESS performance throughout our operations. 

As members of CLIA, we helped to develop and have implemented policies that are intended to enhance shipboard safety throughout the cruise industry. In some cases this calls for implementing best practices, which are in excess of existing legal requirements. These policies primarily relate to the following: 

&#8226; Location of lifejacket stowage, 

&#8226; Local sounding smoke alarms, 

&#160; 

&#8226; Harmonization of bridge procedures, 

&#8226; Reporting of crimes and missing persons, 

&#160; 

&#8226; Recording the nationality of passengers, 

&#8226; Safeguarding children in youth activity centers, 

&#160; 

&#8226; Common elements of passenger musters, 

&#8226; Security incidents, 

&#160; 

&#8226; Passage planning, 

&#8226; Waste management and 

&#160; 

&#8226; Personnel access to the bridge, 

&#8226; Medical facilities. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Lifeboat loading for training purposes, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Further details on these and other policies can be found on www.cruising.org . 

3. Maritime Security Regulations 

Our ships are subject to numerous security requirements. These requirements include the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, which is part of SOLAS, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, which addresses U.S. port and waterway security and the U.S. Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to all of our ships that embark or disembark passengers in the U.S. These regulations include requirements as to the following: 

&#8226; 

Implementation of specific security measures, including onboard installation of a ship security alert system, 

&#8226; 

Assessment of vessel security, 

&#8226; 

Efforts to identify and deter security threats, 

&#8226; 

Training, drills and exercises, 

&#8226; 

Security plans that may include guest, vehicle and baggage screening procedures, security patrols, establishment of restricted areas, personnel identification procedures, access control measures and installation of surveillance equipment and 

&#8226; 

Establishment of procedures and policies for reporting and managing allegations of crimes. 

4. Maritime Environmental Regulations 

We are subject to numerous international, national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and treaties that govern, among other things, air emissions, waste discharges, water management and disposal, and the storage, handling, use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. 

i. International Regulations 

The principal international convention governing marine pollution prevention and response is the IMO&#8217;s International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (&#8220;MARPOL&#8221;). MARPOL includes four annexes containing requirements designed to prevent and minimize both accidental and operational pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions. 

a. Preventing and Minimizing Pollution 

MARPOL sets forth specific requirements related to vessel operations, equipment, recordkeeping and reporting that are designed to prevent and minimize pollution. All of our ships must carry an International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate, an International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate, an International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate and a Garbage Management Plan. The ship&#8217;s Flag State issues these certificates, which evidence their compliance with the MARPOL regulations regarding prevention of pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions. Certain jurisdictions have not adopted all of these MARPOL annexes but have established various national, regional or local laws and regulations to apply to these areas. 

As noted above, MARPOL governs the prevention of pollution by oil from operational measures, as well as from accidental discharges. MARPOL requires that discharges of machinery space bilge water pass through pollution prevention equipment that separates oil from the water and monitors the discharge to ensure that the effluent does not exceed 15 parts per million of oil. Our ships must have oily water separators with oil content monitors installed and must maintain a record of certain engine room operations in an Oil Record Book. In addition, we have voluntarily installed redundant systems on all of our ships that monitor processed bilge water prior to discharge to ensure that it contains no more than 15 parts per million of oil. This voluntary system provides additional control to prevent improper bilge water discharges. MARPOL also requires that our ships have Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans. 

MARPOL also governs the discharge of sewage from ships and contains regulations regarding the ships&#8217; equipment and systems for the control of sewage discharge, the provision of facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage and requirements for survey and certification. 

MARPOL also governs the discharge of garbage from ships and requires a Garbage Management Plan and a Garbage Record Book. As a result of MARPOL regulations addressing garbage management, the discharge of all garbage to sea is prohibited unless the discharge is expressly permitted by these regulations. 

Furthermore, MARPOL addresses air emissions from vessels, establishes requirements for the prevention of air pollution from ships to reduce emissions of SOx, NOx and particulate matter. It also contains restrictions on the use of ozone depleting substances (&#8220;ODS&#8221;) and requires the recording of ODS use, equipment containing ODS and the emission of ODS. 

&#160; 

As a means of managing and improving our environmental performance and compliance, we adhere to standards set by ISO, an international standard-setting body, which produces worldwide industrial and commercial standards. The environmental management systems of our brands and ships are certified in accordance with ISO 14001, the environmental management standard that was developed to help organizations manage the environmental impacts of their processes, products and services. ISO 14001 defines an approach to setting and achieving environmental objectives and targets, within a structured management framework. 

&#160; 

b. Low Sulfur Fuel 

MARPOL Annex VI addresses air emissions from vessels in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on ships. Annex VI also specifies requirements for Emission Control Areas (&#8220;ECAs&#8221;) with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. Since January 2015, ships operating in the Baltic Sea ECA, the North Sea ECA, the North American ECA and the U.S. Caribbean ECA have been required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1% or use alternative emission reduction methods (&#8220;2015 ECA&#8221;). Since July 2015, ships operating in the port of Hong Kong were required to start using fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.5% or use alternative emission reduction methods. Lastly, since October 2015, ships operating at berth in the port of Sydney, Australia were required to start using fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1% or use alternative emission reduction methods; effective July 2016, this requirement will apply to ships operating anywhere within the boundaries of Sydney Harbor. 

The MARPOL global limit on fuel sulfur content outside of ECAs will be reduced to 0.5% on and after January 2020. This 0.5% global standard is subject to an IMO review by 2018 as to the availability of the required fuel oil to comply with this standard, taking into account the global fuel oil market supply and demand, an analysis of trends in fuel oil markets and any other relevant issues. If the IMO determines that there is insufficient fuel to comply with the 0.5% standard in January 2020, then this requirement will be delayed to January 2025, at the latest. However, the EU Parliament and Council have set 2020 as the final date for the 0.5% fuel sulfur content limit to enter force, regardless of the 2018 IMO review results. This EU Sulfur Directive will cover EU Member States&#8217; territorial waters that are within 12 nautical miles of their coastline. 

In conjunction with an affiliate we will continue to develop and test EGCS designs that will reduce the sulfur emission levels of our higher sulfur bunker fuel to or below the levels required under the ECA limits and the 2020 global limits. To allow us sufficient time to install EGCSs on a reasonable schedule, we received an exemption for 32 ships that regularly sailed within the North American and U.S. Caribbean ECAs that have delayed the requirements to comply with the 2015 ECA limit through agreed upon dates ending in 2016. As of November 30, 2015, EGCSs have been installed on 40 ships, including some of the ships operating under the exemption, and we expect to have them installed on 64 ships by the end of 2016. These efforts will mitigate the majority of the impact from the 2015 ECA. We have, and will, incur additional EGCS operating expenses as we benefit from the use of this technology. 

c. Other Emission Abatement Methods 

In the long-term, the cost impacts of achieving progressively lower sulfur emission requirements may be further mitigated by the favorable impact of future changes in the supply and demand balance for marine and other fuels, future developments of and investments in improved sulfur emission abatement technologies, the use of alternative lower cost and lower emission fuels and our continued efforts to improve the overall fuel efficiency across our fleet. Since 2007, we have achieved an almost 27% cumulative reduction in unit fuel consumption by focusing on the following: 

&#8226; Efficiency improvements in the areas of hull coatings and designs, 

&#8226; More efficient pumps, ventilation and waste heat recovery systems, 

&#8226; Improved engine performance, 

&#8226; New itineraries, 

&#8226; More advance engine designs, 

&#8226; More efficient propeller designs, 

&#8226; More efficient LED lighting, 

&#160;&#8226; Reduction in ship speeds and 

&#8226; More efficient air conditioning, which is the second largest user of onboard energy after propulsion, 

&#8226; Increased energy use awareness and training. 

As part of our emission abatement program, we have continued our work with local port authorities to help promote the development of shore power connections in Juneau, Alaska; Long Beach, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego, California; Brooklyn, New York; Halifax, Nova Scotia; Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia and have equipped 26 ships with the capability to utilize shore power technology. This technology enables our ships to use power from the local electricity provider rather than running their engines while in port to power their onboard services, and thus reducing our air emissions. Similarly, in an effort to continue our commitment to sustainability and to play a leading role in matters of environmental protection in the cruise industry, AIDA began using liquefied natural gas ("LNG") hybrid barge as an ecologically friendly and flexible power supply and an alternative to shore power, while its ships are moored in the port of Hamburg, Germany. 

We announced in 2015 that four next-generation cruise ships for Costa and AIDA will be the first in the industry to be powered at sea by LNG, one of the world&#8217;s cleanest burning fossil fuels. Pioneering a new era in the use of low carbon fuels, these new ships will use LNG to generate 100 percent of the ship&#8217;s power both in port and on the open sea - an innovation that will reduce exhaust emissions to help protect the environment. Additionally, AIDAprima which is expected to be delivered in early 2016 and her 2017 sister ship, will be the first cruise ships in the world that will regularly use dual-fuel engines for an energy supply with LNG while in port, along with a connection to shoreside power and an extensive filter system for the treatment of exhaust emissions. 

d. Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

In January 2013, the IMO approved measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions of GHGs from international shipping by adopting technical and operational measures for all ships. The technical measures apply to the design of new vessels, and the operational reduction measures apply to all vessels. Operational reduction measures have been implemented through a variety of means, including a Ship Energy Efficiency Plan, improved voyage planning and more frequent propeller and hull cleanings. We have established objectives within the ISO 14001 environmental management systems of each of our brands to further reduce fuel consumption rates and the resulting CO 2 e emission rates. 

&#160; 

ii. U.S. Federal and State Regulations 

The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships authorizes the implementation of MARPOL in the U.S. and imposes numerous requirements on our ships, as discussed above. Administrative, civil and criminal penalties may be assessed for violations. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA 90&#8221;) established a comprehensive federal liability regime, as well as prevention and response requirements, relating to discharges of oil in U.S. waters. The major requirements include demonstrating financial responsibility up to the liability limits and having oil spill response plans in place. We have Certificates of Financial Responsibility that demonstrate our ability to meet the maximum amount of OPA 90 related liability that our ships could be subject to for removal costs and damages, such as from an oil spill or a release of a hazardous substance. Under OPA 90, owners or operators of vessels operating in U.S. waters must file Vessel Response Plans with the U.S. Coast Guard and must operate in compliance with these plans. Our Vessel Response Plans have been submitted to the U.S. Coast Guard and we operate in accordance with our plans. As OPA 90 expressly allows coastal states to impose liabilities and requirements beyond those imposed under federal law, many U.S. states have enacted laws more stringent than OPA 90. Some of these state laws impose unlimited liability for oil spills and contain more stringent financial responsibility and contingency planning requirements. 

The Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;) provides the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) with the authority to regulate commercial vessels&#8217; incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations within the U.S. three mile territorial sea and inland waters. 

Pursuant to the CWA authority, the U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System was designed to minimize pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the requirements are laid out in EPA's Vessel General Permit (&#8220;VGP&#8221;) for discharges incidental to the normal operations of vessels. The VGP establishes effluent limits for 27 specific discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. In addition to these discharge and vessel specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and record-keeping. Our vessels have coverage under the VGP and thus are subject to its requirements. 

We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the transportation and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are generated by our ships. In general, vessel owners are required to determine if their wastes are hazardous, comply with certain standards for the proper management of hazardous wastes and use hazardous waste manifests for shipments to approved disposal facilities. 

The U.S. National Invasive Species Act (&#8220;NISA&#8221;) was enacted in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into U.S. waters through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign waters. The U.S. Coast Guard adopted regulations under NISA that impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters. These requirements can be met by performing mid-ocean ballast exchange, by retaining ballast water onboard the vessel or by using environmentally sound ballast water treatment methods approved by the U.S. Coast Guard. 

&#160; 

Most U.S. states that border navigable waterways or sea coasts have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and in some cases have no statutory limits of liability. 

The state of Alaska has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated Alaskan waters and sets effluent limits on others. Further, the state requires that certain discharges be reported and monitored to verify compliance with the standards established by the legislation. Both the state and federal environmental regimes in Alaska are more stringent than the U.S. federal requirements with regard to discharge from vessels in other areas. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters. The state of California also has environmental requirements significantly more stringent than the federal requirements. 

iii. EU Regulations 

The EU has adopted a broad range of substantial environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment for European citizens and providing them with a high quality of life. To support the implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the EU has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement and a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections. 

The European Commission&#8217;s (&#8220;EC&#8221;) strategy is to reduce atmospheric emissions from ships. The EC strategy seeks to implement SOx Emission Control Areas set out in MARPOL, as discussed below. In addition, the EC goes beyond the IMO by requiring the use of low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil while in EU ports. 

5. Maritime Health Regulations 

We are committed to providing a healthy environment for all of our guests and crew. We collaborate with public health inspection programs throughout the world, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) and the SHIPSAN Project in the EU to ensure that development of these programs leads to enhanced health and hygiene onboard our ships. Through our collaborative efforts, we work with the authorities to develop and revise guidelines, review plans and conduct on-site inspections for all newbuilds and significant ship renovations. In addition, we continue to maintain our ships by meeting, and often exceeding, applicable public health guidelines and requirements, complying with inspections, reporting communicable illnesses and conducting regular crew training and guest education programs. 

In 2014, 11.3 million passengers embarked on CLIA member cruise ships from U.S. ports. That year, there were eight reportable norovirus outbreaks on cruise ships departing from U.S. ports involving a total of 1,547 passengers, which represents only 0.014% of cruise passengers on CLIA member cruise ships. By contrast, the CDC reported there are approximately 20 million norovirus cases in a typical year in the U.S., or 6.3% of the U.S. population. It is estimated that 1 in 15 Americans contract the norovirus on land each year, compared to an estimated 1 in 12,000 cruise guests who report that they have contracted the norovirus on a cruise ship during an outbreak each year. Although outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses on ships 

represent a small percentage of all outbreaks, the cruise industry has developed and implemented policies and practices to limit gastrointestinal illness onboard ships. 

6. Maritime Labor Regulations 

In 2006, the International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor 

standards, adopted a Consolidated Maritime Labor Convention (&#8220;MLC 2006&#8221;). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards and includes a broad range of requirements, such as the definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. In August 2013, MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries in which we operate. 

The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, as amended, establishes minimum standards relating to training, including security training, certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers. 

b. Consumer Regulations 

In most major countries where we source our guests, we are required to establish financial responsibility, such as obtaining a guarantee from a reputable insurance company to ensure that, in case of insolvency, our guests will be refunded their deposits and repatriated without additional cost if insolvency occurs after a cruise starts. 

In Australia and most of Europe, we are also obligated to honor our guests&#8217; cruise payments made by them to their travel agents and tour operators regardless of whether we receive these payments. 

c. Guests with Disabilities Regulations 

Regulations regarding ship accessibility standards are expected to be issued in the U.S. As a result of the proposed new regulations, we expect that we will be required to make modifications to some of our ships but do not believe the cost of these will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

XX. Taxation 

A summary of our principal taxes and exemptions in the jurisdictions where our significant operations are located is as follows: 

a. 

U.S. Income Tax 

We are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the business of operating cruise ships in international transportation. We also own and operate, among other businesses, the U.S. hotel and transportation business of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours through U.S. corporations. 

Our North American cruise ship businesses and certain ship-owning subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. Depending on its itinerary, any particular ship may generate income from sources within the U.S. We believe that our U.S. source income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, to the extent derived from, or incidental to, the international operation of a ship or ships, is currently exempt from U.S. federal income and branch profit taxes. 

Our domestic U.S. operations, principally the hotel and transportation business of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, are subject to federal and state income taxation in the U.S. 

1. 

Application of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code 

In general, under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain non-U.S. corporations (such as our North American cruise ship businesses) are not subject to U.S. federal income tax or branch profits tax on U.S. source income derived from, or incidental to, the international operation of a ship or ships. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide in general that a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part, (i) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the U.S. (an &#8220;equivalent exemption jurisdiction&#8221;) and (ii) the foreign corporation meets a defined publicly-traded test. Subsidiaries of foreign corporations that are organized in an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and meet the publicly-traded test also benefit from Section 883. We believe that Panama is an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and Carnival Corporation currently qualifies as a publicly-traded corporation under the regulations. Accordingly, substantially all of Carnival Corporation&#8217;s income is exempt from U.S. federal income and branch profit taxes. 

Regulations under Section 883 list items that the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) does not consider to be incidental to ship operations. Among the items identified as not incidental are income from the sale of air transportation, transfers, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise land packages to the extent earned from sources within the U.S. 

2. 

Exemption Under Applicable Income Tax Treaties 

We believe that the U.S. source transportation income earned by Carnival plc and its Italian resident subsidiary currently qualifies for exemption from U.S. federal income tax under applicable bilateral U.S. income tax treaties. 

3. 

U.S. State Income Tax 

Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and certain of their subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes generally imposed on each state&#8217;s portion of the U.S. source income subject to U.S. federal income taxes. However, the state of Alaska imposes an income tax on its allocated portion of the total income of our companies doing business in Alaska and certain of their subsidiaries. 

b. 

UK and Australian Income Tax 

Cunard, P&#38;O Cruises (UK) and P&#38;O Cruises (Australia) are divisions of Carnival plc and have elected to enter the UK tonnage tax under a rolling ten-year term and, accordingly, reapply every year. Companies to which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation taxes on profits calculated by reference to the net tonnage of qualifying ships. UK corporation tax is not chargeable under the normal UK tax rules on these brands&#8217; relevant shipping income. Relevant shipping income includes income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. 

For a company to be eligible for the regime, it must be subject to UK corporation tax and, among other matters, operate qualifying ships that are strategically and commercially managed in the UK. Companies within UK tonnage tax are also subject to a seafarer training requirement. 

Our UK non-shipping activities that do not qualify under the UK tonnage tax regime remain subject to normal UK corporation tax. Dividends received from subsidiaries of Carnival plc doing business outside the UK are generally exempt from UK corporation tax. 

P&#38;O Cruises (Australia) and all of the other cruise ships operated internationally by Carnival plc for the cruise segment of the Australian vacation region are exempt from Australian corporation tax by virtue of the UK/Australian income tax treaty. 

c. 

Italian and German Income Tax 

In early 2015, Costa and AIDA re-elected to enter the Italian tonnage tax regime through 2024 and can reapply for an additional ten-year period beginning in early 2025. Companies to which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation taxes on shipping profits calculated by reference to the net tonnage of qualifying ships. 

Most of Costa&#8217;s and AIDA&#8217;s earnings that are not eligible for taxation under the Italian tonnage tax regime will be taxed at an effective tax rate of 5.5%. 

Substantially all of AIDA&#8217;s earnings are exempt from German income taxes by virtue of the Germany/Italy income tax treaty. 

d. 

Income and Other Taxes in Asian Countries 

Substantially all of our brands&#8217; income from their international operation in Asian countries is exempt from local corporation tax by virtue of relevant income tax treaties. 

e. 

Other 

In addition to or in place of income taxes, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose taxes, fees and other charges based on guest counts, ship tonnage, passenger capacity or some other measure. 

XXI. Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

We own and have registered or licensed numerous trademarks and domain names, which we believe are widely recognized and have considerable value. These intangible assets enable us to distinguish our cruise products and services, ships and programs from those of our competitors. Our trademarks include the trade names of our cruise brands, each of which we believe is a widely-recognized brand in the cruise industry, as well as our ship names and a wide variety of cruise products and services.

Our principal cruise competitors are RCCL, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Ltd. (&#8220;NCL&#8221;) and MSC Cruises. RCCL and NCL each own several brands as follows: 

&#8226; 

RCCL owns Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara Club Cruises, CDF Croisieres de France and Pullmantur, 

&#8226; 

RCCL and TUI AG, the leading German tour operator, jointly own TUI Cruises, a German cruise competitor, 

&#8226; 

RCCL and Ctrip, a leading Chinese travel service provider, jointly own SkySea Cruises, a domestic Chinese cruise competitor and 

&#8226; 

NCL owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. 

Almost 90% of all 2014 global cruise guests sailed with these competitors and us.
