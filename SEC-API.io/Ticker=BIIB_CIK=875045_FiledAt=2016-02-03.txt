&#160;

Humanitarian Aid 

In 2014, we and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi) began working with the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) to help people with hemophilia in the developing world through our pledge to donate up to one billion international units (IUs) of clotting factor therapy for humanitarian use, of which up to 500 million IUs will be donated to WFH USA over a period of five years. In 2015, we made the first shipments of hemophilia therapy to WFH USA. 

Product/Pipeline Developments 

Multiple Sclerosis 

ZINBRYTA (daclizumab high yield process) 

l 

In March 2015, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated our marketing authorization application (MAA) for ZINBRYTA for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in the European Union (E.U.). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In April 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted our Biologics License Application (BLA) for ZINBRYTA for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in the United States (U.S.). 

TYSABRI (natalizumab) 

l 

In July 2015, the results of ACTION, our Phase 2 trial investigating TYSABRI in acute ischemic stroke, did not demonstrate an impact on change in infarct volume, the primary endpoint. Exploratory endpoints suggested that TYSABRI had a beneficial impact on patient functional deficits. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In October 2015, the results of ASCEND, our Phase 3 study evaluating TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS (SPMS), did not achieve its primary and secondary endpoints, and the development of TYSABRI in SPMS was discontinued. 

Anti-LINGO 

l 

In January 2015, we announced top-line results from RENEW, our Phase 2 acute optic neuritis trial. 

Hemophilia 

ELOCTATE &#160; [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] 

l 

In November 2015, the European Commission (EC) approved ELOCTA, the approved trade name for ELOCTATE in the E.U., for the treatment of hemophilia A. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

Sobi has assumed final development and commercialization of ELOCTA in their territory, which essentially includes Europe, North Africa, Russia, and certain markets in the Middle East (Sobi Territory). 

ALPROLIX &#160; [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein]

In June 2015, the EMA validated our MAA for ALPROLIX for the treatment of hemophilia B. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In July 2015, Sobi exercised its option to assume final development and commercialization of ALPROLIX in the Sobi Territory. 

Neurodegeneration 

Aducanumab (BIIB037) 

l 

In March 2015 and July 2015, we announced data from pre-specified interim analyses of PRIME, our Phase 1b study of aducanumab. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In September 2015, we enrolled our first patient in our two global Phase 3 studies, ENGAGE and EMERGE, to assess the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in people with early Alzheimer's disease. In October 2015, we announced that we received FDA agreement on a special protocol assessment on the Phase 3 study protocols. Such agreement constitutes FDA&#8217;s concurrence on the design and size of the clinical trials which will form the basis for approval of aducanumab. 

Other Programs 

Nusinersen (ISIS-SMN Rx ) 

l 

In June 2015, our collaborator, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ionis), formerly known as Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., announced additional data from two Phase 2 studies of nusinersen for the treatment of SMA in infants and children. There are two ongoing Phase 3 studies of nusinersen.

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In September 2015, the Roche Group announced positive results from a Phase 3 study evaluating ocrelizumab in people with primary progressive MS (PPMS). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

Under our agreement with Genentech, if ocrelizumab is approved, we will receive tiered royalty payments on sales of ocrelizumab. 

Biosimilars (Samsung Bioepis - Biogen's Joint Venture with Samsung Biologics) 

BENEPALI 

l 

In November 2015, Samsung Bioepis received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the MAA for BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL. In January 2016, the EC approved the MAA for BENEPALI for marketing in the E.U. Under our agreement with Samsung Bioepis, we will manufacture and commercialize BENEPALI in specified E.U. countries. 

FLIXABI 

l 

In March 2015, the EMA validated and accepted Samsung Bioepis&#8217; MAA for FLIXABI, an infliximab biosimilar candidate referencing REMICADE. 

Discontinued Programs 

l 

During 2015, we discontinued several programs, including our study of Neublastin in neuropathic pain, our Phase 3 program for TECFIDERA in SPMS, our Phase 3 program evaluating TYSABRI in SPMS, the development of anti-TWEAK in lupus nephritis, and certain activities in immunology and fibrosis research.

Selected Financial Data and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report. A discussion of the risks attendant to our operations is set forth in the &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; section of this report. 

Multiple Sclerosis 

We develop, manufacture and market a number of products designed to treat patients with MS. MS is a progressive neurological disease in which the body loses the ability to transmit messages along nerve cells, leading to a loss of muscle control, paralysis and, in some cases, death. Patients with active relapsing MS experience an uneven pattern of disease progression characterized by periods of stability that are interrupted by flare-ups of the disease after which the patient returns to a new baseline of functioning. Our MS products and major markets include:

Hemophilia 

We develop, manufacture and market products designed to treat patients with hemophilia A and B. Hemophilia A is caused by having substantially reduced or no Factor VIII activity and hemophilia B is caused by having substantially reduced or no Factor IX activity, each of which is needed for normal blood clotting. People with hemophilia A and B experience bleeding episodes that may cause pain, irreversible joint damage and life-threatening hemorrhages. Prophylactic infusions of Factor VIII or Factor IX, as applicable, temporarily replace clotting factor necessary to control bleeding and help protect against new bleeding episodes. 

Our products for hemophilia and major markets include:

Marketing and Distribution 

Sales Force and Marketing 

We promote our products worldwide, including in the U.S., most of the major countries of the E.U. and Japan, primarily through our own sales forces and marketing groups. In some countries, particularly in areas where we continue to expand into new geographic areas, we partner with third parties. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on specialist physicians in private practice or at major medical centers. We use customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our products and to educate physicians, such as sales representatives calling on individual physicians, advertisements, professional symposia, direct mail, public relations and other methods. 

Distribution Arrangements 

We distribute our products in the U.S. principally through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service providers. In other countries, the distribution of our products varies from country to country, including through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and third-party distribution partners who are responsible for most marketing and distribution activities. 

RITUXAN and GAZYVA are marketed and distributed by the Roche Group and its sublicensees. 

Our product sales to two wholesale distributors, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson, each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , and on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 60% of our gross product revenues for such years, respectively. For additional information, please read Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 

&#160;

Patient Support and Access &#32; 

We interact with patients, advocacy organizations and healthcare societies in order to gain insights into unmet needs. The insights gained from these engagements help us support patients with services, programs and applications that are designed to help patients lead better lives. Among other things, we provide customer service and other related programs for our products, such as disease and product specific websites, insurance research services and order, delivery and fulfillment services. 

We are dedicated to helping patients obtain access to our therapies. Our patient representatives have access to a comprehensive suite of financial assistance tools. With those tools, we help patients and their caregivers and healthcare professionals understand, compare and select insurance options and programs that are available to them. In the U.S., we have established programs that provide qualified uninsured or underinsured patients with marketed products at no or reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria. We also provide charitable contributions that may assist eligible commercially-insured patients with out-of-pocket expenses associated with their costs for our products. 

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights 

Patents are important to obtaining and protecting exclusive rights in our products and product candidates. We regularly seek patent protection in the U.S. and in selected countries outside the U.S. for inventions originating from our research and development efforts. In addition, we license rights to various patents and patent applications. 

U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application was filed; however, U.S. patents that issue on applications filed before June 8, 1995 may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20 year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic or, in the case of the U.S., because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays in prosecuting the application. Specifically, in the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to five years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The duration and extension of the term of foreign patents varies, in accordance with local law. For example, supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) on some of our products have been granted in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval. 

Regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, also can provide meaningful protection for our products. Regulatory data protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization, for a set period of time, the exclusive use of the proprietary pre-clinical and clinical data that it created at significant cost and submitted to the applicable regulatory authority to obtain approval of its product. After the applicable set period of time, third parties are then permitted to rely upon our data to file for approval of their abbreviated applications for, and to market (subject to any applicable market protection), their generic drugs and biosimilars referencing our data. Market protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization the exclusive right to commercialize its product for a set period of 

&#160;

time, thereby preventing the commercialization of another product containing the same active ingredient(s) during that period. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) requires signatory countries to provide regulatory exclusivity to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and enforcement varies widely from country to country. 

&#32;&#32;We also rely upon other forms of unpatented confidential information to remain competitive. We protect such information principally through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers. In the case of our employees, these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, that inventions and other intellectual property conceived by such employees during their employment shall be our exclusive property. 

Our trademarks are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations in the USPTO and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. We also use trademarks licensed from third parties, such as the trademark FAMPYRA which we license from Acorda. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms. 

Our Patent Portfolio 

The following table describes our patents in the U.S. and Europe that we currently consider of primary importance to our marketed products, including the territory, patent number, general subject matter and expected expiration dates. Except as otherwise noted, the expected expiration dates include any granted patent term extensions and issued SPCs. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to, among other things, particular forms or compositions, methods of manufacturing, or use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. We also continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the patents listed in the table.

The existence of patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes, such as those that cover our existing compounds, products and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patents, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights covering our products by manufacturers of generics and biosimilars. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights is set forth in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; &#32;section of this report, and a discussion of legal proceedings related to certain patents described above are set forth in Note 20, Litigation &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 

Competition 

Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and comes from many sources, including specialized biotechnology firms and large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors are working to develop products similar to those we are developing or already market and have considerable experience in undertaking clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approval to market pharmaceutical products. Certain of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing and research and development resources than we do. 

We believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on managerial and technological excellence and innovation as well as establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximize the approval, acceptance and use of products resulting from research and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive within the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel. 

Competition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, convenience/delivery devices, reliability, availability and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have an important impact on our competitive position. 

The introduction of new products or technologies, including the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products may result in increased competition for our marketed products or could result in pricing pressure on our products. It is also possible that the development of new or improved treatment options or standards of care or cures for the diseases our products treat could reduce or eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. We may also face increased competitive pressures as a result of generics and the emergence of biosimilars in the U.S. and E.U. If a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products were approved, it could reduce our sales of that product. 

&#160;

Additional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below. 

TECFIDERA, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY and TYSABRI 

TECFIDERA, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY and TYSABRI each compete with one or more of the following products:

Competition in the MS market is intense. Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete with our MS products. One such product candidate is ocrelizumab, a potential treatment for PPMS being developed by the Roche Group. While we have a financial interest in ocrelizumab, future sales of our MS products may be adversely affected by the commercialization of ocrelizumab, as well as by other MS products we or our competitors are developing . Future sales may also be negatively impacted &#32; by &#32; the introduction of generics, prodrugs of existing therapeutics or biosimilars of existing products. 

FAMPYRA 

FAMPYRA is indicated as a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with MS who have walking disability and is the first treatment that addresses this unmet medical need with demonstrated efficacy in people with all types of MS. FAMPYRA is currently the only therapy approved to improve walking in patients with MS. 

ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX 

ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX compete with recombinant Factor VIII and IX products, respectively, including:

RITUXAN and GAZYVA compete with a number of therapies in the oncology market, including TREANDA (bendamustine HCL), ARZERRA (ofatumumab), IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) and ZYDELIG (idelalisib). 

We also expect that over time GAZYVA will increasingly compete with RITUXAN in the oncology market. In addition, we are aware of other anti-CD20 molecules, including biosimilars, in development that, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with RITUXAN and GAZYVA in the oncology market. 

RITUXAN in Rheumatoid Arthritis 

RITUXAN competes with several different types of therapies in the rheumatoid arthritis market, including, among others, traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as steroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine, TNF inhibitors, ORENCIA (abatacept), ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) and XELJANZ (tofacitinib). 

We are also aware of other products, including biosimilars, in development that, if successfully developed and approved, may compete with RITUXAN in the rheumatoid arthritis market. 

FUMADERM 

FUMADERM competes with several different types of therapies in the psoriasis market within Germany, including oral systemics such as methotrexate and cyclosporine. 

Research and Development Programs 

A commitment to research is fundamental to our mission. Our research efforts are focused on better understanding the underlying biology of diseases so we can discover and deliver treatments that have the potential to make a real difference in the lives of patients with high unmet medical needs. By applying our expertise in biologics and our growing capabilities in small molecule, antisense, gene therapy, gene editing and other technologies, we target specific medical needs where we believe new or better treatments are needed. 

We intend to continue committing significant resources to research and development opportunities. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and technologies and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels. 

&#160;

The table below highlights our current research and development programs that are in clinical trials and the current phase of such programs. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in the &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; section of this report.

Late Stage Product Candidates 

Additional information about our late stage product candidates, which includes programs in Phase 3 development or in registration stage, is set forth below. 

Multiple Sclerosis 

ZINBRYTA (daclizumab high yield process) 

l 

ZINBRYTA is a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of RRMS. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In June 2014, we announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 DECIDE clinical trial, which investigated ZINBRYTA as a potential once-monthly, subcutaneous treatment for RRMS. Results showed that ZINBRYTA was superior on the study's primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in annualized relapse rates when compared to interferon beta-1a. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

Our MAA for ZINBRYTA was validated by the EMA in March 2015, and the BLA was accepted by the FDA in April 2015. 

TYSABRI (natalizumab) 

l 

In May 2013, we completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study of TYSABRI in SPMS, known as ASCEND. The study had a duration of approximately two years and involved approximately 875 patients. SPMS is characterized by a steady progression of nerve damage, symptoms and disability. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In October 2015, the results of our Phase 3 ASCEND study did not achieve its primary and secondary endpoints, and the development of TYSABRI in SPMS was discontinued. 

Hemophilia 

ALPROLIX &#160; [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein] 

l 

In March 2014, ALPROLIX was approved by the FDA for the treatment of hemophilia B. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

Pediatric data was required as part of the MAA for ALPROLIX that we submitted to the EMA. In February 2015, we and Sobi announced positive top-line results of the Kids B-LONG Phase 3 clinical study that evaluated the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ALPROLIX in children under age 12 with severe hemophilia B. Following these results, we filed a MAA in the E.U., which was validated by the EMA in June 2015. 

Neurodegeneration 

Aducanumab (BIIB037) 

l 

In September 2015, we enrolled our first patient in our two global Phase 3 studies, ENGAGE and EMERGE. ENGAGE and EMERGE will assess the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in approximately 2,700 people with early Alzheimer's disease. The studies are identical in design and eligibility criteria. Each study will be conducted in more than 20 countries in North America, Europe and Asia. In October 2015, we announced that we received FDA agreement on a special protocol assessment on the Phase 3 study protocols. 

Other Programs 

Nusinersen (IONIS-SMN Rx ) 

l 

In August 2014, Ionis announced the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating nusinersen in infants with SMA, the most common genetic cause of infant mortality. This Phase 3 study, known as ENDEAR, is a randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled thirteen month study in approximately 110 infants diagnosed with SMA. The study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of a 12mg dose of nusinersen with a primary endpoint of survival or permanent ventilation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In November 2014, Ionis announced the initiation of a pivotal Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of nusinersen in non-ambulatory children with SMA. This Phase 3 study, known as CHERISH, is a randomized, double-blind, sham-procedure controlled fifteen month study in approximately 120 children with SMA. The study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of a 12mg dose of nusinersen with a primary endpoint of a change in the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded, a validated method to measure changes in muscle function in patients with SMA. 

Genentech Relationships 

GAZYVA (obinutuzumab) 

l 

The Roche Group is managing the following Phase 3 studies of GAZYVA: 

&#160; 

GOYA : investigating the efficacy and safety of GAZYVA in combination with CHOP chemotherapy compared to RITUXAN with CHOP chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 

&#160; 

GALLIUM : investigating the efficacy and safety of GAZYVA in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance with GAZYVA compared to RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance with RITUXAN in previously untreated patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

&#160; 

GADOLIN : investigating the efficacy and safety of GAZYVA plus bendamustine compared with bendamustine alone in patients with RITUXAN-refractory, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In February 2015, the Roche Group announced positive results from the Phase 3 GADOLIN study. At a pre-planned interim analysis, an independent data monitoring committee determined that the study met its primary endpoint early, showing that people lived significantly longer without disease worsening or death (progression-free survival) when treated with GAZYVA plus bendamustine followed by GAZYVA alone, compared to bendamustine alone. 

Ocrelizumab 

l 

In June 2015, the Roche Group announced positive results from two Phase 3 studies evaluating ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a in people with relapsing forms of MS. Treatment with ocrelizumab compared with interferon beta-1a significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate over a two-year period; significantly reduced the progression of clinical disability; and led to a significant reduction in the number of lesions in the brain as measured by MRI. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

l 

In September 2015, the Roche Group announced positive results from a Phase 3 study evaluating ocrelizumab in people with PPMS. Treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the progression of clinical disability compared with placebo, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale.

Regulatory 

Our current and contemplated activities and the products, technologies and processes that result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulation. 

Regulation of Pharmaceuticals 

Product Approval and Post-Approval Regulation in the U.S. 

APPROVAL PROCESS 

Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA requires companies to register both pre-approval and post-approval clinical trials and disclose clinical trial results in public databases. Failure to register a trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties. Clinical trial programs must establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and dosing regimen, and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or a New Drug Application (NDA). In response to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. 

&#160;

Product development and receipt of regulatory approval takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, potential safety signals observed in preclinical or clinical tests, and the risks and benefits of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The agency may require the sponsor of a BLA or NDA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delay or expense. Furthermore, even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA's interpretation of the existing pre-clinical or clinical data. The FDA has developed four distinct approaches intended to make therapeutically important drugs available as rapidly as possible, especially when the drugs are the first available treatment or have advantages over existing treatments: accelerated approval, fast track, breakthrough therapy, and priority review. 

&#8226; 

Accelerated Approval : The FDA may grant &#8220;accelerated approval&#8221; status to products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate endpoints, or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit. Under the agency's accelerated approval regulations, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require certain post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. In addition, for products approved under accelerated approval, sponsors may be required to submit all copies of their promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least thirty days prior to initial dissemination. The FDA may withdraw approval under accelerated approval after a hearing if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify any clinical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its safe use, or if a sponsor fails to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval. 

&#8226; 

Fast Track Status : The FDA may grant &#8220;fast track&#8221; status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product's development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, eligibility for accelerated approval, and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of a NDA or BLA for FDA review before the entire filing is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval. 

&#8226; 

Breakthrough Therapy : The FDA may grant &#8220;breakthrough therapy&#8221; status to drugs designed to treat, alone or in combination with another drug or drugs, a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary evidence suggests a substantial improvement over existing therapies. Such drugs need not address an unmet need, but are nevertheless eligible for expedited review if they offer the potential for an improvement. Breakthrough therapy status entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent meetings with the FDA regarding the development of nonclinical and clinical data and permits the FDA to offer product development or regulatory advice for the purpose of shortening the time to product approval. Breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee that a product will be developed or reviewed more quickly and does not ensure FDA approval. 

&#8226; 

Priority Review : Finally, the FDA may grant &#8220;priority review&#8221; status to products that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a NDA or BLA. 

&#160;

POST-MARKETING STUDIES 

Regardless of the approval pathway employed, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post-marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. If a sponsor fails to conduct the required studies, the agency may withdraw its approval. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it can mandate post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. In such a case, the sponsor may be required to establish rigorous systems to assure use of the product under safe conditions. These systems are usually referred to as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). The FDA can impose financial penalties for failing to comply with certain post-marketing commitments, including REMS. In addition, any changes to an approved REMS must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to implementation. 

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 

We monitor information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval and report such information and events to regulatory agencies. Non-compliance with the FDA's safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post-marketing studies (including additional clinical trials), or suspend or withdraw approval of the product. These requirements may affect our ability to maintain marketing approval of our products or require us to make significant expenditures to obtain or maintain such approvals. 

APPROVAL OF CHANGES TO AN APPROVED PRODUCT 

If we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of a new indication, we are required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for a use other than that initially approved. FDA regulatory review may result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes. 

REGULATION OF PRODUCT ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION 

The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities and communications for products under its jurisdiction both before and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the government. &#32; 

Regulation of Combination Products 

Combination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprising two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and a device). Biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. Some of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and similar regulations outside the U.S., and we expect that some of our pipeline product candidates may be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. 

Product Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Outside the U.S. 

We market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, where most of our ex-U.S. efforts are focused, there are several tracks for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the NDA or BLA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the EC. The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all member states. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products, and new 

&#160;

treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation. 

In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has: 

&#8226; 

a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; 

&#8226; 

a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and 

&#8226; 

a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision. 

Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection, and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC, and the marketing authorization holder. In some regions, it is possible to receive an &#8220;accelerated&#8221; review whereby the national regulatory authority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs. 

Good Manufacturing Practices 

Regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities, and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and product-specific regulations enforced by regulatory agencies following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions or remedies against us, including significant financial penalties and the suspension of our manufacturing operations. 

Good Clinical Practices 

The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the rights and welfare of trial participants are adequately protected (commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP)). Regulatory agencies enforce cGCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, contract research organizations (CROs), and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable cGCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial-related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with cGCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions. 

Approval of Biosimilars 

The Affordable Care Act amended the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to authorize the FDA to approve biological products, referred to as biosimilars or follow-on biologics, that are shown to be highly similar to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. The biosimilar must show it has no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety and effectiveness from the reference product, and only minor differences in clinically inactive components are allowable in biosimilars products. The approval pathway for biosimilars does, however, grant a biologics manufacturer a 12-year period of exclusivity from the date of approval of its biological product before biosimilar competition can be introduced. 

Biosimilars legislation has also been in place in the E.U. since 2003. In December 2012, guidelines issued by the EMA for approving biosimilars of marketed monoclonal antibody products became effective. In the E.U., biosimilars have been approved under a specialized pathway of centralized procedures. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the clinical trial data of an innovator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be &#8220;similar&#8221;. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full complement of clinical trials typically required for novel biologic drugs. 

&#160;

Orphan Drug Act 

Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a &#8220;rare disease or condition,&#8221; which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Legislation similar to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries to encourage the research, development and marketing of medicines to treat, prevent or diagnose rare diseases. In the E.U., medicinal products intended for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or very serious diseases affecting less than five in 10,000 people receive 10-year market exclusivity, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized procedure for marketing authorization. 

Regulation Pertaining to Pricing and Reimbursement 

In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third-party payors, including governments, private health plans and other organizations. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the pricing reimbursement of our products, and drug prices continue to receive significant scrutiny. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and pricing of our products to control cost or affect utilization of our products. The U.S. and foreign governments have enacted and regularly consider additional reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Other payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities, and private health insurers, seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value. 

Within the U.S. 

&#8226; 

Medicaid : Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. For most brand name drugs, the amount of the basic rebate for each product is set by law as the greater of 23.1% (17.1% for clotting factors and certain other products) of the average manufacturer price (AMP) or the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any customer (with limited exceptions). The rebate amount must be adjusted upward if AMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). This adjustment can cause the total rebate amount to exceed the minimum 23.1% (or 17.1%) basic rebate amount. The rebate amount is calculated each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS). The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program provides for civil monetary penalties. 

&#8226; 

Medicare : Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians or other health care practitioners; are provided in connection with certain durable medical equipment; or are certain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. In addition, clotting factors for hemophilia are typically paid under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (ASP) of the drugs. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide ASP information to the CMS on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer-submitted information is used to calculate Medicare payment rates. The current payment rate for Medicare Part B drugs is ASP plus 6%. The payment rates for drugs in the hospital outpatient setting are subject to periodic adjustment. The CMS also has the statutory authority to adjust payment rates for specific drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting 

&#160;

based on a comparison of ASP payment rates to widely available market prices or to AMP, which could decrease Medicare payment rates, but the authority has not yet been implemented. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties. 

Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. In addition, manufacturers, including us, are required to provide to CMS a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits. 

&#8226; 

Federal Agency Discounted Pricing : Our products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for our products to be covered and reimbursed by the Veterans Administration (VA), Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and Public Health Service (PHS). Coverage under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the VA, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties. 

&#8226; 

340B Discounted Pricing : To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, we are required to extend significant discounts to certain covered entities that purchase products under Section 340B of the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics, hemophilia treatment centers and other entities that receive certain types of grants under the PHSA. For all of our products, we must agree to charge a price that will not exceed the amount determined under statute (the &#8220;ceiling price&#8221;) when we sell outpatient drugs to these covered entities. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. The 340B discount formula is based on AMP and is generally similar to the level of rebates calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. 

Outside the U.S. 

Outside the U.S., the E.U. represents our major market. Within the E.U., our products are paid for by a variety of payors, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products. Governments may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Budgetary pressures in many E.U. countries are continuing to cause governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates, and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing. 

Regulation Pertaining to Sales and Marketing 

We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a prescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may be no regulations, guidance or court decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback or similar 

&#160;

laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. 

Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal &#8220;sunshine&#8221; provisions. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws. 

Other Regulations 

Foreign Anti-Corruption 

We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. 

The laws to which we are subject also include the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act) which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances. 

NIH Guidelines 

We seek to conduct research at our U.S. facilities in compliance with the current U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). By local ordinance, we are required to, among other things, comply with the NIH Guidelines in relation to our facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts and RTP, North Carolina and are required to operate pursuant to certain permits. 

&#160;

Other Laws 

Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to data privacy and protection, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to national or international antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted. 

Environmental Matters 

We strive to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning the environment. While it is impossible to predict accurately the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our operations or competitive position. 

Manufacturing 

We are committed to ensuring an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients around the world. To that end, we continually review our manufacturing capacity, capabilities, processes and facilities. We believe that our manufacturing facilities, together with the third-party contract manufacturing organizations we outsource to, currently provide sufficient capacity for our products and the contract manufacturing services we provide to Samsung Bioepis, our joint venture that develops, manufactures and markets biosimilars, and other strategic contract manufacturing partners. In light of the development of our pipeline, we have announced our plans to expand our production capacity by building a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Solothurn, Switzerland, which is expected to be operational by the end of the decade.

In addition to our drug substance manufacturing facilities, in August 2015, we expanded our capabilities by completing the purchase from Eisai of a drug product manufacturing facility and supporting infrastructure in RTP, North Carolina. This parenteral facility adds capabilities and capacity for filling biologics into vials. 

We also lease from Eisai an oral solid dose products manufacturing facility in RTP, North Carolina, where we manufacture TECFIDERA and other solid dose products, including products for Eisai. This facility supplements our outsourced small molecule manufacturing capabilities. Under our lease arrangement, Eisai may provide us with packaging services for oral solid dose products. In August 2015, we agreed to purchase this facility following the 

&#160;

expiration of our current three year lease in the third quarter of 2018. 

Genentech is responsible for all worldwide manufacturing activities for bulk RITUXAN and GAZYVA and has sourced the manufacture of certain bulk RITUXAN and GAZYVA requirements to a third party, and Acorda Therapeutics supplies FAMPYRA to us pursuant to its supply agreement with Alkermes, Inc. 

Third-Party Suppliers and Manufacturers &#32;&#32; 

We principally use third parties to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and to a lesser extent, the final product for our small molecule products and product candidates, including TECFIDERA and FUMADERM, and the final drug product for our large molecule products and product candidates. 

We source all of our fill-finish and the majority of final product assembly and storage operations for our products, along with a substantial part of our packaging operations, to a concentrated group of third-party contract manufacturing organizations. We have internal label and packaging capability for clinical and commercial products at our Cambridge and Hiller&#248;d facilities. Raw materials, delivery devices, such as syringes and auto-injectors, and other supplies required for the production of our products and product candidates are procured from various third-party suppliers and manufacturers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. Continuity of supply of such raw materials, devices and supplies is assured using a strategy of dual sourcing where possible or by a risk-based inventory strategy. Our third-party service providers, suppliers and manufacturers may be subject to routine cGMP inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions and undergo assessment and certification by our quality management group.

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 7,350 employees worldwide.
