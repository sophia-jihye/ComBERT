 Item 1 &#8212; Business 

General 

NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is an integrated competitive power company, which produces, sells and delivers energy and energy products and services in major competitive power markets in the U.S. while positioning itself as a leader in the way residential, industrial and commercial consumers think about and use energy products and services. NRG has one of the nation's largest and most diverse competitive generation portfolios balanced with the nation's largest competitive retail energy business. The Company owns and operates approximately 50,000 MW of generation; engages in the trading of wholesale energy, capacity and related products; transacts in and trades fuel and transportation services; and directly sells energy, services, and innovative, sustainable products and services to retail customers under the names &#8220;NRG&#8221;, "Reliant" and other retail brand names owned by NRG. NRG was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on May 29, 1992. 

Strategy 

NRG's strategy is to maximize stockholder value through the production and sale of safe, reliable and affordable power to its customers in the markets served by the Company, while positioning the Company to meet the market's increasing demand for sustainable, low carbon and customized energy solutions for the benefit of the end-use energy consumer. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to achieve substantial sustainable growth at reasonable margins while de-risking the Company in terms of reduced and mitigated exposure both to environmental risk and cyclical commodity price risk. At the same time, the Company's relentless commitment to safety for its employees, customers and partners continues unabated. 

To effectuate the Company&#8217;s strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) excellence in operating performance of its existing assets including repowering its power generation assets at premium sites and optimal hedging of generation assets and retail load operations; (ii) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial customers in competitive markets through multiple brands and channels with a variety of retail energy products and services differentiated by innovative features, premium service, sustainability, and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) investing in, and deploying, alternative energy technologies both in its wholesale portfolio through its wind and solar portfolio and, particularly, in and around its retail businesses and its customers as it transforms this part of its business into a technology-driven provider of retail energy services; and (iv) engaging in a proactive capital allocation plan focused on achieving the regular return of and on stockholder capital within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management; including pursuing selective acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures and investments. The Company is currently executing several key initiatives in connection with its capital allocation plan as further described in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis . 

Business 

The Company&#8217;s core businesses include wholesale conventional generation and B2B solutions (included in the NRG Business segment), retail electricity including personal power solutions (included in the NRG Home Retail segment), contracted generation owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the NRG Yield segment) and all other renewable utility scale and distributed generation that is not otherwise owned by NRG Yield, Inc. (included in the NRG Renew segment). In addition, the Company specifically identifies Home Solar as a separate business (included in the NRG Home Solar segment). 

Wholesale Generation 

The Company&#8217;s wholesale power generation business includes the Company's wholesale operations including plant operations, commercial operations, EPC, energy services and other critical related functions. In addition to the traditional functions, the wholesale power generation business also includes NRG&#8217;s B2B solutions, which include demand response, commodity sales, energy efficiency and energy management services, and NRG&#8217;s conventional distributed generation business, consisting of reliability, combined heat and power, thermal and district heating and cooling and large-scale distributed generation. 

The wholesale generation business is capital-intensive and commodity-driven with numerous industry participants that compete on the basis of the location of their plants, fuel mix, plant efficiency and the reliability of the services offered. The Company has one of the largest and most diversified power generation portfolios in the U.S., with approximately 44,642 MW of fossil fuel and nuclear generation capacity at 90 plants as of December 31, 2015. The Company's power generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. NRG's U.S. baseload and intermediate facilities provide the Company with a significant source of cash flow, while its peaking facilities provide NRG with opportunities to capture significant upside potential that can arise during periods of high demand, which typically drive higher energy prices. 

&#160; 

Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is currently highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the companies the Company competes with depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives and other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions. Many of the Company's generation assets, however, are located within densely populated areas that tend to have more robust wholesale pricing as a result of relatively favorable local supply-demand balance. The Company has generation assets located in or near Houston, New York City, Chicago, Washington D.C., New Jersey, southwestern Connecticut, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and the Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco metropolitan areas. These facilities, some of which are aging, are often ideally situated for repowering or the addition of new capacity because their location and existing infrastructure give them significant advantages over undeveloped sites. The Company believes that its extensive generation portfolio provides many asset optimization opportunities. To that end, the Company currently has approximately 3,397 MW targeted for Repowering and conversion initiatives, all of which is under development or construction. 

In addition, the Company continuously evaluates opportunities for development of new generation, on both a merchant and contracted basis. As such, the majority of the Company's current developments are in response to RFPs for new generation and/or generating capacity backed by contracts with credit-worthy counterparties. Many RFPs are issued by regulated utilities or electric system operators in response to reliability or renewable power mandates. The Company competes against other power plant developers when responding to these RFPs. The number and type of competitors vary based on the location, generation type, project size and counterparty specified in the RFP. Bids are awarded based on many factors including price, location of existing generation, prior experience developing generation resources similar to that specified in the RFP, and creditworthiness. 

The Company's B2B solutions focus on providing distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power or other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid. These solutions include system power, distributed generation, solar and wind products, carbon management and specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response and energy efficiency and electric vehicle charging stations. In providing on-site energy solutions, the Company often benefits from its ability to supply energy products from its wholesale generation portfolio to commercial and industrial retail customers. 

The Company also provides energy services including operations, maintenance, technical, development and asset management services to its own facilities and to external customers. 

Home Retail 

The Company's retail business provides home energy and related services as well as personal power to consumers through various brands and channels across the U.S. In 2015, the retail business delivered approximately 43 TWhs and had approximately 2.77 million Recurring customers, plus approximately 624,000 Discrete customers of products and services. The results of the Company's retail business make it the largest competitive retail energy provider in the U.S. and Texas, and one of the top six competitive retail energy providers in the East. The majority of the Company's retail business sales come in the competitive retail energy markets of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas, as well as the District of Columbia. 

Retail customers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, customer service, brand, product choices, bundles or value-added features. Customers purchase products through a variety of sales channels including direct sales, call centers, websites, brokers and brick-and-mortar stores. Through its broad range of service offerings and value propositions, NRG's retail business is able to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. NRG's retailers are recognized for exemplary customer service, innovative smart energy and technology product offerings and environmentally friendly solutions. 

Renewables 

The Company&#8217;s renewables business consists primarily of the Company&#8217;s wind and solar generation facilities that are not owned by NRG Yield, Inc. as well as the Company&#8217;s business-to-business distributed solar business. A substantial portion of the wind and solar generation facilities contained within the Company&#8217;s renewables business are subject to the ROFO Agreement between the Company and NRG Yield, Inc. In addition, the asset management and operation and maintenance groups within the renewables business manage a portfolio of wind and solar assets across 27 states, and provide a full range of solar energy solutions for utilities, schools, municipalities and businesses. 

&#160; 

The business-to-business distributed solar business targets strategic partnerships with local, regional, national and multi-national companies and institutions to provide on-site and off-site renewable generation. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 1,884 MW of utility, C&#38;I, and community renewable projects were in operation inclusive of those held both solely by the Company and in partnership with NRG Yield, Inc. In addition, the distributed solar business&#8217; backlog of contracted and awarded projects in the C&#38;I market spans 16 discrete customer programs across 12 states, and includes clients such as Kaiser Permanente, Unilever, and Cisco. In addition to assets in operation, at year end the Company held a pipeline of in-construction and development-stage projects exceeding 850 MW across the C&#38;I, community, and utility renewables markets. 

Similar to the wholesale business, the renewables business also competes for new generation opportunities through RFPs. The number and type of competitors vary based on location, generation type, project size and counterparty. The renewables business competes with traditional utilities as well as companies that provide products and services in the downstream solar and wind energy value chains. 

NRG Yield 

NRG Yield, Inc. is a publicly traded dividend growth-oriented company formed to serve as the primary vehicle through which NRG, supported by NRG Renew and NRG Business, owns, operates and acquires diversified contracted renewable and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. As of December 31, 2015, NRG owns a 55.1% voting interest in the outstanding common stock of NRG Yield, Inc. NRG Yield, Inc.&#8217;s contracted generation portfolio collectively represents 4,438 MW as of December 31, 2015. Each of the assets sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term, fixed price offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. NRG Yield, Inc. also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,315 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 124 MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot water and/or chilled water, and in some instances electricity, to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions. 

NRG Yield, Inc. provides the Company with a more competitive cost of capital consistent with the lower risk profile of long-term contracted or regulated assets. As such, NRG believes that it directly benefits from NRG Yield, Inc.&#8217;s growth through its controlling interest in NRG Yield, Inc. and by providing NRG Yield, Inc. a platform of growth through the completion of future sales of assets pursuant to the ROFO Agreement. The proceeds of such sales are expected to provide the Company with a portion of the capital utilized under its Capital Allocation Program. 

Home Solar 

The Company&#8217;s Home Solar business provides installation and contract management services for residential solar customers, allowing customers to switch to solar energy in a simple and cost-efficient manner. The Home Solar business competes against traditional power generation and retail services as well as other solar installation businesses that may offer competitive pricing. 

&#160; 

NRG Operations 

The NRG businesses described above are all supported through the NRG operational infrastructure, which begins with the Company&#8217;s asset fleet and the associated commercial and retail operations. The images below illustrate NRG's U.S. power generation and net capacity capabilities as of December 31, 2015, as well as customer, load and regional information surrounding the operation of NRG&#8217;s retail businesses:

NRG's portfolio diversification and commercial operations hedging strategy provides the Company with reliable future cash flows. &#32; NRG has hedged a portion of its coal and nuclear capacity with decreasing hedge levels through 2020. The majority of the Company's generation is in markets with forward capacity markets that extend three years into the future. These capacity revenues not only enhance the reliability of future cash flows but are not correlated to natural gas prices. NRG also has cooperative load contract obligations in the Gulf Coast region expiring at various dates through 2025, which largely hedges a portion of the Company's generation in this region. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , the Company had purchased fuel forward under fixed price contracts, with contractually-specified price escalators, for approximately 38% of its expected coal requirement from 2016 &#32;to 2020, excluding inventory. The Company enters into additional hedges when it deems market conditions to be favorable. 

The Company also has the advantage of being able to supply its retail businesses with its own generation, which can reduce the need to sell and buy power from other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in lower transaction costs and credit exposures. This combination of generation and retail allows for a reduction in actual and contingent collateral, through offsetting transactions and by reducing the need to hedge the retail power supply through third parties. 

The generation and retail combination also provides stability in cash flows, as changes in commodity prices generally have offsetting impacts between the two businesses. The offsetting nature of generation and retail, in relation to changes in market prices, is an integral part of NRG's goal of providing a reliable source of future cash flow for the Company. 

When developing new renewable and conventional power generation facilities, NRG typically secures long-term PPAs, which insulate the Company from commodity market volatility and provide future cash flow stability. These PPAs are typically contracted with high credit quality local utilities and have durations from 10 years to as much as 25 years. 

&#160; 

Commercial Operations Overview 

NRG seeks to maximize profitability and manage cash flow volatility through the marketing, trading and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services into spot, intermediate and long-term markets and through the active management and trading of emissions allowances, fuel supplies and transportation-related services. The Company's principal objectives are the realization of the full market value of its asset base, including the capture of its extrinsic value, the management and mitigation of commodity market risk and the reduction of cash flow volatility over time. 

NRG enters into power sales and hedging arrangements via a wide range of products and contracts, including PPAs, fuel supply contracts, capacity auctions, natural gas derivative instruments and other financial instruments. In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward sales contracts to manage the commodity price risk primarily associated with the Company's coal and nuclear generation assets. The objective of these hedging strategies is to stabilize the cash flow generated by NRG's portfolio of assets. 

NRG also trades electric power, natural gas and related commodity and financial products, including forwards, futures, options and swaps, through its ownership of BETM, which is also an energy management service provider for primarily third-party generating assets. Certain other NRG entities trade to a lesser extent, utilizing similar products as well as oil and weather products. The Company seeks to generate profits from volatility in the price of electricity, capacity, fuels and transmission congestion by buying and selling contracts in wholesale markets under guidelines approved by the Company's risk management committee. 

Coal and Nuclear Operations 

The following table summarizes NRG's U.S. coal and nuclear capacity and the corresponding revenues and average natural gas prices and positions resulting from coal and nuclear hedge agreements extending beyond December 31, 2015 , and through 2019 for the Company's Gulf Coast region:

(a) 

Net coal capacity represents nominal summer net MW capacity of power generated as adjusted for the Company's ownership position excluding capacity from inactive/mothballed units, see Item 2 - Properties for units scheduled to be deactivated. 

(b) 

Forecasted generation dispatch output (MWh) based on forward price curves as of December 31, 2015 , which is then divided by number of hours in a given year to arrive at MW capacity. The dispatch takes into account planned and unplanned outage assumptions. 

(c) 

Includes amounts under power sales contracts and natural gas hedges. The forward natural gas quantities are reflected in equivalent MWh based on forward market implied heat rate as of December 31, 2015 , and then combined with power sales to arrive at equivalent MWh hedged which is then divided by number of hours in a given year to arrive at MW hedged. The coal sales include swaps and delta of options sold which is subject to change. For detailed information on the Company's hedging methodology through use of derivative instruments, see discussion in Item 15 - Note 5 , Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Includes inter-segment sales from the Company's wholesale power generation business to the retail business. 

(d) 

Percentage hedged is based on total coal sales as described in (c) above divided by the forecasted coal capacity. 

(e) 

Represents U.S. coal sales, including energy revenue and demand charges, excluding revenues derived from capacity auctions. 

Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue Sources 

NRG's revenues and cash flows benefit from capacity/demand payments and other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, Resource Adequacy contracts, tolling arrangements, PPAs and other long-term contractual arrangements: 

&#8226; 

Capacity auctions &#8212; The Company's largest sources of capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM, ISO-NE, and NYISO. Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time performance, where NRG's actual revenues will be the combination of revenues based on the cleared auction MWs plus the net of any over- and under-performance of NRG's fleet. PJM integrated a new Capacity Performance product into the market in 2015, as further described in Regulatory Matters . In addition, MISO has an annual auction, known as the Planning Resource Auction, or PRA. The Gulf Coast assets situated in the MISO market may participate in this auction. In certain circumstances, capacity from the Gulf Coast region may be sold into the PJM market. 

&#8226; 

Resource Adequacy and bilateral contracts &#32;&#8212; In California, there is a resource adequacy requirement mandated by law that is satisfied through bilateral contracts. The Company's newer generation in California is contracted under long-term tolling agreements. Certain other sites in California have short-term tolling agreements or resource adequacy contracts. In addition, NRG earns demand payments from its long-term full-requirements load contracts with nine Louisiana distribution cooperatives, which expire in 2025. Demand payments from the current long-term contracts are tied to summer peak demand and provide a mechanism for recovering a portion of the costs associated with new or changed environmental laws or regulations. In Texas, capacity and contracted revenues are through bilateral contracts with load serving entities. 

&#8226; 

Long-term PPAs &#32;&#32;&#8212; Output from the majority of renewable energy assets and certain conventional energy plants is sold through long-term PPAs and tolling agreements to a single counterparty, which is often a utility or commercial customer. 

&#160; 

Fuel Supply and Transportation 

NRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel including coal, natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel. The prices of fossil fuels are highly volatile. The Company obtains its fossil fuels from multiple suppliers and through multiple transportation sources. Although availability is generally not an issue, localized shortages, transportation availability, delays arising from extreme weather conditions and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are fairly uniform across the Company's business segments and fuel products used. 

Coal &#160;&#8212; The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements for its domestic coal consumption for 2016 . NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site. As of December 31, 2015 , NRG had purchased forward contracts to provide fuel for approximately 34% of the Company's expected requirements from 2016 &#32;through 2020 , excluding inventory. NRG purchased approximately 43 million tons of coal in 2015 , of which 80% was Powder River Basin coal and lignite, and 20% was waste and Appalachian coal. For fuel transport, NRG has entered into various rail, barge, truck transportation and rail car lease agreements with varying tenures that provide for substantially all of the Company's transportation requirement of Powder River Basin coal for the next two years and for most of the Company's transportation requirements of Appalachian coal for the next year. 

The following table shows the percentage of the Company's coal requirements from 2016 &#32;through 2020 &#32;that have been purchased forward as of December 31, 2015 :

The hedge percentages reflect the current plan for the Jewett mine, which supplies lignite for NRG's Limestone facility. NRG has the contractual ability to change volumes and may do so in the future. 

(b) 

Includes expected coal inventory draw down. 

Natural Gas &#160;&#8212; NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants across all its U.S. wholesale regions. Fuel needs are managed on a spot basis, especially for peaking assets, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for units, the dispatch of which is highly unpredictable. The Company contracts for natural gas storage services as well as natural gas transportation services to deliver natural gas when needed. 

Nuclear Fuel &#160;&#8212; STP's owners satisfy their fuel supply requirements by: (i) acquiring uranium concentrates and contracting for conversion of the uranium concentrates into uranium hexafluoride; (ii) contracting for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. Through its proportionate participation in STPNOC, which is the NRC-licensed operator of STP and responsible for all aspects of fuel procurement, NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts with many of the world's largest suppliers covering STP's requirements for uranium concentrates with only approximately 25% of STP's requirements outstanding for the duration of the operating license. Similarly, NRG is party to long-term contracts to procure STP's requirements for conversion and enrichment services and fuel fabrication for the life of the operating license. 

Retail Operations 

In 2015 , NRG's retail businesses sold electricity to residential, commercial and industrial consumers at either fixed, indexed or variable prices. Residential and smaller commercial consumers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to two years while industrial contracts are often between one year and five years in length. In 2015 , NRG's retail businesses sold approximately 62 TWhs of electricity. In any given year, the quantity of TWh sold can be affected by weather, economic conditions and competition. The wholesale supply is typically purchased as the load is contracted from a combination of NRG's wholesale portfolio and other third parties. The ability to choose supply from the market or the Company's portfolio allows for an optimal combination to support and stabilize retail margins. 

&#160; 

Seasonality and Price Volatility 

Annual and quarterly operating results of the Company's wholesale power generation segments can be significantly affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility. Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the Company's wholesale generation business segments. 

The sale of electric power to retail customers is also a seasonal business with the demand for power generally peaking during the summer months. As a result, net working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer months along with the higher revenues, and then decline during off-peak months. Weather may impact operating results and extreme weather conditions could materially affect results of operations. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power prices and market dynamics like the price of natural gas, transmission constraints, competitor actions, and changes in market heat rates. 

Operational Statistics 

The following are industry statistics for the Company's fossil and nuclear plants, as defined by the NERC, and are more fully described below: 

Annual Equivalent Availability Factor, or EAF &#160;&#8212; Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be provided over a defined period of time after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken into account. 

Net Heat Rate &#160;&#8212; The net heat rate represents the total amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided. 

Net Capacity Factor &#160;&#8212; The net amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used during generation. 

The tables below present these performance metrics for the Company's U.S. power generation portfolio, including leased facilities and those accounted for through equity method investments, for the years ended December 31, 2015 , and 2014 :

Segment Review 

Effective in December 2014, the Company's segment structure and its allocation of corporate expenses were updated to reflect how management makes financial decisions and allocates resources. The Company has recast data from prior periods to reflect this change in reportable segments to conform to the current year presentation. The Company's businesses are segregated as follows: NRG Business; NRG Home, which includes NRG Home Retail and NRG Home Solar; NRG Renew, which includes solar and wind assets, excluding those in NRG Yield; NRG Yield and corporate activities. The Company's corporate segment includes BETM, international business and electric vehicle services. Intersegment sales are accounted for at market. NRG Yield includes certain of the Company's contracted generation assets. NRG Yield acquired certain assets from the Company, which were accounted for as transfers of entities under common control and accordingly, all historical periods have been recast to reflect these changes: 

&#8226; 

On June 30, 2014, El Segundo Energy Center, formerly in the NRG Business segment, Kansas South and High Desert, both formerly in the NRG Renew segment. 

&#8226; 

On January 2, 2015, Walnut Creek, formerly in the NRG Business segment, the Tapestry projects (Buffalo Bear, Pinnacle, and Taloga) and Laredo Ridge, both formerly in the NRG Renew segment. 

&#8226; 

On November 3, 2015, 75% of the class B interests in NRG Wind TE Holdco, which owns a portfolio of 12 wind facilities, formerly in the NRG Renew segment. 

Revenues 

The following table contains a summary of NRG's operating revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , as discussed in Item 15 &#8212; Note 18 , Segment Reporting , &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Market Framework 

Organized Energy Markets in CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM 

The majority of NRG's fleet operates in one of the organized energy markets, known as RTOs or ISOs. Each organized market administers day-ahead and real-time centralized bid-based energy and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price, or LMP. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power. These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates. 

Other than ERCOT, each of the ISO regions also operates a capacity or resource adequacy market that provides an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets. The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations. 

Gulf Coast 

NRG's Gulf Coast wholesale power generation business is principally located in the ERCOT and MISO markets. The ERCOT market is one of the nation's largest and historically fastest growing power markets. For 2015 , hourly demand ranged from a low of approximately 24,293 MW to a high of approximately 69,877 MW on August 10, 2015, which was a new all-time peak demand record in ERCOT, surpassing the previous record of 68,305 MW, set on August 3, 2011. The ERCOT region contains installed generation capacity of approximately 90,401 MW (approximately 24,190 MW from coal, lignite and nuclear plants, 45,926 MW from gas, and 20,285 MW from wind, hydro, solar, biomass and behind-the-meter generation). The ERCOT market has limited interconnections to other markets in the U.S. In addition, NRG's retail business activities in Texas are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the PUCT and ERCOT, including the requirement for retailers to be certified by the PUCT in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity. In Texas, a majority of the load is in the ERCOT market region and is served by competitive retail suppliers, except certain areas that are served by municipal utilities and electric cooperatives that have not opted into competitive choice. 

A number of market rule changes have been implemented to provide pricing more reflective of higher energy value when operating reserves are scarce or constrained. The primary stated goal of these market rule changes is to improve scarcity price formation, forward market pricing signals and provide incentives for resource investment. Among the changes already implemented are: introduction of an operating reserve demand curve to establish scarcity prices in the real-time market when reserves are depleted, an increase to the system-wide energy and ancillary service offer caps, currently at $9,000 per MWh, an increase to the annual peaker net margin threshold to $315,000 from $175,000, an increase to the low system-wide energy offer cap to $2,000 (up from $500), higher energy pricing for ISO reliability unit commitments for capacity, and energy price adders to offset the price suppressing impacts of out-of-market commitments for reliability. 

On December 19, 2013, Entergy joined MISO and, as a result, NRG's Gulf Coast region generation assets operating in the Entergy region, are now principally located within the MISO, participating in the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, MISO employs a one-year forward resource adequacy construct, in which capacity resources can compete for fixed cost recovery in the capacity auction. NRG continues to provide full requirement services to load-serving entities, including cooperatives and municipalities in the MISO region. 

&#160; 

East 

NRG's generation and demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of the ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM. Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, each allows capacity resources to compete for fixed cost recovery in a capacity auction. 

The East region achieves a significant portion of its revenues from capacity markets in ISO-NE, NYISO and PJM. PJM and ISO-NE employ a three-year forward capacity auction construct, while NYISO employs a month-ahead capacity auction construct. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity. Both ISO-NE and PJM operate a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time generator performance. In such markets, NRG&#8217;s actual revenues will be the combination of cleared auction MWs times the quantity of MWs cleared, plus the net of any over-performance &#8220;bonus payments&#8221; and any under-performance charges. Non-performance penalties are set to increase over the next several years to over $3,000/MW-hour. In both markets, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids. 

West 

The Company operates a fleet of natural gas fired facilities located entirely within the CAISO footprint. The CAISO operates day-ahead and real-time locational markets for energy and ancillary services, while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices. The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity products at market-based rates, either within the CAISO's centralized energy and ancillary service markets or bilaterally pursuant to tolling arrangements or other capacity sale with California's LSEs. The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO. Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas. Additionally, the CAISO has independent authority to contract with needed resources under certain circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly. 

The increase in renewable resources in California is expected to drive a growing need for generation resources with increased operating flexibility, in addition to the established need for dispatchable generation within transmission-constrained areas of the transmission system, such as the San Diego, Greater San Francisco Bay Area, Big Creek/Ventura, and Los Angeles local reliability areas in which the Company currently operates natural gas-fired generation. The projected retirement of older flexible gas-fired coastal generating units that utilize once-through cooling is also a significant driver of long-term prices in California. Implementing market mechanisms to procure the needed flexibility, and allocating the costs associated with this flexibility, are key CAISO initiatives. The Company is pursuing repowering projects at several of its Southern California sites pursuant to long-term contracts. 

Renewables 

The Company operates a fleet of utility scale and distributed renewable generating assets across the U.S. Many states have implemented their own renewable portfolio standards requiring LSEs to provide a given percentage of their energy sales from renewable resources, such as 33% of generation by 2020 in California. As a result, a number of LSEs have entered into long-term PPAs with the Company's utility scale renewable generating facilities. In California and Arizona, investor-owned utilities are nearing their procurement requirement, resulting in a trend towards smaller sized utility scale projects and a shift of contracting to municipalities and other public power entities. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar ITC so that projects which begin construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC. Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22%, respectively. The same legislation also extended the 10-year wind PTC for wind projects which begin construction in years 2016 through 2019. Wind projects which begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively. 

&#160; 

Retail 

NRG's retail business sells energy and related services as well as portable power and battery solutions to customers across the country. In most of the states that have introduced retail competition, NRG's retail business competitively offers retail power, natural gas, portable power or other value-enhancing services to end-use customers. Each retail choice state establishes its own retail competition laws and regulations, and the specific operational, licensing, and compliance requirements vary on a state-by-state basis. In the East markets, incumbent utilities currently provide default service and as a result typically serve a majority of residential customers. Regulated terms and conditions of default service, as well as any movement to replace default service with competitive services, as is done in ERCOT, can affect customer participation in retail competition. The attractiveness of NRG's retail offerings in each state may be impacted by the rules, regulations, market structure and communication requirements from public utility commissions across the country. 

Home Solar 

The Home Solar business operates in a number of states where solar solutions are attractive and price competitive to consumers. Many state public service commissions are evaluating changes to their retail rules, including net metering rules, imposition of minimum bills or an increased fixed component to bills, among other potential changes. In December 2015, the U.S. Congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar ITC so that projects which begin construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC. Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at rates of 26% and 22%, respectively. The ITC reverts to a permanent 10% thereafter. 

Regulatory Matters 

As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and retail energy markets, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generating, thermal, or distributed generation assets are located. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the states in which NRG entities are licensed to sell at retail. NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and the regional reliability entities in the regions where the Company operates. &#32;&#32; 

NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to the Company's ownership interest in STP. 

Federal Regulation 

CFTC 

The CFTC, among other things, has regulatory oversight authority over the trading of swaps, futures and many commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. Since 2010, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the U.S. and internationally. These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions. 

FERC 

FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale by public utilities of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA. Under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a QF under PURPA. The transmission of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC's rate jurisdiction under Sections 203 or 205 of the FPA. Each of NRG's non-ERCOT U.S. generating facilities either qualifies as a QF, or the subsidiary owning the facility qualifies as an EWG. 

Public utilities are required to obtain FERC's acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. Generally all of NRG's non-QF generating and power marketing entities located outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates. 

&#160; 

U.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Consider the Constitutionality of Maryland's Generator Contracting Programs &#32;&#8212; On October 19, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of certain state-directed procurements of new electric generating facilities. The case involves the authority of the Maryland Public Service Commission to direct load-serving utilities in the state to enter into long-term power purchase contracts with a generation developer to encourage the construction of new generation capacity in Maryland. The constitutionality of the long-term contracts was challenged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, which, in an October 24, 2013, decision, found that the contracts violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution because they were both conflict preempted and field preempted by the FPA and the authority that the FPA granted to FERC. On June 30, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. A case arising out of New Jersey and raising similar issues was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which also determined that the state-mandated contracts were preempted. After the Supreme Court granted certiorari in the Maryland case, the Company filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Court to uphold the right of states to incentivize new generation by directing utilities in the state to enter into long-term contracts &#8212; but noted that FERC has both the authority and the statutory obligation to protect wholesale markets by requiring that bids in the wholesale markets reflect costs and by ensuring that uneconomic entry does not distort auction outcomes. The Supreme Court heard oral argument on February 24, 2016. The outcome of this litigation could have broad impacts on whether and how states require utilities to contract with new generation resources, as well as how such contracted resources interact with the FERC-jurisdictional wholesale markets. 

U.S. Supreme Court Allows FERC to Retain Jurisdiction Over Demand Response &#8212; On January 25, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 6-2 decision affirming FERC&#8217;s ability to exercise jurisdiction over demand response resources seeking to voluntarily participate in the wholesale markets. Additionally, the Supreme Court upheld FERC&#8217;s preferred scheme for pricing demand response in the energy market. This case arose out of a May 23, 2014, decision by the D.C. Circuit which vacated FERC&#8217;s rules (known as Order No. 745) that set the compensation level for demand response resources participating in the FERC-jurisdictional energy markets. The Court of Appeals had held that the FPA does not authorize FERC to exercise jurisdiction over demand response and that instead demand response is part of the retail market over which the states have jurisdiction. With the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision, FERC will resume exercising jurisdiction over demand response, which the Company views as a positive for both its wholesale and distributed businesses. 

State Regulation 

In Texas, NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to the Company's ownership interest in STP. 

In New York, the Company's generation subsidiaries are electric corporations subject to "lightened" regulation by the NYSPSC. As such, the NYSPSC exercises its jurisdictional authority over certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including safety, retirements, and the issuance of debt secured by recourse to the Company's generation assets located in New York. The Company currently has blanket authorization from the NYSPSC for the issuance of $15 billion of debt. Additionally, the NYSPSC has provided GenOn Bowline with a separate debt authorization of $1.488 billion. 

In California, the Company's generation subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the CPUC with regard to certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including health and safety, outage reporting and other aspects of the facilities' operations. Additionally, the competitiveness of many of NRG's new businesses is dependent on state competition and other policies. 

Nuclear Operations 

NRG South Texas LP is a 44% owner of a joint undivided interest in STP, the other owners of STP being the City of Austin, Texas (16%) and the City Public Service Board of San Antonio (40%). STP Nuclear Operating Company, or STPNOC, was founded by the then-owners in 1997 to operate the plant and it is the operator licensee and holder of the Facility Operating Licenses NPF-76 and NPF-80. STPNOC is a nonstock, nonprofit, nonmember corporation. Each owner of STP appoints a board member (and the three directors then choose a fourth director who also serves as the chief executive officer of STPNOC). A participation agreement establishes an owners' committee with voting interests consistent with ownership interests. 

As a holder of an ownership interest in STP, NRG South Texas LP is an NRC licensee and is subject to NRC regulation. The NRC license gives the Company the right only to possess an interest in STP but not to operate it. As a possession-only licensee, i.e., non-operating co-owner, the NRC's regulation of NRG South Texas LP is primarily focused on the Company's ability to meet its financial and decommissioning funding assurance obligations. In connection with the NRC license, the Company and its subsidiaries have a support agreement to provide up to $120 million to support operations at STP. 

&#160; 

&#32; Decommissioning Trusts &#160;&#8212; Upon expiration of the operating licenses for the two generating units at STP, currently scheduled for 2027 and 2028, the co-owners of STP are required under federal law to decontaminate and decommission the STP facility. Under NRC regulations, a power reactor licensee generally must pre-fund the full amount of its estimated NRC decommissioning obligations unless it is a rate-regulated utility, or a state or municipal entity that sets its own rates, or has the benefit of a state-mandated non-bypassable charge available to periodically fund the decommissioning trust such that the trust, plus allowable earnings, will equal the estimated decommissioning obligations by the time the decommissioning is expected to begin. 

&#32;NRG South Texas LP, through its 44% ownership interest, is the beneficiary of decommissioning trusts that have been established to provide funding for decontamination and decommissioning of STP. CenterPoint and AEP collect, through rates or other authorized charges to their electric utility customers, amounts designated for funding NRG South Texas LP's portion of the decommissioning of the facility. NRG South Texas LP filed a decommissioning cost rate case with the PUCT in 2013 based upon a third party cost study and assuming a twenty year license extension, which resulted in a decrease in the rate of collections. The PUCT approved the rate changes. See also Item 15 &#8212; Note 6 , Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund , &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. 

In the event that the funds from the trusts are ultimately determined to be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the original owners of the Company's STP interests, CenterPoint and AEP, each will be required to collect, through their PUCT-authorized non-bypassable rates or other charges to customers, additional amounts required to fund NRG South Texas LP's obligations relating to the decommissioning of the facility. Following the completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, those excesses will be refunded to the respective rate payers of CenterPoint or AEP, or their successors. 

STP License Amendment &#8212; On November 18, 2015, STP Unit 1 Shutdown Bank Control Rod D6 was determined to be inoperable following a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage. Following extensive analyses, on December 3, 2015, STPNOC submitted an Emergency License Amendment Request to the NRC seeking authorization to operate Unit 1 during the next 18-month operating cycle with 56 full-length control rods instead of 57. The NRC approved the license amendment on December 11, 2015. The approved license amendment supports STP Unit 1 operation with Control Rod D6 and the associated control rod drive shaft removed. STPNOC anticipates seeking a license amendment to allow for the continued operation of Unit 1 in this configuration in the first quarter of 2016. 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission Near-Term Task Force Report &#8212; On July 12, 2011, the NRC Near-Term Task Force, or the Task Force, issued its report, which reviewed nuclear processes and regulations in light of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan. The Task Force concluded that U.S. nuclear plants are operating safely and did not identify changes to the existing nuclear licensing process nor recommend fundamental changes to spent nuclear fuel storage. The Task Force report made recommendations in three key areas: the NRC's regulatory framework, specific plant design requirements, and emergency preparedness and actions. Among other things, the Task Force required each operator to conduct a review of seismic and flooding risks (beyond the design license basis). STPNOC&#8217;s analysis confirmed the design adequacy and determined that no other actions are needed with respect to these risks. In conducting its review, STPNOC followed the guidance in the &#8220; Seismic Evaluation Guidance: Screening, Prioritization, and Implementation Details (SPID) for the Resolution of Fukushima Near-Term Task Force Recommendation 2.1: Seismic &#8221; report published by the Electric Power Research Institute. 

Other responsive actions include installation of additional safety-related, redundant cooling systems, hardening of spent fuel pool instrumentation, improved emergency communications and increased responsive staffing, and the establishment of two FLEX (Flexible Emergency Response Equipment) sites serving the entire industry. With respect to STP, all currently identified tasks were completed with the conclusion of the refueling outage in December 2015. Until further action is taken by the NRC (including issuance of actions required in response to Tier 2 and 3 recommendations), the Company cannot definitively predict the impact of any additional recommendations by the Task Force and could be required to make additional investments at STP Units 1 and 2. 

&#160; 

&#32; Regional Regulatory Developments 

NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 &#8212; Note 23 , Regulatory Matters , &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

East Region 

PJM 

PJM Auction Results &#8212; On August 21, 2015, PJM announced the results of its 2018/2019 Base Residual Auction, officially integrating the new Capacity Performance product into the market. NRG cleared approximately 13,388 MW of Capacity Performance product and 784 MW of Base Capacity product in the 2018/2019 Base Residual Auction. NRG&#8217;s expected capacity revenues from the 2018/2019 Base Residual Auction are approximately $900 million. PJM announced the results of its Transitional Capacity Auctions for the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 delivery years, respectively, on August 31, 2015, and September 9, 2015. NRG cleared approximately 3,900 MW of Capacity Performance product in the 2016/2017 Transactional Capacity Auction, and 9,700 MW of Capacity Performance product in the 2017/2018 Transitional Capacity Auction. NRG expects an approximately $425 million increase in PJM capacity revenue from 2016/2017 to 2018/2019 due to the Capacity Performance product.

Capacity Performance Rehearings &#32;&#8212; On June 9, 2015, FERC approved changes to PJM&#8217;s capacity market. Major elements of the approved changes to the Capacity Performance framework include the calculation of the bid cap, elimination of the 2.5% holdback for short lead-time resources, and substantial performance penalties on Capacity Performance resources that do not perform in real time during specific periods of high demand. The rules mandate that underperformance penalties be paid to units that over perform during those periods of high demand. NRG&#8217;s actual revenues will be the combination of the revenues based on the cleared auction MW plus the net of any over and under performance of NRG's fleet. On July 9, 2015, multiple parties, including NRG, filed requests for rehearings at FERC regarding the framework of the new annual capacity auctions. Rehearing is pending. 

In addition, multiple parties sought clarification on whether demand resources could participate in the Capacity Performance Transition Auctions. On July 22, 2015, FERC issued an order allowing demand response and energy efficiency resources to participate in the Capacity Performance Transition Auctions. Rehearing is pending. 

Capacity Replacement &#32;&#8212; On March 10, 2014, PJM filed at FERC to limit speculation in the forward capacity auction. Specifically, PJM proposed tariff changes that are designed to ensure that only capacity resources that are reasonably expected to be provided as a physical resource by the start of the delivery year can participate in the Base Residual Auction. These changes include the addition of a replacement capacity adjustment charge that is intended to remove the incentive to profit from replacing capacity commitments, an increase in deficiency penalties for non-performance, and a reduction in the number of incremental auctions from three to one. On May 9, 2014, FERC rejected PJM&#8217;s proposed changes to address replacement capacity and incremental auction design, but established a Section 206 proceeding and technical conference to find a just-and-reasonable outcome. On August 18, 2014, PJM requested that FERC defer further action in the proceeding. Since the request, FERC has taken no action. The Section 206 proceeding and technical conference could have a material impact on future PJM capacity prices. 

&#160; 

Reactive Power &#8212; On November 20, 2014, FERC issued an Order to Show Cause under FPA Section 206 directing PJM to either revise its tariff to provide that a generation or non-generation resource owner will no longer receive reactive power capability payments after it has deactivated its unit and to clarify the treatment of reactive power capability payments for units transferred out of a fleet or show cause why it should not be required to do so. On December 22, 2014, PJM filed proposed tariff changes, and the matter remains pending at FERC. NRG's reactive power revenues may change as a result of this proceeding. 

Demand Response Operability &#8212; &#32; On May 9, 2014, FERC largely accepted PJM&#8217;s proposed changes on demand response operability in an attempt to enhance the operational flexibility of demand response resources during the operating day. The approval of these changes will likely limit the amount of demand response resources eligible to participate in PJM. The matter is pending rehearing at FERC. 

MOPR Revisions &#32;&#8212; On May 2, 2013, FERC accepted PJM's proposal to substantially revise its Minimum Offer Price Rule. Among other things, FERC approved the portions of the PJM proposal that exempt many new entrants from demonstrating that their proposed projects are economic, as well as providing a similar exemption from public power entities and certain self-supply entities. This exemption is subject to certain conditions designed to limit the financial incentive of such entities to suppress market prices. On June 3, 2013, the Company filed a request for rehearing of the FERC order and subsequently protested the manner in which PJM proposed to implement the FERC order. On October 15, 2015, FERC denied the requests for rehearing and accepted PJM&#8217;s compliance filing. The Company, along with other parties, filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit. 

AEP and FirstEnergy Ohio Contracts &#32;&#8212; FirstEnergy and AEP, through their regulated Ohio utilities, have sought approval at the Public Utility Commission of Ohio of a capacity market &#8220;swap&#8221; where FirstEnergy&#8217;s and AEP&#8217;s &#8220;merchant&#8221; resources would recover the full costs of their generation facilities through a non-bypassable surcharge applicable to all Ohio retail customers. Evidence introduced in the Ohio proceeding suggests that these contracts could impose more than $1,000 per Ohio retail customer in excess costs over the next eight years. A coalition of consumer and supply groups are opposing the proposed contracts before the Public Utility Commission of Ohio. Additionally, NRG and numerous other coalition members have filed a complaint at FERC questioning whether FirstEnergy and AEP have the regulatory approvals necessary to enter into above-market contracts with their generation affiliates without further FERC review. That complaint is pending at FERC. 

New England 

Performance Incentive Proposal &#8212; On January 17, 2014, ISO-NE filed at FERC to revise its forward capacity market, or FCM, by making a resource&#8217;s forward capacity market compensation dependent on resource output during short intervals of operating reserve scarcity. The ISO-NE proposal would replace the existing shortage event penalty structure with a new performance incentive, or PI, mechanism, resulting in capacity payments to resources that would be the combination of two components: (1) a base capacity payment and (2) a performance payment or charge. The performance payment or charge would be entirely dependent upon the resource&#8217;s delivery of energy or operating reserves during scarcity conditions, and could be larger than the base payment. 

On May 30, 2014, FERC found that most of the provisions in the ISO-NE proposal, with modifications, together with an increase to the reserve constraint penalty factors, provided a just and reasonable structure. FERC instituted a proceeding for further hearings and required ISO-NE to make a compliance filing to modify its proposal and adopt the increases to the reserve constraint penalty factors. FERC denied rehearing. The New England Power Generators Association filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit. 

FCM Rules for 2014 Forward Capacity Auction &#8212; On February 28, 2014, ISO-NE filed with FERC the results of Forward Capacity Auction 8. On September 16, 2014, FERC issued a notice stating that the Forward Capacity Auction 8 results would go into effect by operation of law. Several parties requested rehearing of FERC&#8217;s notice. FERC rejected those requests on legal and procedural grounds. A petition for review of FERC's decision was filed with the D.C. Circuit. The Company, along with other parties, filed a brief in support of FERC. An adverse decision could call into question the capacity revenues associated with the 2017/2018 delivery year. 

Sloped Demand Curve Filing &#8212; On May 30, 2014, FERC accepted the proposed tariff revisions discussed in the April 1, 2014 ISO-NE filing at FERC regarding the establishment of a sloped demand curve for use in the ISO-NE Forward Capacity Market. The accepted tariff changes include extending the period during which a market participant can lock-in the capacity price for a new resource from five to seven years, establishing a limited exemption for the buyer-side market mitigation rules for a set amount of renewable resources, and eliminating the administrative pricing rules. The shift away from the current vertical demand curve and accompanying proposed changes could have a material impact on the capacity prices in future auctions as well as an impact on resources that have a price lock-in. FERC denied rehearing . The Company, along with other generators, filed a petition for review of FERC's decision with the D.C. Circuit. &#32; 

&#160; 

In December 2015, FERC voluntarily requested a remand from the D.C. Circuit. FERC also instituted a FPA Section 206 proceeding, directing ISO-NE to submit tariff revisions by March 31, 2016, providing for zonal sloped demand curves to be implemented beginning in Forward Capacity Auction 11. The ultimate outcome of this proceeding will affect the market design governing future capacity auctions in New England. 

Challenge to ISO-NE&#8217;s Seven-Year Lock-In for New Resources &#8212; On February 8, 2016, parties filed a petition in the D.C. Circuit requesting that the Court invalidate FERC&#8217;s approval of a &#8220;price lock&#8221; mechanism for new resources in New England. The price lock mechanism permits qualified new resources that clear the auction to receive their first-year clearing price for seven years. Any change to the price lock mechanism could affect future capacity prices in New England, as well as affect the price that already-cleared resources that elected the price lock could receive from the capacity market in future years. 

New York 

Dunkirk Power Reliability Service and Natural Gas Addition &#8212; &#32; Dunkirk Power LLC has been operating one unit (Unit 2) under a reliability services agreement with National Grid, or RSSA, through May 31, 2015. On May 18, 2015, the NYSPSC approved National Grid's request for a seven-month extension of the RSSA with Dunkirk to December 31, 2015. Subsequently, National Grid confirmed that Dunkirk would not be needed for reliability past December 31, 2015, and the facility ceased operations at the end of 2015. 

In addition, on February 13, 2014, Dunkirk Power LLC and National Grid agreed to a term sheet for a 10-year agreement to govern the addition of natural gas-burning capabilities to the Dunkirk facility. This term sheet, known as the DNG Agreement Term Sheet, was approved by the NYSPSC on June 13, 2014. On February 27, 2015, Entergy filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York alleging that the NYSPSC&#8217;s approval of the DNG Agreement Term Sheet represents an impermissible interference with FERC&#8217;s exclusive jurisdiction over the wholesale markets. The U.S. District Court has stayed further discovery until the case goes through summary judgment procedures. In connection with the mothball of the facility, the pending litigation and the latest reliability assessment completed by NYISO, the Company evaluated the related assets for impairment and recorded an impairment loss, as further described in Item 15 - Note 10, Asset Impairments , &#32; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Request for Investigation of NRG&#8217;s Activities Regarding NRG&#8217;s Dunkirk Facility &#8212; On February 9, 2016, the governor of New York sent a letter to the NYSPSC requesting that it investigate whether NRG acted properly in connection with the reliability services provided by the Dunkirk facility between 2012 and 2015, as well as with respect to NRG&#8217;s repowering of the Dunkirk facility, both as approved by the NYPSC. The Company believes that the allegations in the letter have no merit and intends to vigorously dispute these allegations. 

&#32; Huntley Power Reliability Service &#32;&#8212; On August 25, 2015, Huntley Power filed a notice with the NYSPSC of its intent to retire Huntley's operating units on March 1, 2016. Huntley Power filed a cost-of-service filing but subsequently withdrew the filing after NYISO confirmed that Huntley would not be needed for bulk system reliability. 

FERC Investigation of NYISO RMR Practices &#8212; On February 19, 2015, pursuant to Section 206 of the FPA, FERC found NYISO&#8217;s tariff to be unjust and unreasonable because it did not contain provisions governing the retention of and compensation to generating units for reliability. FERC ordered NYISO to adopt tariff provisions containing a proposed RMR rate schedule and pro forma RMR agreement within 120 days of the date of FERC&#8217;s order. On October 19, 2015, NYISO filed its tariff revisions at FERC. NRG protested the filing. The matter is pending before FERC. 

Competitive Entry Exemption to Buyer-Side Mitigation Rules &#8212; On December 4, 2014, pursuant to Section 206 of the FPA, a group of New York transmission owners filed a complaint seeking a competitive entry exemption to the current NYISO buyer-side mitigation rules. On December 16, 2014, TDI USA Holdings Corporation filed a complaint under Section 206 of the FPA against the NYISO claiming that the NYISO&#8217;s application of the Mitigation Exemption Test under the buyer-side mitigation rules to TDI&#8217;s Champlain Hudson 1,000 MW transmission line project is unjust and unreasonable and seeks an exemption from the Mitigation Exemption Test. On February 26, 2015, FERC granted the complaint filed by the New York transmission owners and directed the NYISO to adopt a competitive entry exemption into its tariff within 30 days. In a companion order issued on the same day, FERC rejected the TDI complaint on the grounds that TDI&#8217;s concerns were adequately addressed by FERC&#8217;s first order. On March 30, 2015, NRG filed a request for rehearing. On August 4, 2015, FERC granted in part and denied in part the rehearing requests and conditionally accepted NYISO's compliance filing subject to revisions clarifying that the competitive entry exemption is not available for generator or unforced capacity deliverability rights projects that are members of the completed class years. 

&#160; 

Revisions to the Buyer-Side Mitigation Rules &#8212; On May 8, 2015, several New York entities, including the NYSPSC, filed a complaint against the NYISO under Section 206 of the FPA seeking revisions to the buyer-side market power mitigation measures of the NYISO tariff. The parties requested FERC to find that the current buyer-side mitigation rules are unjust and unreasonable because they prevent the ICAP market from functioning properly and that the rules should apply only to a limited subset of generation facilities. NRG protested the complaint. On October 9, 2015, FERC held that certain renewables and self-supply resources should be exempt from buyer-side mitigation rules and ordered the NYISO to submit a compliance filing. On February 5, 2016, FERC denied rehearing. The NYISO has yet to issue its compliance filing addressing FERC's order to develop exemptions for certain renewables and self-supply resources. The eventual disposition of this case could impact the ability of uneconomic resources to enter the New York market. 

Independent Power Producers of New York (IPPNY) Complaint &#32;&#8212; On May 10, 2013, as amended on March 25, 2014, a generator trade association in New York filed a complaint at FERC against the NYISO. The generators asked FERC to direct the NYISO to require that capacity from existing generation resources that would have exited the market but for out-of-market payments under RMR-type agreements be excluded from the capacity market altogether or be offered at levels no lower than the resources' going-forward costs. The complaints point to the recent reliability services agreements entered into between the NYSPSC and generators, including Dunkirk Power, as evidence that capacity market prices are being influenced by non-market considerations. 

On March 19, 2015, FERC denied IPPNY&#8217;s complaint and directed NYISO to establish a stakeholder process to consider whether there are circumstances that warrant the adoption of buyer-side mitigation rules in the rest-of-state, and whether mitigation measures would need to be in place to address any price suppressing effects of repowering agreements. On June 17, 2015, NYISO filed its compliance report describing the outcome of the stakeholder process on concluding that buyer-side mitigation measures in the rest-of-state are not warranted. On November 16, 2015, FERC directed the NYISO to provide additional information. On December 16, 2015, NYISO filed responses to FERC's request. Rehearing is pending. Failure to implement buyer-side mitigation measures could result in uneconomic entry, which artificially decreases capacity prices below competitive market levels. 

Gulf Coast Region 

ERCOT 

Houston Import Project &#32;&#8212; At its April 8, 2014, meeting, the ERCOT Board endorsed a new 345 kV transmission line project designed to address purported reliability challenges related to congestion between north Texas and the Houston region. On November 14, 2014, the PUCT denied a challenge by the Company and Calpine Corp. regarding ERCOT's endorsement of the project. Following a contested hearing, in January 2016, the PUCT approved certificates of convenience and necessity authorizing the transmission utilities to proceed with the project which is projected to be operational by the summer of 2018. The project could reduce congestion-related energy prices in the Houston region, where the Company owns several generating stations. 

MISO &#32; 

Complaints regarding the 2015/2016 Planning Resource Auction &#8212; In May 2015, the Illinois Attorney General, Public Citizen, Inc., and Southwestern Electric Cooperative, Inc. filed complaints against MISO on the grounds that the results of the MISO 2015/2016 Planning Resource Auction resulted in unjust and unreasonable prices, specifically the auction clearing price in Zone 4. NRG, on behalf of itself and GenOn, filed comments providing its view on the rationale for the market outcome. 

On June 30, 2015, the Illinois Energy Consumers filed a complaint with FERC under Section 206 of the FPA regarding MISO&#8217;s Planning Resource Auction tariff provisions, stating that the current MISO tariff does not produce just and reasonable results. The complaint suggests specific tariff modifications to address these alleged deficiencies, particularly as to the initial reference level price and the failure of the MISO tariff to count capacity sold in neighboring capacity markets toward meeting local clearing requirements in effect for the zones where capacity is physically located. On October 20, 2015, FERC held a technical conference on MISO's Planning Resource Auction, which in part addressed changes to MISO's auction design. 

On December 31, 2015, FERC issued an order directing MISO to change key portions of its capacity market tariff, including restricting the ability of suppliers to place offers up to a MISO-developed opportunity cost. FERC mandated several changes to the auction, to be in place before the next planning resource auction in 2016. MISO is pursuing its own stakeholder reforms process to create different rules and implement price formation reforms as to its restructured retail market zones, including Zone 4. FERC expressly declined to rule on the portion of the complaint addressing the outcome of the 2015 Zone 4 auction, and instead stated that its investigation into the conduct of the auction remained pending. Rehearing is pending. 

&#160; 

Revisions to MISO Capacity Construct &#8212; On November 20, 2015, FERC issued a final order denying the Company&#8217;s request for rehearing of a 2012 FERC order approving the MISO capacity construct. The Company filed a petition for review of FERC&#8217;s decision with the D.C. Circuit on the grounds that FERC&#8217;s order denies merchant generators in MISO&#8217;s footprint any reasonable opportunity to recover their fixed costs. The eventual outcome of this proceeding could impact MISO&#8217;s attempts to redesign its capacity markets and thereby affect the value of NRG&#8217;s uncontracted assets within the MISO footprint. 

West Region 

Select Net Metering Developments &#8212; &#32; In California, the CPUC recently issued an order restructuring net energy metering credits. Central to this decision, the CPUC adopted the following for new rooftop systems: (1) continued to support full retail rates for rooftop solar systems for 20 years; (2) imposed some new minor charges on customers installing new systems and (3) mandated time-of-use, or TOU, retail rates, starting immediately. Today&#8217;s TOU rates generally support the economics of rooftop solar. However, the CPUC has initiated proceedings to develop new TOU rate designs that may lower daytime retail rates and unfavorably affect the economics of installed rooftop solar systems. 

The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada, or PUCN, recently revised the compensation structure for net energy metering rooftop solar customers to raise the amounts paid by these customers on utility bills. The Nevada decision applies to both new and existing solar systems without any grandfathering. However, the Nevada Commission recently agreed to a 12-year phase in for implementation of the new rates. The PUCN&#8217;s decision is currently being appealed. 

CAISO 

Carlsbad Energy Center &#8212; On May 21, 2015, the CPUC approved the Carlsbad Energy Center PPTA for a nominally rated 500 MW five unit natural gas peaking plant. On December 7, 2015, three parties filed two petitions for a writ of review with the California Court of Appeal appealing the CPUC's decision. The petitions remain pending. Additionally, on July 30, 2015, the CEC approved an amendment to the design of the Carlsbad Energy Center. On September 22, 2015, the CEC granted rehearing of its decision approving the amendment to permit the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, or CDFW, to file comments on the proposed decision. On November 12, 2015, the CEC issued an order on rehearing affirming its decision approving the amendment. No party appealed the CEC's decision. 

Puente Power Project &#8212; On January 11, 2016, the CPUC issued a proposed decision by the assigned administrative law judge and an alternate proposed decision by Commissioner Florio addressing, in part, the resource adequacy purchase agreement, or RAPA, between SCE and NRG for the construction of the 262 MW natural gas peaking Puente Power Project. Both the proposed decision and the Florio alternate proposed decision would delay approval of the RAPA until after the CEC has acted on the permit filing for the Puente Power Project. On February 12, 2016, Commissioner Peterman issued an alternate proposed decision which would approve the RAPA without delay. The soonest the three proposed decisions can be taken up by the CPUC is during its March 17, 2016 business meeting. 

&#32; Environmental Matters 

NRG is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of power plants. NRG is also subject to laws regarding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles and threatened and endangered species. Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent and NRG expects this trend to continue. The electric generation industry is facing new requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the Company's operations. Complying with environmental laws involves significant capital and operating expenses. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital. &#160; &#32; 

A number of regulations with the potential to affect the Company and its facilities are in development, under review or have been recently promulgated by the EPA, including ESPS/NSPS for GHGs, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent guidelines. NRG is currently reviewing the outcome and any resulting impact of recently promulgated regulations and cannot fully predict such impact until legal challenges are resolved. 

&#160; 

Air &#160; 

The CAA and the resulting regulations (as well as similar state and local requirements) have the potential to affect air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO 2 , ozone, and PM 2.5 . Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the EPA as not achieving certain NAAQS (non-attainment areas). The relevant NAAQS have become more stringent and NRG expects that trend to continue. The Company expects increased regulation at both the federal and state levels of its air emissions and maintains a comprehensive compliance strategy to address these continuing and new requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent NAAQS may require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economical. Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below. 

Ozone NAAQS &#8212; On October 26, 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule that reduces the ozone NAAQS to 0.070 ppm. This more stringent NAAQS will obligate the states to develop plans to reduce NO x &#32;(an ozone precursor), which could affect some of the Company's units. 

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule &#8212; The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain state obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the D.C. Circuit ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO 2 budgets for four states including Texas and (ii) ozone-season NO x budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. In December 2015, the EPA proposed the CSAPR Update Rule using the 2008 Ozone NAAQS, which would reduce the total amount of ozone season NO x &#32;as compared with the previously utilized 1997 Ozone NAAQS. If finalized, this proposal would reduce future NO x allocations and/or current banked allowances. While NRG cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, the Company believes its investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies coupled with planned plant retirements leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance. 

MATS &#32;&#8212; In February 2012, the EPA promulgated standards (the MATS rule) to control emissions of HAPs from coal and oil-fired electric generating units. The rule established limits for mercury, non-mercury metals, certain organics and acid gases, which limits must be met beginning in April 2015 (with some units getting a 1-year extension). In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of Michigan v. EPA &#32;and held that the EPA unreasonably refused to consider costs when it determined that it was "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emitted by electric generating units. The U.S. Supreme Court did not vacate the MATS rule but rather remanded it to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings. In November 2015, the EPA proposed a supplemental finding that including a consideration of cost does not alter the EPA's previous determination that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate HAPs, including mercury from power plants. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit remanded the MATS rule to the EPA without vacatur. While NRG cannot predict the final outcome of this rulemaking, NRG believes that because it has already invested in pollution controls and cleaner technologies, the fleet is well-positioned to comply with the MATS rule. 

Clean Power Plan &#8212; The national and international attention (including the Paris Agreement) in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal and state legislative and regulatory action. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. The CPP rule faces numerous legal challenges that likely will take several years to resolve. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. 

&#160; 

CO 2 &#32;Emissions &#8212; NRG emits CO 2 &#32;when generating electricity at most of its facilities. The graphs presented below illustrate NRG's U.S. emissions of CO 2 &#32;for 2013, 2014 and 2015. NRG anticipates reductions in its future emissions profile as the Company modernizes the fleet through repowering, improves generation efficiencies, and explores methods to capture CO 2 . By 2030, the Company's goal is to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 50%, using 2014 as a baseline. From 2014 to 2015, the Company's CO 2 emissions decreased from 102 million metric tons to approximately 86 million metric tons, representing a 16% reduction year over year. Factors leading to the decreased emissions include reductions in fleetwide annual net generation due to an overall decrease in market demand and a market-driven shift towards increased generation from natural gas over coal. The Company's goal is to reduce its CO 2 &#32;emissions by 90% by 2050. 

The effects from federal, regional or state regulation of GHGs on the Company's financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including the outcome of the legal challenges, regulatory design, level of GHG reductions, the availability of offsets, and the extent to which NRG would be entitled to receive CO 2 &#32; emissions credits without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market. Thereafter, under any such legislation or regulation, the impact on NRG would depend on the Company's level of success in developing and deploying low and no carbon technologies. 

&#160; Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination 

In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. The Company is evaluating the impact of the new rule on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and has accrued its environmental and asset retirement obligations under the rule based on current estimates as of December 31, 2015. 

Domestic Site Remediation Matters 

Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of any facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at the facility. NRG may be responsible for property damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, or SARA, impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations. Further discussions of affected NRG sites can be found in Item 15 &#8212; Note 24 , Environmental Matters , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Nuclear Waste &#160;&#8212; The federal government's program to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was discontinued in 2010. Since 1998, the U.S. DOE has been in default of the federal government's obligations to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel, or SNF, and high-level radioactive waste, or HLW, under the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, or the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Owners of nuclear plants, including the owners of STP, had been required to enter into contracts setting out the obligations of the owners and the U.S. DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for the U.S. DOE's services to license a spent fuel repository. Effective May 16, 2014, the U.S. DOE stopped collecting the fees. 

On February 5, 2013, STPNOC entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE for payment of damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act through December 31, 2013, which was extended through an addendum dated January 24, 2014, to December 31, 2016. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the U.S., nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. STPNOC currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities in on-site storage pools. Since STPNOC's SNF storage pools do not have sufficient storage capacity for the life of the units, STPNOC is proceeding to construct dry cask storage capability on-site. STPNOC plans to continue to assert claims against the U.S. DOE for damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW. 

Effective October 20, 2014, the NRC issued its Continued Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel rule that determined that licensees can safely store SNF at nuclear power plants beyond the original and renewed licensed operating life of the plants. The rule remains subject to legal challenges. Upon the effective date of the rule, the NRC lifted its suspension of licensing actions on nuclear power plants. 

Under the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended, the state of Texas is required to provide, either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within the state. STP's warehouse capacity is adequate for on-site storage until a site in Andrews County, Texas becomes fully operational. 

Water &#160; 

Clean Water Act &#8212; &#32; The Company is required under the CWA to comply with intake and discharge requirements, requirements for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations are expected to impose additional and more stringent requirements or limitations in the future. This includes requirements governing cooling water intake structures, which are subject to regulation under section 316(b) of the CWA (the 316(b) regulations). In August 2014, EPA finalized the regulation regarding the use of water for once through cooling at existing facilities to address impingement and entrainment concerns. NRG anticipates that more stringent requirements will be incorporated into some of its water discharge permits over the next several years as NPDES permits are renewed. 

Effluent Limitations Guidelines &#8212; In November 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule revising the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which will impose more stringent requirements (as individual permits are renewed) for wastewater streams from flue gas desulfurization, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. The Company estimates that it would cost approximately $200 million over the next eight years (the majority of the cost would be incurred after 2019) to comply with this rule at 11 coal-fired plants. This regulation has been challenged and is subject to legal uncertainty. The Company decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on: the certainty of regulations; evaluation of different technologies; options to convert to gas; and the expected economic returns on the capital. Over the next several years, the Company will decide whether to proceed with these investments at each of the plants as permits are renewed based on, among other things, the legal certainty of the regulation and market conditions at that time. 

Regional Environmental Issues 

East Region 

New Source Review &#8212; The EPA and various states have been investigating compliance of electric generating facilities with the pre-construction permitting requirements of the CAA known as &#8220;new source review,&#8221; or NSR. In 2007, Midwest Generation received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Crawford, Fisk, Joliet, Powerton, Waukegan and Will County generating stations violated NSR and other regulations. These alleged violations are the subject of litigation described in Item 15 &#8212; Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies. &#32;In January 2009, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Keystone, Portland and Shawville generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR. In June 2011, GenOn received an NOV from the EPA alleging that past work at Avon Lake and Niles generating stations violated NSR. In December 2007, the NJDEP filed suit alleging that NSR violations occurred at the Portland generating station, which suit was resolved pursuant to a July 2013 Consent Decree. Additionally, in April 2013, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection issued four NOVs alleging that past work at oil-fired combustion turbines at the Torrington Terminal, Franklin, Branford and Middletown generating stations violated regulations regarding NSR.

Burton Island Old Ash Landfill &#8212; In January 2006, NRG's Indian River Power LLC was notified that it may be a potentially responsible party with respect to Burton Island Old Ash Landfill, a historic captive landfill located at the Indian River facility. On October 1, 2007, NRG signed an agreement with DNREC to investigate the site through the Voluntary Clean-up Program. On February 4, 2008, DNREC issued findings that no further action was required in relation to surface water and that a previously planned shoreline stabilization project would satisfactorily address shoreline erosion. The landfill itself required a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study to determine the type and scope of any additional required work. DNREC approved the Feasibility Study in December 2012. In January 2013, DNREC proposed a remediation plan based on the Feasibility Study. The remediation plan was approved in October 2013. In December 2015, DNREC approved the Company's remediation design and the Company's Long Term Stewardship Plan. The cost of completing the work required by the approved remediation plan is consistent with amounts previously budgeted. 

Additionally, on May 29, 2008, DNREC requested that NRG's Indian River Power LLC participate in the development and performance of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment at the Burton Island Old Ash Landfill. NRG is currently working with DNREC and other trustees to close out the assessment process. 

Maryland Environmental Regulations &#32;&#8212; In December 2014, MDE proposed a regulation regarding NO x &#32;emissions from coal-fired electric generating units, which had it been finalized would have required by 2020 the Company (at each of the three Dickerson coal-fired units and the Chalk Point coal-fired unit that does not have an SCR) to either (1) install and operate an SCR; (2) retire the unit; or (3) convert the fuel source from coal to natural gas. In early 2015, the State of Maryland decided not to finalize the regulation as proposed. In November 2015, MDE finalized revised regulations to address future NO x reductions, which although more stringent than previous regulations, will not cause the Company to spend capital to comply. As a result of the new regulations, on February 29, 2016, NRG notified PJM that it was withdrawing the standing deactivation notices for Dickerson Units 1, 2 and 3 and Chalk Point Units 1 and 2. 

RGGI &#8212; The Company operates generating units in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances, which the Company believes will increase the price of each allowance. The nine RGGI states are re-evaluating the program and may alter the rules to further reduce the number of allowances. The 2013 rules and/or revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Illinois Union Insurance Company Litigation &#8212; On October 2, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana issued an order granting LaGen&#8217;s motion for summary judgment on its claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract against ILU for its failure to indemnify LaGen for the costs LaGen paid pursuant to the consent decree that resolved the NSR lawsuit which was brought by the U.S. EPA and LA DEQ against LaGen related to Big Cajun II. The court entered judgment in favor of LaGen for approximately $27 million. In addition, the court ruled that LaGen is entitled to approximately $7 million for future consent decree costs as they are incurred. On October 14, 2015, ILU filed a motion to stay execution of the judgment, which was granted on October 19, 2015. Also, on October 14, 2015, ILU filed a notice to appeal the judgment. On January 14, 2016, the U.S. District Court granted LaGen's motion for attorney's fees of approximately $2 million for the indemnity phase of the litigation. On January 29, 2016, ILU filed their appeal brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 

Texas Regional Haze &#8212; In January 2016, the EPA promulgated a final rule that requires 15 coal-fired units (at eight plants in Texas) to reduce their SO 2 &#32;rates at various times over the next five years. This Regional Haze rule was promulgated under the portion of the CAA that seeks to improve visibility at national parks. Eight of these 15 units already have scrubbers and seven do not. NRG owns two of the affected units, Limestone units 1 and 2, which already have scrubbers. The rule requires that the Limestone units reduce their SO 2 &#32;emission rates by 2019. NRG is analyzing the rule as well as exploring what scrubber upgrades and/or operational changes would be most economic to improve the SO 2 &#32;rates of Limestone units 1 and 2. If this rule survives legal challenges, NRG anticipates that the affected coal units that do not have scrubbers (none of which belong to NRG) likely would retire by the first quarter of 2021 (but some possibly sooner). 

Jewett Mine Closure Costs &#8212; &#32; NRG is party to a long-term contract with Texas Westmoreland Coal Co., or TWCC, under which TWCC provides the lignite used to fuel NRG&#8217;s Limestone facility, which is obtained from the Jewett mine, a surface mine adjacent to the Limestone facility. The contract is based on a cost-plus arrangement with incentives and penalties to ensure proper management of the mine. TWCC, the operator of the mine, is responsible for performing reclamation activities at the mine. NRG is responsible for mine reclamation cost obligations and maintains an appropriate ARO.

Environmental Capital Expenditures 

NRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2016 through 2020 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $350 million &#32;which includes $68 million &#32;for GenOn and $263 million for Midwest Generation. These costs, the majority of which will be expended by the end of 2016, are primarily associated with (i) DSI/ESP upgrades at the Powerton facility and the Joliet gas conversion to satisfy the IL CPS and (ii) MATS compliance at the Avon Lake facility. 

Customers 

NRG sells to a wide variety of customers. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of NRG's total revenue in 2015. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company also directly sells to end-use customers in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , NRG had 10,468 &#32;employees, approximately 27% &#32;of whom were covered by U.S. bargaining agreements. During 2015 , the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.
