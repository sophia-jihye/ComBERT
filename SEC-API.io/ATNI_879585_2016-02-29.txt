 ITEM 1. BUSINES S 

Overvie w 

We are a holding company that, through our operating subsidiaries, (i) provides wireless and wireline telecommunications services in North America, Bermuda and the Caribbean, (ii) owns and operates commercial distributed generation solar power systems in the United States, and (iii) owns and operates terrestrial and submarine fiber optic transport systems in the United States and the Caribbean, respectively. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1987 and began trading publicly in 1991. Since that time, we have engaged in strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our operations. We continue to actively evaluate additional domestic and international acquisition and investment opportunities and other strategic transactions in the telecommunications, energy &#8209;related and other industries that meet our return &#8209;on &#8209;investment and other acquisition criteria. For a discussion of our investment strategy and risks involved, see &#8220; Risk Factors&#8212;We are actively evaluating investment, acquisition and other strategic opportunities, which may affect our long &#8209;term growth prospects .&#8221; 

We offer the following principal services: 

&#183; 

Wireless. In the United States, we offer wholesale wireless voice and data roaming services to national, regional, local and selected international wireless carriers in rural markets located principally in the Southwest and Midwest United States. We also offer wireless voice and data services to retail customers in Bermuda, Guyana, and in other smaller markets in the Caribbean and the United States. 

&#183; 

Wireline. Our local telephone and data services include our operations in Guyana and the mainland United States. We are the exclusive licensed provider of domestic wireline local and long &#8209;distance telephone services in Guyana and international voice and data communications into and out of Guyana. We also offer facilities &#8209;based integrated voice and data communications services and wholesale transport services to enterprise and residential customers in New England, primarily Vermont, and in New York State. In addition, we offer wholesale long &#8209;distance voice services to telecommunications carriers. 

&#183; 

Renewable Energy. In the United States, we provide distributed generation solar power to corporate, utility and municipal customers in Massachusetts, California and New Jersey. 

We provide management, technical, financial, regulatory, and marketing services to our subsidiaries and typically receive a management fee equal to a percentage of their revenues, which is eliminated in consolidation. For information about our financial segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and assets, see Notes 1 and 1 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 

Our principal corporate offices are located at 600 Cummings Center, Beverly, Massachusetts, 01915. The telephone number at our principal corporate offices is (978) 619 &#8209;1300. 

Strateg y 

The key elements of our strategy consist of the following: 

&#183; 

Target Under &#8209;served Markets or Industries Where We Can Compete Successfully. We operate our telecommunications businesses primarily in smaller, rural or under &#8209;served markets where we believe we are or will be one of the leading providers of telecommunications services. Our pending transactions in the US Virgin Islands and Bermuda provide us with the opportunity and scale to build out our services in key geographies where we see the opportunity to create long term value. Our businesses typically have strong local brand identities and market positions. By leveraging these attributes, along with our lower cost of capital and our senior management expertise at the holding company level, we seek to improve and expand 

&#160;

available products and services in our targeted markets to better meet the needs of our customers and expand our customer base and revenues. We are particularly interested in investing in businesses that have the potential to provide a platform for future organic and strategic growth. Our solar company investments have afforded us entry into an emerging industry in which we believe there are attractive investment return opportunities and the potential to expand our business. 

&#183; 

Collaborate with Local Management. We believe that strong local management enhances our close relationship with customers and reduces risk. Wherever feasible, we seek to partner with local investors, owners or management teams who have demonstrated a successful track record or have extensive knowledge of the industry. We seek to enhance our strong market position by maintaining these relationships and by leveraging our comprehensive management experience and technical and financial expertise to assist them in further improving operations. 

&#183; 

Maintain a Disciplined Earnings &#8209;Oriented Approach. We carefully assess the potential for earnings stability and growth when we evaluate the performance of our subsidiaries, new investment opportunities and prospective acquisitions or dispositions. In managing our more mature businesses, we seek to solidify our brands, improve customer satisfaction, add new services, control costs and preserve cash flow. In managing newer, early &#8209;stage businesses, we seek to invest capital to improve our competitive position, increase market share and generate strong revenue and cash flow potential. We consider new investments, acquisitions and dispositions on a disciplined, return &#8209;on &#8209;investment basis. 

Acquisitions 

Caribbean Asset Holdings LLC 

&#160; 

On September 30, 2015, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the membership interests of Caribbean Asset Holdings LLC, the holding company for the Innovative group of companies operating cable TV, Internet and landline services primarily in the U.S. Virgin Islands (&#8220;Innovative&#8221;), from the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (&#8220;CFC&#8221;). We will purchase the Innovative operations for a purchase price of approximately $145.0 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments (th e &#8220;Innovative Transaction&#8221;). In connection with the purchase, we have the option to finance up to $60 million of the purchase price with a loan from an affiliate of CFC, the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (&#8220;RTFC&#8221;) on the terms and conditions set forth in a commitment letter and rate lock option letter executed by RTFC filed herewith as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2, respectively. We expect t o fund the remaining $85.0 million of the purchase price, plus any amounts not financed, in cash. With the purchase, our current operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands under the &#8220;Choice&#8221; name, will be combined with Innovative to deliver residential and business subscribers a full range of telecommunications and media services. 

&#160; 

The Innovative Transaction is subject to customary closing terms and conditions and the receipt of approvals from the Federal Communications Commission and regulatory authorities in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and St. Maarten. We currently expect to comp lete the proposed transaction in mid-2016. 

&#160; 

KeyTech Limited 

&#160; 

On October 5 , 2015, we entered into an agreement with KeyTech Limited (&#8220;KeyTech&#8221;), a &#160; publicly held &#160; Bermuda company &#160; listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange (&#8220;BSX&#8221;) &#160; that provides broadband and cable television services and other telecommunications services to residential and enterprise customers under the &#8220;Logic&#8221; name in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, in which we will acquire a controlling interest in KeyTech as part of a proposed business combination of KeyTech with our subsidiary providing wireless services under the &#8220;CellOne&#8221; name in Bermuda (the &#8220;KeyTech Transaction&#8221;). KeyTech currently owns a 43.0% interest in CellOne, and as part of the KeyTech Transaction, we will contribute our current ownership interest of approximately &#160; 43% &#160; in CellOne and approximately &#160; $42.0 &#160; million in cash in exchange for a &#160; 51% ownership interest in KeyTech. &#160; We currently own on a combined basis with KeyTech &#160; approximately &#160; 85% &#160; of CellOne. &#160; As part of the KeyTech Transaction, CellOne will be merged with and into a company within the KeyTech group and the approximate &#160; 15% &#160; interest in CellOne held, in the aggregate, by CellOne&#8217;s minority shareholders will be converted into the right to receive common shares in KeyTech. 

&#160;

Following the transaction, CellOne will be indirectly wholly owned by KeyTech &#160; and KeyTech will continue to be listed on the BSX. &#160; A portion of the cash proceeds that KeyTech will receive upon closing will be used to fund a one-time special dividend to KeyTech&#8217;s existing shareholders and to retire KeyTech&#8217;s subordinated debt. &#160; We currently consolidate the operations of CellOne and, upon closing of the KeyTech Transaction, will consolidate the results of KeyTech, in our financial statements. 

&#160; 

The KeyTech Transaction is subject to customary closing terms and conditions, including, among others, the receipt of approval from the Bermuda Regulatory Authority, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Information and Communications Technology Authority of the Cayman Islands and the consent of the Bermuda Stock Exchange to certain transaction matters. KeyTech shareholders approved the proposed transaction by affirmative vote on October 20, 2015. We are working towards completing the proposed transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Service s 

Wireless Service s 

We provide mobile wireless voice and data communications services in the United States, Bermuda and the Caribbean. Our revenues from wireless s ervices were approximately 67 % of our consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2015. Currently, the U.S. portion of our business constitutes a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. Our revenues from U.S. wireless services were approximately 37%, 46%, and 44% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Our U.S. wireless service revenues have historically had high operating margins and therefore have contributed a large percentage of operating income. 

U.S. Wireless Segment 

In the United States, we provide wholesale wireless voice and data roaming services in rural markets to national, regional, local and selected international wireless carriers. Our largest wholesale networks are located principally in the western United States. We also offer wireless voice and data services to retail customers in certain rural markets already covered by our wholesale networks. 

Services. The revenue and profits of our U.S. wholesale wireless business are primarily driven by the number of sites and base stations in operation, the amount of voice and data traffic that each of these sites generates, and the rates we receive from our carrier customers on that traffic. Many of our sites are located in popular tourist and seasonal visitor areas, which has resulted in higher wholesale revenues in those areas during the summer months. 

We currently have roaming agreements with approximately 50 United States &#8209; based wireless service providers and, as of December 31, 2015, had roaming arrangements with each of the four U.S. national wireless network operators: AT&#38;T, Sprint, T &#8209;Mobile and Verizon Wireless. Other than the agreements with the national carriers, our standard roaming agreements are usually terminable within 90 days. Occasionally, we may agree or strategically decide to lower rates or build a new mobile network at a specified location as part of a long &#8209;term roaming agreement to offer our roaming partner pricing certainty in exchange for priority designation with respect to their customers&#8217; wireless traffic. Once we complete building a rural network, we then benefit from the use of that network under existing roaming agreements with other international, national, regional, and local carriers to supplement our initial revenues. In 2015, the four national wireless service providers together accounted for a substantial portion of our wholesale wireless revenues, with AT&#38;T and Verizon accounting for 17% and 19%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenue for the year. 

Network and Operations. Our roaming network uses GSM/UMTS technology that often will be deployed at a single cell site location along with CDMA/EVDO coverage in order to maximize revenue opportunities. The majority of our GSM/GPRS sites have been upgraded to UMTS/HSPA. In 2016, we plan to complete the efforts we began in the 2013 fiscal year to other advanced mobile technologies in many areas. Our networks comprise base stations and radio transceivers located on owned or leased towers and buildings, telecommunications switches and leased transport facilities. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we o wned and operated a total of approximately 800 domestic base stations on nearly 520 owned and leased sites, a Network Operations Center (or &#8220;NOC&#8221;) and a switching center. Our switching center routes calls, supervises call originations and terminations at cell sites and manages call handoffs. This location also houses platforms that enable our customers to use a variety of services, including text messaging, picture messaging, voice mail and data services. Our NOC provides dedicated, 24 &#8209;hour, year &#8209;round monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers. In 2015, we continued to expand and improve our network, adding nearly 100 new base stations and approximately 45 new sites and upgrading 40 sites to more advanced mobile data technologies. 

Competition. We compete with wireless service providers that operate networks in our markets and offer wholesale roaming services. However, the most significant competitive challenge we face in our U.S. wholesale wireless business is the extent to which our carrier customers choose not to roam on our networks or elect to build or acquire their own infrastructure in a market in which we operate, reducing or eliminating their need for our services in those markets. We address this competitive threat mainly by providing a service that would be more costly for the carrier to provide itself, or, at least, a less attractive expenditure than alternative investments in its network or business elsewhere. 

Occasionally, we have entered into buildout projects with existing carrier customers to help the customer accelerate the buildout of a given area. Pursuant to these arrangements, we agree to incur the cost of building and operating a network in a newly designated area meeting specified conditions. In exchange, the carrier agrees to license us spectrum in that area and enter into a contract with specific pricing and term. These arrangements typically include a purchase right in favor of the carrier to purchase that portion of the network and receive back the spectrum for a predetermined price, depending on when the option to purchase is exercised. For example, as previously disclosed in December 2012, we sold a portion of our network to a carrier customer pursuant to a n option contained in a roaming and buildout agreement with that carrier. We currently have one buildout arrangement of approximately 100 built cell sites that provides the carrier with an option to purchase such sites exercisable beginning in 2018. This portion of network accounted for approximately $13.4 million in wholesale revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. At this time, we cannot predict when or whether the purchase option will be exercised. 

Our ability to maintain appropriate capacity and relevant technology to respond to our roaming partners&#8217; needs also shapes our competitive profile in the markets in which we operate. 

Island Wireless Segment 

We provide wireless voice and data service to retail and business customers in Bermuda under the &#8220;CellOne&#8221; name, and in the U.S. Virgin Islands and in Aruba under different brand names. We also provide roaming services for many of the largest U.S. providers&#8217; customers visiting these islands. Following the consummation of our Innovative and KeyTech Transactions, we intend to expand our operations in Bermuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands to include television, internet and phone services in addition to our existing wireless services. 

Products and Services. In Bermuda, a majority of our customers subscribe to one of our postpaid plans, which allow customers to select a plan with a given amount of voice minutes, text messaging, data and other features that recur on a monthly basis. A substantial majority of our customers in other markets in our Island Wireless segment subscribe to our prepaid plans, which require customers to purchase an amount of voice minutes, text messages or data prior to use. In the U.S. Virgin Islands and other island markets, we also provide Internet access services via a variety of wireless broadband technologies. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately 53,000 retail subscribers in our Island Wireless segment. 

&#160;

Network. We currently operate multiple advanced wireless voice and data technologies in our island markets in the 850 and 1900 MHz frequency bands, including GSM/EDGE, UMTS/HSPA+ and CDMA/EVDO and plan t o add LTE technology in certain of our markets in 2016. We have extensive backbone facilities linking our sites, switching facilities and international interconnection points. Off &#8209;island connectivity is provided by leased, fiber &#8209;based interconnections. 

Sales and Marketing. We maintain retail stores in our markets and allow customers to pay their bills and &#8220;top up&#8221;, or add additional minutes to their prepaid plans, through payment terminals at local stores or our website. We advertise frequently through print and electronic media, radio station spots and sponsor various events and initiatives. 

Handsets and Accessories. We offer a diverse line &#8209;up of wireless devices and accessories designed to meet both the personal and professional needs of our customers. Our device assortment includes a wide range of smartphones including those featuring the Android and IOS operating systems in addition to a full line of feature phones, wireless hot spots and various wireless solutions for small businesses. To complement our phone offerings, we sell a complete range of original equipment manufacturer and after &#8209;market accessories that allow our customers to personalize their wireless experience, including phone protection, battery charging solutions and Bluetooth hands &#8209;free kits. 

Competition. We believe we compete for wireless retail customers in our island properties based on features, price, technology deployed, network coverage (including through roaming arrangements), quality of service and customer care. We compete against Digicel, which is a large mobile telecommunications company in the Caribbean region, and in some markets, against one or more U.S. national operators or the wireless division of the incumbent telephone companies. 

International Integrated Telephony Segment 

A portion of our International Integrated Telephony segment includes wireless telephone service we offer in Guyana. We offer these services in the vast majority of populated areas, including Georgetown (Guyana&#8217;s capital and largest city) and the surrounding area and substantially all of the country&#8217;s coastal plain where the majority of its population is concentrated. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 230,000 wireless subscribers. As of December 31, 2015, more than 96% of our wireless subscribers in Guyana were on prepaid plans. 

Network. Our GSM network operates in the 900 MHz band and in the 1800 MHz band. We estimate that substantially all of the country&#8217;s population resides in areas covered by our wireless network. 

Sales and Marketing. We offer our wireless postpaid subscribers various calling plans and charge monthly fees plus airtime based on the selected plan. In September 2015, we re-branded our services and revealed an updated logo and branding, and refurnished sales locations to our customers. In addition to our retail stores, our customers may set up accounts at one of our six business centers. Our handsets, prepaid cards and prepaid accounts are sold primarily through independent dealers that we pay on a commission basis. Payments by our prepaid customers can be made by the purchase of disposable prepaid calling car ds, which come in fixed Guyana dollar amounts, or by recharging an account at an authorized vendor location . 

Competition. We provide wireless services in Guyana pursuant to a non &#8209;exclusive license. Digicel, our competitor, entered the market in late 2006 and has used an aggressive marketing approach to acquire, and now retain, market share. However, our continued investments in our network and customer offerings have enabled us to retain substantially all of our market share of customers. We believe we compete for customers primarily based on price, promotions, coverage and quality of service. 

Wireline Service s 

Our wireline services include operations in Guyana and the mainland United States. Our revenues from wireline services were approximately 29%, 25% and 24% of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160;

International Integrated Telephony Segment 

A portion of our International Integrated Telephony segment consists of wireline services we provide in Guyana, where we are the exclusive licensed provider of domestic wireline local and long &#8209;distance telephone services into and out of the country. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 154,000 access lines in service, which represent both residential and commercial subscribers. Of all fixed lines in service, the majority are in the largest urban areas, including Georgetown, Linden, New Amsterdam, Diamond and Beterverwagting. As a result of our continued network expansion into smaller communities, and more recently, newly developed housing areas and residential parks, residential customers now account for approximately two &#8209;thirds of the wireline local telephone service revenue while commercial customers account for approximately one &#8209;third. We also provide broadband service in Guyana, which accounted for 16 % of our revenues in our International Integrated Telephony segment in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 43,000 Internet customers. 

With respect to our international long &#8209;distance business, we collect payment s from foreign carriers for handling international long &#8209;distance calls originating from the foreign carriers&#8217; country and terminating in Guyana. We also make payments to foreign carriers for international calls from Guyana terminating in the foreign carrier&#8217;s country and are entitled to collect from our subscribers (and from competing wireless carriers) a rate that is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission (&#8220;PUC&#8221;) of Guyana. 

Network. All of our fixed access lines are digitally switched from our switching center in Georgetown, Guyana. Our switching center provides dedicated monitoring of our network to ensure quality and reliable service to our customers. 

Our international long &#8209;distance network is linked with the rest of the world principally through our fiber &#8209;optic submarine cable into Guyana, through our ownership of a portion of the Americas II undersea fiber &#8209;optic cable and by leasing capacity on several other cables. The Suriname &#8209;Guyana Submarine Cable System, which we co &#8209;own with Telesur, the government &#8209;owned telecommunications provider in Suriname, provides us with more robust redundancy, the capacity to meet growing data demands in Guyana, and the opportunity to provide new and enhanced IP centric services such as Internet service. We also lease capacity on Intelsat satellites and have two Standard B earth stations, which provide both international and local backhaul services. 

Sales and Marketing. Our revenues for fixed access domestic service are derived from installation charges for new lines, monthly line rental charges, monthly measured service charges based on the number and duration of calls and other charges for maintenance and other customer services. For each category of revenues, rates differ for residential and commercial customers and are set by regulatory authorities. We employ a minimal sales force for our basic wireline offering, as wireline sales are primarily driven by network expansion and availability of service. Customers can pay their bills at any one of our six business centers, any Western Union branch, commercial banks and post offices. 

Competition. We have the exclusive right to provide domestic fixed and international voice and data services in Guyana. As the initial term of our license was scheduled to expire in December 2010, we notified the Government of Guyana of our election to renew our exclusive license for an additional 20 year term expiring in 2030 and received return correspondence from the Government that our exclusive license had been renewed until such time that new legislation is in place with regard to the Government&#8217;s intention to introduce competition into the sector. We believe, however, our exclusive license continues to be valid unless and until such time as we enter into an alternative agreement with the Government. See &#8220;&#8212;Guyana Regulation&#8212;Regulatory Developments&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our exclusive license to provide local exchange and international voice and data services in Guyana is subject to significant political and regulatory risk.&#8221; 

U.S. Wireline Segment 

We are a leading provider of competitive integrated voice and broadband data communications and wholesale transport services in Vermont, New York and New Hampshire. 

&#160;

Network. We provide voice and data services using a network comprising telecommunications switching and related equipment that we own and telecommunications lines that we typically lease from the incumbent telephone company. We operate high capacity fiber &#8209;optic ring networks in Vermont and New York State that we use to connect our enterprise markets and to provide wholesale data transport services to other carriers. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 260,000 business and 6,000 residential access line equivalents (&#8220;ALEs&#8221;), in billing. ALEs are calculated by determining the number of individual voice or data lines, in 64 kbps segments, that generate a monthly recurring charge within an end user circuit or circuits. As of December 31, 2015, we also provided broadband services to approximately 3,700 accounts in Vermont and western New Hampshire. 

In 2010, we received two grants from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce to expand our existing network by constructing ten new segments of a 1,300 mile fiber &#8209;optic, middle &#8209;mile broadband infrastructure in upstate New York and to construct and operate a 773 mile fiber &#8209;optic middle mile network in Vermont. Our New York project was completed in 2013 and our Vermont project was completed in 2014. 

Sales and Marketing. We sell our services primarily through a direct sales force that assists customers in choosing tailored solutions for their specific communication needs. Our direct sales staff focuses on selling integrated voice and data to small and medium &#8209;sized businesses and other organizations, while residential services are largely sold through advertising and word of mouth. We advertise on television and radio through cooperative arrangements and engage in other promotional activities from time to time. 

Our wholesale transport and capacity customers are predominately telecommunications carriers such as local exchange carriers, wireless carriers and interstate integrated providers, which are served by our direct sales force. We expect to expand our customer base in New York State to include more large &#8209; scale end users such as large enterprises, governmental agencies and educational institutions, and with the completion of our Vermont stimulus project build in 2014, to add wholesale transport and capacity customers in Vermont. 

Competition. We compete for retail customers by offering customized voice and data solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our two targeted subsets of customers by providing superior customer service and competitive pricing. Our primary retail competitor is Fairpoint Communications, which acquired the incumbent local exchange business of Verizon Communications in northern New England. We also compete with cable companies, such as Comcast, and other competitive service providers who target small and medium sized businesses. Our wholesale competitors include Level 3 and Verizon Communications, other regional wholesale providers and cable television companies that operate fiber &#8209;optic networks. 

Renewable Energy Service s 

On December 24, 2014, we acquired a provider of distributed generation solar power services in the United States, specifically, in Massachusetts, California and New Jersey (the &#8220;Ahana Acquisition&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015, we owned and operated 28 commercial solar projects at 59 sites (each, a &#8220;Facility&#8221;) with an aggregate 45.8 megawatts DC (&#8220;MWs&#8221;) of electricity generating capacity. We own the Facilities through various indirect subsidiaries that were formed for the purpose of financing the development of, and owning and operating, the Facilities (the &#8220;Special Purpose Entities&#8221;). 

&#160;

Services. Generally, our solar projects are in the &#8220;commercial and industrial&#8221; (C&#38;I) sector of the solar market, which is distinguished from utilities and residential customers. Our customers or &#8220;offtakers&#8221; include high &#8209;credit quality corporates, utilities, schools, and municipalities, which purchase electricity from us under the terms of long &#8209;term power purchase agreements (&#8220;PPAs&#8221;). Each Facility is built on the customer&#8217;s owned or leased site and reduces the customer&#8217;s dependence on traditional energy suppliers, thereby mitigating the price volatility often associated with traditional energy suppliers and transmissions systems. Our PPA terms range from ten to twenty &#8209;five years in duration and are typically priced at or below local retail electricity rates, allowing the customer to secure electricity at predictable and stable prices over the duration of their long &#8209;term contract. As such, the PPAs provide us with high &#8209;quality contracted cash flows, which will continue over their average remaining life, weighted by MWs, of 13.4 years as of December 31, 2015. Certain of our PPAs provide for early termination for a variety of reasons, including in the event that (a) an offtaker is unable to appropriate funds from state and local governments, (b) there is a change of law that substantially reduces the value of utility credits, (c) termination for convenience, or (d) the Facility causes damage to the premises or roof and our customer fails to repair or causes the customer to be in violation of law, or the customer ceases to hold tenancy or fee interest in the premises. All of our Facilities have been in commercial operation for at least two years and are located as follows:

In developing each solar project, we facilitate the project&#8217;s design, development and construction and obtain project &#8209;level financing, and we take a controlling interest in the Special Purpose Entity that owns the project Facility in exchange for a PPA. Our solar projects may be financed using a combination of tax equity, bank financing that we secure and our cash on hand. A substantial majority of our acquired Facilities received tax equity financing, pursuant to which third party investors hold equity in the Special Purpose Entities that were formed to finance the development of, and own and operate, such Facilities. In return, the tax equity investors receive a preferred return on their investment up to a contractually agreed amount and the benefits of various tax credits those Facilities generate. In addition, the Facilities located in California receive revenue from performance based incentive payments (&#8220;PBIs&#8221;) and those located in Massachusetts and New Jersey receive revenue from the sale of solar renewable energy credit (&#8220;SREC&#8221;) contracts, which revenue we retain as the Facilities&#8217; operator. In the future, we intend to focus on growing our project portfolio through additional investments with favorable credit quality offtakers in markets that offer favorable government policies to encourage renewable energy projects and where our projects can generate electricity at a cost that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from traditional energy sources. 

We contract with utilities through an interconnection agreement to export excess energy generated by our Facilities to another offtaker and/or the utility electrical grid. 

Infrastructure. 

Our existing Facilities are comprised of rooftop, ground &#8209;mounted and elevated solar support structure photovoltaic (&#8220;PV&#8221;) installations. Our Facilities are located on our customers&#8217; buildings, parking structures, landfill sites and other locations pursuant to leases or easements granted to us by our customers. These Facilities use crystalline silicon PV modules mounted in ballasted, tracking or roof penetrating fixed &#8209;tilt configurations. All of our existing Facilities were designed, engineered and constructed by Borrego Solar Systems, Inc. (&#8220;Borrego&#8221;), a former sister company of our acquired solar operations, pursuant to engineering, procurement and construction, or &#8220;EPC&#8221;, agreements. Borrego now also maintains our Facilities at a committed fee through long &#8209;term Operations and Maintenance Agreements (&#8220;O&#38;M Agreements&#8221;). Each O&#38;M Agreement commits Borrego to provide maintenance of a Facility for ten years after such Facility is placed in service, including systems monitoring and troubleshooting, inspection, preventative maintenance and any other services on an as &#8209;needed basis at our request at an additional cost. 

&#160;

We are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for the PV modules that we purchase for installation at our Facilities, with the majority of Facilities constructed with PV modules supplied by Yingli Green Energy Holding Company Limited, a Chinese company that sources cells from Taiwanese manufactures and assembles them in China. Typically, the PV modules carry materials and workmanship warranties from 5 &#8209;10 years in duration, with power warranties for a 25 &#8209;year useful life. 

Competition. 

We compete with the traditional electric power industry, as well as with other solar energy companies that may have greater financial resources or brand name recognition than we do, disadvantaging our ability to attract new customers. The solar energy industry is highly competitive and continually evolving and as such, we expect to compete for future project opportunities with new entrants in the distribution solar energy generation industry as well. We believe that we compete with the traditional utilities primarily based on price and the predictability of that price, while we compete with other solar energy providers based on our ability to structure the development and financing of a project for our potential customers or developers on favorable terms. 

Employee s 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,200 employees, of whom approximately 400 were employed in the United States (including in the U.S. Virgin Islands). At the holding company level, we employ our executive management team and staff. More than half of our Guyana full &#8209;time work force is represented by the Guyana Postal and Telecommunications Workers Union. We do not have any other union employees at this time, however, will employ additional union employees after we complete our pending transactions. We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

Regulation 

Our telecommunications operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide services. The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed federal, state, local, and foreign regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses. Legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future and legislative or regulatory requirements may be adopted by those jurisdictions that currently have none. Any such changes could impose new obligations on us that would adversely affect our operating results. 

U.S. Federal Regulatio n 

Our wireless and wireline operations in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands are governed by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (or &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;), the implementing regulations adopted thereunder by the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;), judicial and regulatory decisions interpreting and implementing the Communications Act, and other federal statutes. Our solar operations are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) and the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. 

Wireless Services 

The FCC regulates, among other things; the licensed and unlicensed use of radio spectrum; the ownership, lease, transfer of control and assignment of wireless licenses; the ongoing technical, operational and service requirements applicable to such licenses; the timing, nature and scope of network construction; the provision of certain services, such as E &#8209;911; and the interconnection of communications networks in the United States. 

Licenses. We provide our wireless services under various commercial mobile radio services (or &#8220;CMRS&#8221;) licenses, such as cellular, broadband Personal Communications Services (or &#8220;PCS&#8221;) or 700 MHz licenses, and broadband radio service (or &#8220;BRS&#8221;) licenses granted by the FCC and pursuant to leases of spectrum from FCC &#8209;licensed operators. Some of these licenses are site &#8209; based while others cover specified geographic market areas, typically Cellular 

&#160;

Market Areas (or &#8220;CMAs&#8221;) and Basic Trading Areas (or &#8220;BTAs&#8221;), as defined by the FCC. The technical and service rules, the specific radio frequencies and the authorized spectrum amounts vary depending on the licensed service. The FCC generally allocates CMRS and BRS licenses through periodic auctions, after determining how many licenses to make available in particular frequency ranges, the applicable service rules, and the terms on which the license auction will be conducted. Such licenses are also available via secondary market mechanisms, using procedures and regulations set forth by the FCC. There is no certainty as to whether or not such additional spectrum will be made available for wireless broadband services, the amount of spectrum that might ultimately be made available, the timing of the auction of any such spectrum, the likely configuration of any such additional spectrum and conditions that might apply to it, or the usability of any of this spectrum for wireless services competitive with our services or by us. 

Construction Obligations. The FCC conditions licenses on the satisfaction of certain obligations to construct networks covering a specified geographic area or population by specific dates. The obligations vary depending on the licensed service. Failure to satisfy an applicable construction requirement can result in the assessment of fines and forfeitures by the FCC, a reduced license term, or automatic license cancellation. We are in compliance with the applicable construction requirements that have arisen for the licenses we currently hold and expect to meet our future construction requirements as well. If we do not meet initial construction requirements in December of 2016 for our 700 MHz licenses, or obtain a waiver of the construction requirements, the license term for such licenses will be shortened to June of 2017, and, we may be subject to fines and forfeitures and/or a reduction of our licensed service area. If we fail to meet the build out requirements by the end of the license term for our 700 MHz licenses, we will lose our authority to serve any unserved area within our 700 MHz licensed area and also could be subject to fines and forfeitures, including a revocation of our 700 MHz licenses. We currently expect to meet the build out or waiver requirements with respect to our 700 MHz licenses. 

With respect to some of our licenses, if we were to discontinue operation of a wireless system for a period of time, (at least 90 consecutive days for cellular licenses), our license for that area would be automatically forfeited. 

License Renewals. Our FCC licenses generally expire between 2015 and 2019 and are renewable upon application to the FCC. License renewal applications may be denied if the FCC determines, after appropriate notice and hearing, that renewal would not serve the public interest, convenience, or necessity. At the time of renewal, if we can demonstrate that we have provided &#8220;substantial&#8221; service during the past license term and have complied with the Communications Act and applicable FCC rules and policies, then the FCC will award a renewal expectancy to us and will generally renew our existing licenses without considering any competing applications. The FCC defines &#8220;substantial&#8221; service as service that is sound, favorable and substantially above a level of mediocre service that might only minimally warrant renewal. If we do not receive a renewal expectancy, then the FCC will accept competing applications for the license and conduct a comparative hearing. In that situation, the FCC may award the license to another applicant. While our licenses have been renewed regularly by the FCC in the past, there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future. 

In 2011, the FCC, in a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (&#8220;NPRM&#8221;), proposed to establish more consistent requirements for the renewal of licenses, uniform policies governing discontinuances of service, and to clarify certain construction obligations across all of the wireless service bands. The proposed changes to the applicable renewal and discontinuance of service requirements may be applied to existing licenses that will be renewed in the future. We are unable to predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of this wireless renewal standards proceeding. 

The FCC may deny license applications and, in extreme cases, revoke licenses if it finds that an entity lacks the requisite qualifications to be a licensee. In making that determination, the FCC considers whether an applicant or licensee has been the subject of adverse findings in a judicial or administrative proceeding involving felonies, the possession or sale of unlawful drugs, fraud, antitrust violations, or unfair competition, employment discrimination, misrepresentations to the FCC or other government agencies, or serious violations of the Communications Act or FCC regulations. To our knowledge, there are no activities and no judicial or administrative proceedings involving either us or the licensees in which we hold a controlling interest that would warrant such a finding by the FCC. 

License Acquisitions. Prior FCC approval typically is required for transfers or assignments of a controlling interest in any license or construction permit, or of any rights thereunder. The FCC may approve or prohibit such 

&#160;

transactions altogether, or approve subject to certain conditions such as divestitures or other requirements. Non &#8209;controlling minority interests in an entity that holds an FCC license generally may be bought or sold without FCC approval, subject to any applicable FCC notification requirements. The FCC permits licensees to lease spectrum to third parties under certain conditions, subject to prior FCC approval, or in some instances, notification to the FCC. These mechanisms provide additional flexibility for wireless providers to structure transactions and create additional business and investment opportunities. 

The FCC no longer caps the amount of CMRS spectrum in which an entity may hold an attributable interest and now engages in a case &#8209;by &#8209;case review of proposed wireless transactions, including spectrum acquired via auction, to ensure that the proposed transaction serves the public interest and would not result in a rule violation or an undue concentration of market power. 

In reviewing proposed transactions that involve the transfer or assignment of mobile wireless spectrum, the FCC utilizes a spectrum aggregation screen to determine whether the transaction requires additional scrutiny. The FCC in June 2014 adopted an Order which updated the spectrum screen that the FCC uses in order to conduct its competitive review of proposed secondary market transactions. The FCC&#8217;s Order continued the FCC&#8217;s policy of conducting a case &#8209;by &#8209;case analysis of a combined entity&#8217;s spectrum screen holdings for proposed transactions, revised its existing spectrum screen to reflect the current suitability and availability of spectrum for mobile wireless services, and adopted certain limitations with respect to the purchase and transfer of 600 MHz spectrum. A transaction will trigger additional FCC scrutiny if it will result in the geographic overlap of CMRS spectrum in a given area that is equal to or in excess of 141 MHz, 163.5 MHz, 171 MHz, or 194 MHz, depending on the availability of BRS and Advanced Wireless Services (or &#8220;AWS&#8221;) spectrum in an overlap area. A transaction will also be reviewed by the FCC with heightened scrutiny if it will result in the resulting entity having over 45 MHz of spectrum under 1 GHz. The FCC&#8217;s additional scrutiny would also be triggered if a proposed transaction results in a material change in the post &#8209;transaction market share in a particular market as measured by the Herfindahl &#8209;Hirschman Index. We are well below the spectrum aggregation screen in the geographic areas in which we hold or have access to licenses, and thus we may be able to acquire additional spectrum either from the FCC in an auction or from third parties in private transactions. Similarly, our competitors may be able to strengthen their operations by making additional acquisitions of spectrum in our markets or by further consolidating the industry. 

Other Requirements. The Communications Act and the FCC&#8217;s rules impose a number of additional requirements upon wireless service providers. A failure to meet or maintain compliance with the Communications Act and/or the FCC&#8217;s rules may subject us to fines, forfeitures, penalties or other sanctions. 

Wireless licensees must satisfy a variety of FCC requirements relating to technical and reporting matters. Licensees must often coordinate frequency usage with adjacent licensees and permittees to avoid interference between adjacent systems. In addition, the height and power of transmitting facilities and the type of signals emitted must fall within specified parameters. For certain licensed services, a variety of incumbent government and non &#8209;government operations may have to be relocated before a licensee may commence operations, which may trigger the payment of relocation costs by the incoming licensee. 

The radio systems towers that we own and lease are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations that govern the location, marking, lighting, and construction of towers and are subject to the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and other environmental statutes enforced by the FCC. The FCC has also adopted guidelines and methods for evaluating human exposure to radio frequency emissions from radio equipment. We believe that all of our radio systems on towers that we own or lease comply in all material respects with these requirements, guidelines, and methods. 

The FCC has adopted requirements for cellular, PCS and other CMRS providers to implement basic and enhanced 911, or E &#8209;911, services. These services provide state and local emergency service providers with the ability to better identify and locate 911 callers using wireless services, including callers using special devices for the hearing impaired. Because the implementation of these obligations requires that the local emergency services provider have certain facilities available, our specific obligations are set on a market &#8209;by &#8209; market basis as emergency service providers request the implementation of E &#8209; 911 services within their locales. As part of its E &#8209;911 initiatives, the FCC recently 

&#160;

adopted stronger rules regarding E &#8209;911 location accuracy. The extent to which we are required to deploy E &#8209;911 services will affect our capital spending obligations. Federal law limits our liability for uncompleted 911 calls to a degree commensurate with wireline carriers in our markets. 

In 2013, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless carriers, such as ourselves, and certain other text messaging service providers to send an automatic &#8216;bounce &#8209;back&#8217; text message to consumers who try to text 911 where text &#8209;to &#8209;911 is not available, indicating the unavailability of such services. In August 2014, the FCC required all wireless carriers, such as ourselves, as well as other providers of interconnected text messaging applications, to be capable of supporting text &#8209;to &#8209;911 service by December 31, 2014, and to provide such service to requesting PSAPs by June 30, 2015 or six months after a request from a PSAP, whichever is later. The FCC has also sought further comment regarding additional regulations pertaining to the provision of text &#8209;to &#8209;911 service. 

Under certain circumstances, federal law also requires telecommunications carriers to provide law enforcement agencies with capacity and technical capabilities to support lawful wiretaps pursuant to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (or &#8220;CALEA&#8221;). Federal law also requires compliance with wiretap &#8209;related record &#8209;keeping and personnel &#8209;related obligations. We are in compliance with all such requirements currently applicable to us. The FCC has adopted rules that apply CALEA obligations to high speed Internet access and voice &#8209;over Internet protocol (or &#8220;VoIP&#8221;) services. Maintaining compliance with these law enforcement requirements may impose additional capital spending obligations on us to make necessary system upgrades. 

The FCC has long required CMRS providers to permit customers of other carriers to roam &#8220;manually&#8221; on their networks, for example, by supplying a credit card number, provided that the roaming customer&#8217;s handset is technically capable of accessing the roamed &#8209;on network. The FCC has also ruled that automatic voice roaming is a common carrier obligation for CMRS carriers. This ruling requires CMRS carriers to provide automatic voice roaming services to other CMRS carriers upon reasonable request and on a just, reasonable, and non &#8209;discriminatory basis pursuant to Sections 201 and 202 of the Communications Act. This automatic voice roaming obligation extends to services such as ours that are real &#8209;time, two &#8209;way switched voice or data services that are interconnected with the public switched network and utilize an in &#8209; network switching facility that enables the provider to reuse frequencies and accomplish seamless hand &#8209;off of subscriber calls. The FCC has held that the automatic voice roaming obligations of broadband CMRS providers extend to both in &#8209;market and out &#8209;of &#8209;market automatic voice roaming provided that the request is reasonable. In assessing whether a particular roaming request is reasonable, the FCC will consider the totality of the circumstances and may consider a number of factors, including the technical compatibility of the roamer, the extent of the requesting carrier&#8217;s build &#8209;out where it holds spectrum, and whether alternative roaming partners are available. In 2011, the FCC found that the automatic roaming obligation should be extended to services that are classified as information services (such as high speed wireless Internet access services) or to services that are not CMRS. The FCC found that such automatic data roaming, while not a common carrier service, should be offered by the providers of such services on a commercially reasonable basis, when technologically compatible and technologically feasible. The FCC may use a number of factors to determine commercial reasonableness of a particular request for such automatic data roaming services, including the technical compatibility of the roamer, the extent of the requesting carrier&#8217;s build &#8209;out where it holds spectrum, and whether alternative roaming partners are available. 

We are obligated to pay certain annual regulatory fees and assessments to support FCC wireless industry regulation, as well as fees supporting federal universal service programs, number portability, regional database costs, centralized telephone numbering administration, telecommunications relay service for the hearing &#8209;impaired and application filing fees. These fees are subject to change periodically by the FCC and the manner in which carriers may recoup these fees from customers is subject to various restrictions. 

Wireless and Wireline Services 

Universal Service. In general, all telecommunications providers are obligated to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund (or &#8220;USF&#8221;), which is used to promote the availability of wireline and wireless telephone service to individuals and families qualifying for federal assistance, households located in rural and high &#8209;cost areas, and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers. Contributions to the federal USF are based on end user interstate telecommunications revenue and some states have similar programs that also require contribution. The FCC is 

&#160;

examining the way in which it collects carrier contributions to the USF, including a proposal to base collections on the number of telephone numbers or network connections in use by each carrier. We contribute to the USF as required by the rules throughout the U.S., and receive funds from the USF for providing service in rural areas of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The collection of USF fees and distribution of USF support is under continual review by state and federal legislative and regulatory bodies and we are subject to audit by the Universal Service Administration Corporation (or &#8220;USAC&#8221;). We believe we are substantially compliant with all FCC and state regulations related to the receipt and collection of universal service support. 

In November 2011, the FCC released an order reforming the USF program to phase out the current level of high &#8209;cost USF support for wireless carriers over a period of five years, beginning in 2012. The scheduled phase out, however, was suspended in 2013 as the FCC addresses a delay in implementing phase two of its Mobility Fund program. Although we cannot predict the impact of such changes on the amounts we pay or receive in USF funds, we believe the changes are likely to impact our USF funding negatively, and consequently, our efforts to build and maintain networks in certain rural markets and our ability to provide services currently offered to very low income consumers supported by USF funds. The FCC&#8217;s overhaul of the rules governing the distribution of USF currently are subject to various petitions before the United States Supreme Court and various petitions for reconsideration before the FCC. We cannot predict the likely timing or outcome of such petitions. As part of the USF reforms, the FCC created two new replacement funds, the Connect America Fund and the Mobility Fund, both of which allow for the use of USF funds for broadband services, in addition to voice services. The new funds are intended to provide targeted financial support to areas that are unserved or under &#8209;served by voice and broadband service providers and will be initiated during the phase out of USF support. 

During this five year phase &#8209;out period, the FCC began distributing funds through new mechanisms associated with the Connect America Fund and the Mobility Fund. In July 2012, the FCC initiated the application process for the Mobility Fund I program, a reverse auction for a one &#8209;time distribution of up to $300 million intended to stimulate third &#8209; and fourth &#8209;generation wireless coverage in unserved and under &#8209;served geographic areas. A number of our subsidiaries participated in the Mobility Fund I reverse auction on September 27, 2012 and bid successfully for approximately $21.7 million in one &#8209;time support to expand voice and broadband networks in certain geographic areas in order to offer either 3G or 4G coverage. As part of the receipt of these funds, we committed to comply with certain additional FCC construction and other requirements. 

Intercarrier Compensation. Under federal and state law, telecommunications providers are generally required to compensate one another for originating and terminating traffic for other carriers. Consistent with these provisions, we currently receive compensation from other carriers and also pay compensation to ot her carriers. In October 2011, the FCC, significantly revised its intercarrier compensation regime. Under the revised intercarrier compensation regime, where there is no pre &#8209;existing agreement between a CMRS carrier and a local exchange carrier (or &#8220;LEC&#8221;) for the exchange of local traffic, such traffic between CMRS providers and most LECs is to be compensated pursuant to a default bill &#8209;and &#8209;keep regime, in which each carrier agrees to terminate calls from the other at no charge. The FCC&#8217;s new intercarrier compensation regime also sets forth a transition schedule that will eventually result in the exchange of traffic between telecommunications carriers being exchanged on a bill &#8209;and &#8209;keep basis. The FCC&#8217;s new intercarrier compensation rules may affect the manner in which we are charged or compensated for the exchange of traffic. We cannot predict the impact of any changes to these requirements on the amounts that we pay or receive. The FCC&#8217;s overhaul of the rules governing intercarrier compensation currently are subject to various petitions before the United States Supreme Court and various petitions for reconsideration before the FCC. We cannot predict the likely timing or outcome of such petitions. 

Local Competition. The Communications Act encourages competition in local telecommunications markets by removing barriers to market entry and imposing on non &#8209;rural incumbent local exchange carriers (or &#8220;ILECs&#8221;), among other things, duties to do the following: 

&#183; 

negotiate interconnection agreements at any technically feasible point on just, reasonable, and non &#8209;discriminatory rates, terms, and conditions; 

&#183; 

provide access to certain unbundled network elements (or &#8220;UNEs&#8221;), such as local loops and interoffice transport, or combinations of UNEs at nondiscriminatory, cost &#8209;based rates in certain circumstances; 

&#160;

&#183; 

provide physical collocation, which allows competitive local exchange carriers (or &#8220;CLECs&#8221;) to install and maintain its network termination equipment in an ILEC&#8217;s central office or to obtain functionally equivalent forms of interconnection under certain circumstances; 

&#183; 

provide access to poles, ducts, conduits, and rights &#8209;of &#8209;way on a reasonable, non &#8209;discriminatory basis; 

&#183; 

offer retail local telephone services to resellers at discounted wholesale rates; 

&#183; 

when a call originates on its network, compensate other telephone companies for terminating or transporting the call; 

&#183; 

provide dialing parity, which ensures that customers are able to route their calls to telecommunications service providers without having to dial additional digits; 

&#183; 

provide notice of changes in information needed for another carrier to transmit and route services using its facilities; and 

&#183; 

provide telephone number portability, so customers may keep the same telephone number if they switch service providers. 

In addition, under Section 271 of the Communications Act, the Bell Operating Companies (or &#8220;BOCs&#8221;) have an obligation to provide certain network elements, including elements (for example, local switching) that have been removed from the mandatory list of network elements that must be unbundled under Section 251 of the Communications Act. The BOCs are required to provide Section 271 network elements under a &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; pricing standard. Over time, the FCC has removed the BOCs&#8217; obligation to provide certain network elements under Section 271. There can be no assurance that the FCC will not continue to exercise its authority to remove other Section 271 network element obligations in the future. Any such action by the FCC may have an adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of our U.S. Wireline segment. We operate in a region where the ILEC is required to comply with the above &#8209;mentioned statutory provisions, and, accordingly, we have benefited from the reduced costs in acquiring required communication services, such as ILEC interconnection, and have benefited from the right to receive compensation for the termination of traffic. Provisions relating to interconnection, telephone number portability, equal access, and resale could, however, subject us to increased competition and additional economic and regulatory burdens. The FCC recently initiated a proceeding to gather information regarding a potential future transition from TDM to IP. The FCC has explicitly stated that it will consider the regulatory obligations that would apply to any transition of services from TDM to IP at a later time. We cannot predict with any certainty the FCC&#8217;s approach regarding the application of particular regulations in an IP &#8209;based regime. 

While the FCC to date has declined to classify interconnected VoIP service as a telecommunications service or information service, it has imposed a number of consumer protection and public safety obligations on interconnected VoIP providers, relying in large part on its general ancillary jurisdiction powers. To the extent that we provide interconnected VoIP service we will be subject to a number of these obligations. 

The FCC, in March 2015, adopted net neutrality rules for broadband Internet providers, including mobile broadband Internet providers, in which such providers would not be able to engage in various forms of blocking, throttling or engaging in paid prioritization agreements with respect to Internet content, subject to reasonable network management. The FCC also adopted enhanced transparency rules and a general conduct rule regarding behavior of broadband Internet providers. In doing so, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet service as a Title II service under the Communications Act. The FCC, in reclassifying broadband Internet service as a Title II service did specifically forbear from applying many legacy common carrier regulations to broadband Internet service providers. These network neutrality rules have been appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and such appeal remains pending. We cannot predict with any certainty the likely timing or outcome of any Court action. &#160; 

&#160;

Obligations Due to Economic Stimulus Grants 

Three of our subsidiaries have received awards from the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (&#8220;BTOP&#8221;) of the U.S. Department of Commerce (&#8220;DOC&#8221;) pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (&#8220;ARRA&#8221;). As a BTOP awardee, we are subject to the various terms and conditions included in the agency&#8217;s Notice of Funds Availability published in the Federal Register on July 9, 2009. Among these requirements are Interconnection and Non &#8209; Discrimination requirements by which any awardee must comply with the following requirements: (i) adhere to the principles contained in the FCC&#8217;s Internet Policy Statement (FCC 05 &#8209;151, adopted August 5, 2005) or any subsequent ruling or statement; (ii) not favor any lawful Internet applications and content over others; (iii) display network management policies in a prominent location on its web page and provide notice to customers of changes to these policies; (iv) connect to the public Internet directly or indirectly, so that the project is not an entirely private closed network; and (v) offer interconnection, where technically feasible without exceeding current or reasonably anticipated capacity limitations, at reasonable rates and terms to be negotiated with requesting parties. While FCC rules regarding these issues may apply to all our operations, these particular requirements apply only to our BTOP &#8209;funded projects. 

As a BTOP awardee, we are also required to comply with other terms and conditions of the individual DOC grants, including reporting, transparency and audit requirements pursuant to Section 1512 of the ARRA, and notification and reporting obligations set forth in the Office of Management and Budget Memorandum, Implementing Guidance for Reports on Use of Funds Pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (OMB M &#8209;09 &#8209;21, June 22, 2009). We believe we are currently in material compliance with all BTOP and DOC requirements applicable to our grants. 

Renewable Energy Services 

All of our currently owned projects in operation are solar &#8220;qualifying facilities&#8221; under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (&#8220;PURPA&#8221;). As such, the projects and the respective project company that own the projects are exempt from ratemaking and certain other regulatory provisions of the Federal Power Act, as amended (&#8220;FPA&#8221;), and from state organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities. 

Our projects are also subject to compliance with the applicable mandatory reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and approved by FERC under the FPA. 

Additionally, certain of the project companies that own projects or the &#8220;offtakers&#8221; of the electricity from the projects have entered into interconnection agreements with the local utility that allows the project companies or the offtakers to deliver excess electricity to the utility distribution system. In almost all cases, interconnection agreements are standard form agreements that have been preapproved by the local public utility commission or other state regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over interconnection agreements. 

U.S. State Regulation (Telecommunications) 

Federal law preempts state and local regulation of the entry of, or the rates charged by, any CMRS provider. As a practical matter, we are free to establish rates and offer new products and service with a minimum of regulatory requirements. The states in which we operate maintain nominal oversight jurisdiction. For example, although states do not have the authority to regulate the entry or the rates charged by CMRS providers, states may regulate the &#8220;other terms and conditions&#8221; of a CMRS provider&#8217;s service. Most states still maintain some form of jurisdiction over complaints as to the nature or quality of services and as to billing issues. Since states may continue to regulate &#8220;other terms and conditions&#8221; of wireless service, and a number of state authorities have initiated actions or investigations of various wireless carrier practices, the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain and could require us to change certain of our practices and ultimately increase state regulatory authority over the wireless industry. States and localities assess on wireless carriers taxes and fees that may equal or even exceed federal obligations. 

The location and construction of our wireless transmitter towers and antennas are subject to state and local environmental regulation, as well as state or local zoning, land use and other regulation. Before we can put a system into 

&#160;

commercial operation, we must obtain all necessary zoning and building permit approvals for the cell site and tower locations. The time needed to obtain zoning approvals and requisite state permits varies from market to market and state to state. Likewise, variations exist in local zoning processes. If zoning approval or requisite state permits cannot be obtained, or if environmental rules make construction impossible or infeasible on a particular site, our network design might be adversely affected, network design costs could increase and the service provided to our customers might be reduced. 

The FCC has adopted a declaratory ruling establishing presumptive timeframes in which states and localities must resolve tower siting applications before the applicant may seek judicial review&#8212;90 days for collocations and 150 days for all other siting applications. This ruling will expedite our ability to seek legal redress, and thus mitigate tower construction delays, in the event a state or locality does not timely act on our zoning applications. 

Guyana Regulatio n 

Our subsidiary, Guyana Telephone &#38; Telegraph Limited (&#8220;GT&#38;T&#8221;), in which we hold an 80% interest, is subject to regulation in Guyana under the provisions of GT&#38;T&#8217;s License from the Government of Guyana, the Guyana Public Utilities Commission Act of 1999 as amended (or &#8220;PUC Law&#8221;) and the Guyana Telecommunications Act 1990 (or &#8220;Telecommunications Law&#8221;). The Public Utilities Commission of Guyana (or &#8220;PUC&#8221;) is an independent statutory body with the principal responsibility for regulating telecommunications rates and services in Guyana. The Ministry of Telecommunications, an agency of the Government of Guyana, has formal authority over telecommunications licensing and related issues. 

Licenses. GT&#38;T provides domestic fixed (both wireline and wireless) and international voice and data services in Guyana pursuant to a License from the Government of Guyana granting GT&#38;T the exclusive right to provide the following: public telephone, radio telephone, and pay telephone services; domestic fixed services (both wireline and wireless); international voice and data services; sale of advertising in any telephone directories; and switched or non &#8209; switched private line service. The License, which was issued in December 1990, had an initial 20 &#8209;year term. Pursuant to the License, GT&#38;T also provides mobile wireless telephone service in Guyana on a non &#8209;exclusive basis pursuant to an initial twenty &#8209;year term. In November 2009, GT&#38;T notified the Government of its election to renew both the exclusive and non &#8209; exclusive license grants for an additional 20 year term expiring in 2030. In exercising this option, GT&#38;T reiterated to the Government that GT&#38;T and the Company would be willing to voluntarily relinquish the exclusivity aspect of GT&#38;T&#8217;s licenses, but only as part of an alternative agreement with the Government. On December 15, 2010, the Government, through the Office of the President, sent a letter to GT&#38;T indicating that GT&#38;T&#8217;s License was renewed until such time as a new legislative and regulatory regime to reform the telecommunications sector in Guyana is brought into force; however, GT&#38;T formally notified the Government that it is entitled to an unconditional renewal of both the exclusive and non &#8209;exclusive license grants for an additional period of twenty years or until such time as GT&#38;T and the Company enter into an alternative agreement with the Government. 

PUC Law and Telecommunications Law. The PUC Law and the Telecommunications Law provide the general framework for the regulation of telecommunications services in Guyana. As a general matter, the PUC has authority to regulate GT&#38;T&#8217;s domestic and international telecommunications services and rates and to require GT&#38;T to supply certain technical, administrative and financial information as it may request. The PUC claims broad authority to review and amend any of GT&#38;T&#8217;s programs for development and expansion of facilities or services, although GT&#38;T has challenged the PUC&#8217;s view on the scope of its authority. For a description of recent actions of the PUC, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 

Regulatory Developments. Since 2001, the Government of Guyana has stated its intention to introduce additional competition into Guyana&#8217;s telecommunications sector. Since that time, we have met on many occasions with officials of the Government of Guyana to discuss potential modifications of our exclusivity and other rights under the existing agreement. In 2012, the Government of Guyana introduced a bill into Parliament containing draft legislation, regulations, and licenses that, if enacted, would have the effect of terminating our exclusive license by permitting other telecommunications carriers to receive licenses to provide domestic fixed services and international voice and data services in Guyana. This proposed legislation would also introduce material changes to many other features of Guyana&#8217;s existing telecommunications regulatory regime. While no action has been taken on the proposed legislation since 2012, 

&#160;

we cannot predict when or if the proposed legislation will be adopted by Parliament or, if adopted and then signed into law by the President, the manner in which it would be implemented by the Minister of Telecommunications and the PUC. Although we believe that we would be entitled to damages or other compensation for any involuntary termination of our contractual exclusivity rights, we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in a proceeding to enforce our rights or that such actions would effectively halt any unilateral action by the Government. 

FCC Rule &#8209;Making and International Long &#8209;Distance Rates. The actions of foreign telecommunications regulators, especially the FCC in the United States, can affect the settlement or termination rate payable by foreign carriers to GT&#38;T for incoming international voice calls. While the FCC continues to monitor and evaluate termination rate levels and benchmarks, the Company cannot predict when and if the FCC will further reduce settlement rates or the effect lower rates will have on revenue in the Company&#8217;s International Integrated Telephony segment. 

Caribbean and Bermuda Regulation 

In Bermuda, we were historically subject to Bermuda&#8217;s Telecommunications Act of 1986 that authorized it to use spectrum to deliver services under its &#8220;Class B&#8221; license. Beginning in 2013, the Regulatory Authority continued its implementation of the Electronic Communications Act of 2011, which allows communications service providers to enter new lines of business and introduces competition in the sector. As the government of Bermuda reforms the local telecommunications market, it has imposed regulatory and other fees and adopted additional regulation that have increased the regulatory costs incurred by and could otherwise impact the Company&#8217;s Bermuda operations. For instance, in December 2014, the Bermuda Regulatory Authority adopted a decision imposing a limitation on amounts of spectrum that may be held by a single carrier and requiring the Company to surrender a portion of existing spectrum held in Bermuda that the Company had reserved for the launch of next generation services in accordance with the Company&#8217;s plans and demands of its customers. The Company initiated legal proceedings challenging the implementation of such decision, however, was not successful in staying the decision and in March 2015 surrendered the spectrum in question to the Bermuda Regulatory Authority. The Company has withdrawn its appeal of the decision without prejudice and cannot now accurately predict the impact to the competitive position of the Company&#8217;s Bermuda business or limitations that such actions will have on the Company&#8217;s ability to grow. 

&#160; 

The term of the Company&#8217;s telecommunications license to operate in Aruba expired on January 15, 2014. The government of Aruba informed the Company earlier in January 2014 that a renewed license would be issued only upon payment by the Company of a fee in the amount of Afl &#160; 7.2 million (or approximately &#160; US$4 million). The Company is continuing to operate as it is actively contesting the assessment of such fee.
