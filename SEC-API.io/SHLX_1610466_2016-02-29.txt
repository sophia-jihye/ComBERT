 Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

Overview 

Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. is a Delaware limited partnership formed by Shell on March 19, 2014, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets. On November 3, 2014, we completed our IPO. Our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;SHLX.&#8221; As of December 31, 2015, SPLC, through Shell Midstream LP Holdings LLC, owned 21,475,068 common units and 67,475,068 subordinated units, representing a 57.4% limited partner interest in us. SPLC also owned a 100.0% interest in Shell Midstream Partners GP LLC, our general partner, which in turn owned 3,098,825 general partner units, representing a 2.0% general partner interest in us.

We are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership. Our assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil and refined products pipelines and a crude tank storage and terminal system. Our pipelines and crude tank storage and terminal system serve as key infrastructure to transport and store onshore and offshore crude oil production to Gulf Coast and Midwest refining markets and to deliver refined products from Gulf Coast markets to major demand centers. We generate the majority of our revenue under long-term agreements by charging fees for the transportation or storage of crude oil and refined products through our pipelines and crude tank storage and terminal system. We do not engage in the marketing and trading of any commodities. Our operations comprise one reportable segment containing our portfolio of pipelines and other midstream assets. See Note 1&#8212;Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

As part of our IPO, we acquired a 43.0% interest in Zydeco Pipeline Company LLC (&#8220;Zydeco&#8221;), a 28.6% interest in Mars Oil Pipeline Company (&#8220;Mars&#8221;), a 49% interest in Bengal Pipeline Company LLC (&#8220;Bengal&#8221;) and a 1.612% interest in Colonial Pipeline Company (&#8220;Colonial&#8221;). 

In 2015, we completed three additional acquisitions from Shell with an aggregate purchase price of $1,188.0 million. These acquisitions are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 

On May 18, 2015, we acquired an additional 19.5% interest in Zydeco and an additional 1.388% interest in Colonial from SPLC for $448.0 million in cash. This transaction was effective as of April 1, 2015. 

&#160;

&#183; 

On July 1, 2015, we acquired a 36.0% interest in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, LLC (&#8220;Poseidon&#8221;) from Equilon Enterprises LLC, d/b/a Shell Oil Products US (&#8220;SOPUS&#8221;), for $350.0 million in cash. 

&#160;

&#183; 

On November 17, 2015, we acquired a 100.0% interest in Pecten Midstream LLC (&#8220;Pecten&#8221;), which owns the Auger Pipeline System (&#8220;Auger&#8221;) and the Lockport Terminal (&#8220;Lockport&#8221;)(collectively, the &#8220;Shell Auger and Lockport Operations&#8221;), from SPLC for $390.0 million in cash. This transaction was effective as of October 1, 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned a 62.5% int erest in Zydeco, a 28.6% interest in Mars, a 49.0% interest in Bengal, a 3.0% interest in Colonial, a 36.0% interest in Poseidon and a 100.0% interest in Pecten. See our organizational structure presented by the diagram on the following page. 

We own interests in four crude oil pipeline systems, two refined products systems and a crude tank storage and terminal system. The crude oil pipeline systems, which are held by Zydeco, Mars, Poseidon and Pecten, are strategically located along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. These systems link major onshore and offshore production areas with key refining markets. The refined products pipeline systems, which are held by Bengal and Colonial, connect Gulf Coast and southeastern U.S. refineries to major demand centers from Alabama to New York. The crude tank storage and terminal system, Lockport, is located southwest of Chicago and receives Canadian crude from the Enbridge pipeline and serves as a distribution point for movements originating on the Mustang and Westshore pipeline systems.

Organizational Structure 

&#160;

Note: Pecten holds 100.0% of the Shell Auger and Lockport Operations. 

Business Strategies 

Our primary business objectives are to generate stable and predictable cash flows and increase our quarterly cash distribution per unit over time through safe and reliable operation of our assets and by pursuing strategic acquisitions from Shell and third parties. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Maintain Safe and Reliable Operations. We are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations, which we believe to be key components in generating stable cash flows. We strive for operational excellence by using SPLC&#8217;s existing programs to integrate health, occupational safety, process safety and environmental principles throughout our business with a commitment to continuous improvement. In addition, many of our assets are relatively new or have recently undergone significant upgrades. SPLC&#8217;s employees operate Zydeco&#8217;s Ho-Ho pipeline and Mars. Colonial operates its pipeline system. Colonial is the system operator of Bengal for regulatory reporting purposes and operates Bengal&#8217;s tankage while SPLC operates Bengal&#8217;s pipelines. SPLC and Colonial are industry-leading pipeline operators that have been recognized for safety and reliability. We and all of our operators invest in the maintenance and integrity of our assets, both directly or through our joint venture entities. We employ SPLC&#8217;s rigorous training, integrity and audit programs to drive continuous improvements in safety as we strive for zero incidents. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Focus on Fee-Based Businesses. We are focused on generating stable and predictable cash flows by providing fee-based transportation and storage services, most of which are underpinned by ship-or-pay contracts or life-of-lease agreements, some of which provide us with a guaranteed return. We intend to continue to focus on assets that generate revenue from multiple long-term, fee-based agreements with inflation escalators. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Grow Our Business Through Strategic Acquisitions. We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions of assets from Shell and third parties. In 2015, we completed three acquisitions from Shell, adding additional pipeline assets to our portfolio and diversifying our portfolio with storage assets. We believe Shell will offer us opportunities to acquire additional interests in our assets, as well as additional midstream assets that it currently owns or may acquire or develop in the future. We also may have opportunities to pursue the acquisition or development of additional assets jointly with Shell. However, Shell is under no obligation to offer any assets or opportunities to us. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Optimize Existing Assets and Pursue Organic Growth Opportunities. We will seek to enhance the profitability of our businesses by pursuing opportunities to increase throughput volumes, manage costs and improve operating efficiencies. We also will consider opportunities to increase revenue on our pipeline systems by evaluating and capitalizing on organic expansion projects, including, for example, connecting additional production or refineries, or increasing pipeline capacity by adding pumps. The reversal of Zydeco&#8217;s Ho-Ho pipeline in 2013, the expansion of Zydeco in 2014 and 2015, the expansion of Mars in 2014 and Poseidon&#8217;s recent upgrade to South Marsh Island 205 demonstrate our ability to respond to demand for transportation services in the areas in which we operate. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we are well positioned to execute our business strategies based on the following competitive strengths: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our Relationship with Shell. We believe that our relationship with Shell provides us with a strategic advantage to operate and compete for additional midstream assets. SPLC owns our general partner, a significant limited partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights. In addition, Shell owns a substantial amount of other midstream assets, including additional interests in our assets. We believe that our relationship with Shell will provide us with significant growth opportunities. We also expect that we will benefit from SPLC&#8217;s long history of operating safe and reliable pipelines. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Strategically Located Assets. Our assets serve as key infrastructure to transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to Gulf Coast and Midwest refining markets and to deliver refined products from Gulf Coast markets to major demand centers. Our crude oil pipeline systems are strategically located along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and offshore Louisiana and link major onshore and offshore areas of current and future production with key refining markets. Our storage and terminal facility at Lockport serves Midwest refiners and pipelines. Our refined products pipelines connect Gulf Coast and southeastern U.S. refining areas to major demand centers from Alabama to New York. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. Our assets primarily consist of interests in common carrier pipeline systems that generate stable revenue under FERC-based tariffs and long-term transportation agreements. Our ship-or-pay contracts substantially mitigate volatility in our cash flows by limiting our exposure to changing market dynamics that can reduce production and affect shipper demand for the life of the contract. Our life-of-lease agreements, some of which have a guaranteed return, reduce our cash flow exposure to volume reductions. We also believe that our strong position as the outlet for major offshore production with consistent production activity will provide consistent revenue. In addition, our storage assets provide steady payments over the long-term life of the contract without regard to commodity prices or the amount of product stored as we are paid for tank availability in addition to throughput. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Financial Flexibility. We have revolving credit facilities with an affiliate of Shell with an aggregate $610.0 million in total capacity, with an availability of $151.8 million, as of December 31, 2015. We believe that we will have the financial flexibility to execute our growth strategy through borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities and access to capital markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Experienced Management Team. Our management team has subst antial experience in the management and operation of pipelines, storage facilities and other midstream assets. Our management team also has expertise in executing growth strategies in the midstream sector and includes many of SPLC&#8217;s and Shell&#8217;s senior mana gement, who average over 20 years of experience in the energy industry. 

Execution of our strategies and leverage of our strengths are subject to risks and uncertainties. We may not be successful in executing our strategies. See Risks Related to Our Business in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.

Our Assets and Operations 

Our assets consist of the following systems: 

&#160;

(1) We do not own these pipelines that connect to our Lockport terminal. 

Zydeco System 

General . Zydeco was formed by SPLC in January 2014 to own what was then called the Ho-Ho Pipeline (now called Zydeco, the Zydeco Pipeline or the Zydeco pipeline system). Zydeco&#8217;s assets are situated within the largest refining market in the United States. Following the flow reversal project completed in December 2013, the Zydeco pipeline system provides a critical outlet to alleviate current transportation bottlenecks for crude oil produced in multiple basins throughout North America, a large portion of which is transported to and stored in the Houston area, to access major refining centers along the Gulf Coast. 

Zydeco spans over 350 miles and currently has a mainline capacity of approximately 375 kbpd. Zydeco consists of four main segments: (i) the Houston, Texas to Port Neches, Texas segment, which has a capacity of 250 kbpd, (ii) the Port Neches, Texas to Houma, Louisiana segment which has a capacity of 360 kbpd, (iii) the Houma, Louisiana to Clovelly, Louisiana segment, which has a capacity of 400 kbpd, and (iv) the Houma, Louisiana to St. James, Louisiana segment, which has a capacity of 260 kbpd. The capacity 

increases facilitate additional crude oil volumes coming into Zydeco at those locations. Zydeco also includes tankage in Port Neches, Texas and Erath and Houma, Louisiana, a dock in Houma, Louisiana and a 16-inch pipeline that indirectly connects to the offshore Boxer pipeline system. 

Ownership and Operatorship. Zydeco wholly owns the Zydeco pipeline system and we own a 62.5% interest in Zydeco. SPLC owns the remaining 37.5% interest in Zydeco. SPLC&#8217;s employees operate Zydeco. 

Customers. Zydeco&#8217;s customers include traders, marketers, refiners and producers. An affiliate of Shell is a customer of Zydeco. For 2015 and 2014, four third-party customers accounted for 75.0% and 66.0%, respectively, of total Zydeco revenue. 

Contracts . Zydeco is supported by FERC-approved transportation services agreements and spot volumes. When the Zydeco expansion projects described below are completed, 86.9% of Zydeco&#8217;s fully-expanded mainline capacity will be subject to FERC-approved transportation services agreements with a weighted average remaining term of approximately seven years. The FERC limits contracting to 90% of capacity in order to preserve space for spot volumes, and we believe that Zydeco is well positioned to capture spot volumes with over 60 approved shippers, over 15 delivery points serving major Gulf Coast refineries and access to storage facilities. 

Shipping Rates. Zydeco is regulated by the FERC, with shipping rates that may be adjusted annually in accordance with the FERC index. Such regulation allows for annual cash flow increases without commensurate incremental capital expenditures. Contract transportation tariffs range from $1.05/bbl to $2.17/bbl depending on the origin and destination selected for the contract, level of service and contract duration. Published tariff rates on Zydeco are available on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission website. 

Reversal and Expansion of Zydeco. Demand for new crude oil production in North America has created opportunities for Zydeco. A flow reversal of the Zydeco pipeline system was completed in December 2013. Zydeco now runs from Houston, Texas to market hubs in St. James and Clovelly, Louisiana and transports light crude oil volumes arriving in the Houston market from the Eagle Ford shale, the Permian Basin and the Bakken shale to Gulf Coast refining centers. We completed expansion projects on Zydeco, including the installation of new pump stations and the addition of a new connection at Nederland in 2014. We added new tankage at Port Neches and expect to add a new third-party connection before the end of 2016. 

Mars System 

General. The Mars pipeline system is a major corridor pipeline servicing a high-growth area of the Gulf of Mexico, originating approximately 95 miles offshore in the deepwater Mississippi Canyon and terminating in salt dome caverns in Clovelly, Louisiana. Mars was initially constructed in 1995, and in 2014 underwent a major expansion. The Mars pipeline system is approximately 163 miles in length and has 16-, 18- and 24-inch diameter lines with mainline capacity of up to 600 kbpd. Mars delivers production received from the Mississippi Canyon area, including the Olympus and Mars A platform and the Medusa and Ursa pipelines, and from the Green Canyon and Walker Ridge areas via the Amberjack pipeline connection, to shore. Due to Mars&#8217; existing connections to the Amberjack pipeline, Mars has benefitted from Amberjack&#8217;s recent connections to the Jack/St. Malo, Coelacanth and Powerball fields and future connection to the Big Foot and Stampede fields. Mars is expected to be an increasingly important conduit for crude oil produced in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to access salt dome caverns in Clovelly, Louisiana, which is a major trading hub. Mars leases its main storage cavern at Clovelly from LOOP LLC, an affiliate of Shell. The cavern lease has been renewed through 2021 and will renew automatically in five-year terms thereafter through 2031, subject to Mars&#8217; right to terminate one year before lease renewal. LOOP LLC may also cancel the lease under certain extraordinary circumstances including the revocation of a governmental license to operate the cavern. 

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 28.6% interest and SPLC owns a 42.9% ownership interest in Mars. An affiliate of BP p.l.c. (&#8220;BP&#8221;) owns the remaining 28.5% interest in Mars. SPLC operates the Mars pipeline. 

Customers. Mars has maintained a set of well-established customers, including an affiliate of Shell. Mars is connected to production platforms and the Ursa and Medusa pipeline systems tie in to Mars, bringing the production from additional production platforms dedicated to these two pipelines into Mars. Mars also receives significant volume from Amberjack at Fourchon, Louisiana, the terminus of the Amberjack pipeline system. 

Contracts. For 2015 and 2014, 57.0% and 68.6%, respectively, of volumes transported on Mars were moved either under life-of-lease agreements or posted tariffs from production areas where there was established and consistent production activity and where there was limited take-away capacity beyond what our pipelines offered. Mars tariffs are subject to annual adjustment based on the FERC index. Such tariff adjustments allow for annual cash flow increases without commensurate incremental capital expenditures. In addition, in connection with the expansion described below, Mars entered into life-of-lease transportation agreements with certain producers that include a guaranteed return for Mars for an initial period of time and thereafter will continue for the life of the lease. Mars also moves significant volumes from its connection with the Amberjack pipeline. This connection is governed by a FERC tariff, 

and we expect Mars&#8217; share of the volumes moving under the connecting tariff to grow as production from the new Jack/St. Malo and other fields, connecting to the Amberjack pipeline, increases. 

Mars Expansion . Mars completed an expansion project that became operational in February 2014. The expansion added approximately 41 miles of 16- to 18-inch diameter pipeline that connects the new Olympus platform to Mars&#8217; existing pipeline at the West Delta 143 platform. The Olympus platform, which is the largest tension-leg platform in the Gulf of Mexico, accesses the deepwater South Deimos, West Boreas and Mars fields. 

Bengal System 

General. We own a 49.0% interest and SPLC directly owns a 1.0% interest in Bengal, a joint venture formed by Colonial and SPLC in 2006. Bengal owns a refined products pipeline system connecting four refineries in southern Louisiana to long-haul transportation pipelines. The 158-mile Bengal pipeline system consists of two primary pipelines: 

&#160;

&#183; 

A 24-inch diameter pipeline with a 305 kbpd capacity that connects the Motiva and Valero refineries in Norco, Louisiana and the Marathon refinery in Garyville, Louisiana to Bengal&#8217;s Baton Rouge, Louisiana tankage and the Plantation pipeline. The Plantation pipeline originates in Louisiana and ends in the Washington, D.C. area, and serves various metropolitan areas along the way, including Birmingham, Alabama, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina and the Washington, D.C. area. 

&#160;

&#183; 

A 16-inch diameter pipeline with a 210 kbpd capacity that runs from Motiva&#8217;s Convent, Louisiana refinery to the Plantation pipeline and Bengal&#8217;s Baton Rouge, Louisiana tankage. 

Bengal&#8217;s approximately four million barrels of tankage in Baton Rouge connects to the Colonial pipeline and gives customers access to markets in the southeastern and eastern United States. 

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 49.0% interest in Bengal, SPLC owns a 1.0% ownership interest in Bengal and Colonial owns a 50.0% interest in Bengal. Colonial is the system operator for regulatory reporting purposes and operates Bengal&#8217;s tankage. SPLC operates Bengal&#8217;s pipelines. 

Customers. The Bengal pipeline system provides transportation for a number of customers from connected refineries and terminals to the Plantation and Colonial pipelines, and from refineries to the Baton Rouge tankage. 

Contracts . Bengal&#8217;s revenue is primarily dependent on ship-or-pay contracts. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 67.0% of Bengal&#8217;s capacity was subject to minimum volume commitments under ship-or-pay contracts. These contracts are renewable at the election of the shipper. For the ship-or-pay contracts, one of three contracts was recently re-committed to Bengal with a five-year extension, representing approximately 58.0% of total volumes. Rates for Bengal&#8217;s transportation services are governed by Bengal&#8217;s FERC-approved tariffs. These tariffs are subject to annual adjustment based on the FERC index. 

Bengal also has a joint tariff division agreement with Colonial covering transportation of refined products from refineries connected to the Bengal pipeline system to destinations in the southeast and eastern United States via the Colonial pipeline system. Under this joint tariff, Colonial bills and collects the tariff from the product shippers and remits to Bengal its share of the joint tariff. 

Poseidon System 

General. The Poseidon pipeline system is a 367-mile Gulf of Mexico offshore crude oil pipeline with a 350 kbpd capacity transporting to key markets in Texas and Louisiana. A key corridor pipeline, Poseidon connects to approximately 50 Gulf of Mexico fields and delivers to three locations. It provides access to major crude trading hubs via connecting carriers (i.e., Gibson/Houma to St James and Clovelly, Louisiana and via Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System to Texas hubs in Texas City and Port Arthur). Poseidon delivers crude oil at the following locations: 

&#160;

(a) 

into Zydeco&#8217;s tankage at Houma, Louisiana via Poseidon&#8217;s 24-inch line from Ship Shoal 332A&#894; 

&#160;

(b) 

into connecting carriers at St. James, Louisiana via Zydeco&#8217;s 18-inch line from Houma, Louisiana&#894; and 

&#160;

(c) 

for barrels on the west side of the Poseidon system and for certain barrels at Ship Shoal 332A, Poseidon can deliver oil into Auger via South Marsh Island 205A in addition to receiving oil from Auger, if needed. 

Poseidon has ownership of the strategic platform South Marsh Island 205A. Poseidon is expected to enjoy growth prospects driven by new Gulf of Mexico fields in proximity to the pipeline.

Ownership and Operatorship. Poseidon is currently owned 64.0% by the operator, and 36.0% by us. 

Customers. Poseidon&#8217;s largest customers are major oil producers who ship from a variety of production fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Ea ch accounts for material throughput on the system, and together these shippers account for 90.0% of the throughput. 

Contracts. Poseidon earns income through buy/sell arrangements, pursuant to which it purchases crude oil from its customer at the time the crude oil enters its pipeline system, and then resells the crude oil to the customer at the time the crude oil reaches its destination. At the resell point, Poseidon receives the original purchase price plus an agreed differential (referred to as the buy/sell differential). Many of Poseidon&#8217;s customers have dedicated production to the pipeline. Some of Poseidon&#8217;s customers have agreed to pay for the transportation of minimum periodic volumes whether or not they actually deliver those volumes for transportation. 

Colonial System 

General. Colonial is the largest refined products pipeline in the United States based on barrel-miles transported. Colonial includes more than 5,500 miles of pipeline connecting refineries along the Gulf Coast to approximately 265 marketing terminals between Houston, Texas and Linden, New Jersey. Colonial transports more than 100.0 million gallons a day of gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, home heating oil, diesel fuel and national defense fuels to shipper terminals in 13 states and the District of Columbia. 

Ownership and Operatorship. We own a 3.0% interest and SPLC owns a 13.12% interest in Colonial. CDPQ Colonial Partners, LP; Koch Capital Investments Company, LLC; KKR-Keats Pipeline Investors LP and IFM (US) Colonial Pipeline 2, LLC collectively own the remaining 83.88% interest in Colonial. Colonial operates its pipeline system and has its own management team based in Alpharetta, Georgia. 

Customers. Since its inception in 1963, Colonial has served a diverse set of customers, including refiners, marketers, airports and airlines. In 2015, more than 100 shippers transported product through Colonial&#8217;s system, including an affiliate of Shell. 

Contracts. Colonial is subject to FERC regulation, with both market-based rates and rates that are subject to annual adjustment based on the FERC index. 

Auger System

General. Auger is a 174-mile offshore Gulf of Mexico corridor pipeline that transports medium sour crude from producers in eastern Garden Bank and Keathley Canyon blocks. Auger is located near the Lower Tertiary region of the Gulf of Mexico, a developing high growth region. Auger offers two crude market options: (i) the 20-inch delivers to Ship Shoal pipeline at SS 28 for delivery to the St James market hub (Bonito Sour crude), and (ii) the 12-inch delivers to Eugene Island pipeline for delivery to the Houma market hub (Eugene Island crude). Auger shares a complementary strategic connection to the Poseidon pipeline system through South Marsh Island 205 which provides the producers connected to Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline Company L.L.C. (&#8220;SEKCo&#8221;) the option of either Poseidon or Auger delivery markets. 

Ownership and Operatorship. Pecten wholly owns the Auger crude pipeline system and we own a 100.0% interest in Pecten. SPLC&#8217;s employees operate Auger. 

Customers. Auger provides transportation for major oil producers and from more than 13 different production fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Auger has several direct connected producers, including the Shell operated Garden Banks 426 (Auger) and Garden Banks 128 (Enchilada) platforms, and the ConocoPhillips operated Garden Banks 783 platform, connected via the Magnolia lateral pipeline. Auger also receives production from producers connected to Poseidon and SEKCo, including the Anadarko operated KC 875 platform (Lucius), via the South Marsh Island 205 Poseidon pipeline connection. The Auger pipeline system provides transportation for a number of customers from offshore to St. James via Ship Shoal and Houma via Eugene Island. 

Contracts . Auger receives the majority of its revenues from volumes transported on posted transportation rates, some of which are indexed annually. For direct connected producers, including Garden Banks 426 and Garden Banks 128 platforms, Auger captures transportation revenue for 100.0% of those volumes. Auger also receives transportation revenue from receipts at the South Marsh Island 205 connection, as producers seek to deliver into the typically advantaged Bonito Sour market at St. James. 

Lockport Terminal 

General. Lockport is a crude terminal facility located southwest of Chicago with 2 million barrels of storage capacity that feeds regional refineries, while also offering strategic trading opportunities. Lockport receives Canadian crude from the Enbridge pipeline and serves as a distribution point for movements originating on the Mustang and Westshore pipeline systems. 

Ownership and Operatorship. Pecten wholly owns the Lockport crude tank storage and terminal system and we own a 100.0% interest in Pecten. SPLC&#8217;s employees operate Lockport. 

Customers. The Lockport crude tank storage and terminal system provides storage serv ices for a number of customers, receives primarily Canadian and Midwest crude and supplies Midwest refineries, such as Citgo Lamont Refinery and via connection to Patoka, a regional distribution hub. 

Contracts . Lockport receives its revenues from contracted storage capacity. Lockport has a strong customer base with a track record of more than 20 years, and 100.0% of the leased capacity is being utilized by our customers.

Our Relationship with Shell 

Shell is one of the world&#8217;s largest independent energy companies in terms of market capitalization and operating cash flow, and Shell and its joint ventures are a leading producer and transporter of onshore and offshore hydrocarbons as well as a major refiner in the United States. As one of the largest producers in the Gulf of Mexico, Shell is currently developing several deepwater prospects and associated infrastructure. In addition to its offshore production, Shell has significant onshore exploration and production interests and produces crude oil and natural gas throughout North America. Shell&#8217;s downstream portfolio includes interests in refineries throughout the United States. Shell&#8217;s portfolio of midstream assets provides key infrastructure required to transport and store crude oil and refined products for Shell and third parties. Shell&#8217;s ownership interests in transportation and midstream assets include crude oil and refined products pipelines, crude oil and refined products terminals, chemicals pipelines, natural gas processing plants, and LNG infrastructure assets. Shell or its affiliates are customers of all of our businesses. 

SPLC is Shell&#8217;s principal midstream subsidiary in the United States. SPLC owns our general partner, a 57.4% limited partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights. 

Competition 

Competition among onshore common carrier crude oil pipelines is based primarily on posted tariffs, quality of customer service and connectivity to sources of supply and demand. We believe that our position along the Gulf Coast provides a unique level of service to our customers. Additionally, Zydeco is supported by FERC-approved transportation services agreements for the majority of the capacity available on the pipeline. Our pipelines and terminals face competition from a variety of alternative transportation methods including rail, water borne movements including barging, shipping and imports and other pipelines that service the same origins or destinations as our pipelines. 

Our offshore crude oil pipelines are partially supported by life-of-lease agreements or direct connected production. However, our offshore pipelines will compete for new production on the basis of geographic prox imity to the production, cost of connection, available capacity, transportation rates and access to onshore markets. The principal competition for our offshore pipelines include other crude oil pipeline systems as well as producers who may elect to build o r utilize their own production handling facilities. In addition, the ability of our offshore pipelines to access future reserves will be subject to our ability, or the producers&#8217; ability, to fund the significant capital expenditures required to connect to the new production. In general, our offshore pipelines are not subject to regulatory rate-making authority, and the rates our offshore pipeline charges for services are dependent on market conditions. 

Competition for refined product transportation in any particular area is affected significantly by the end market demand for the volume of products produced by refineries in that area, the availability of products in that area and the cost of transportation to that area from distant refineries. As a result of our contractual relationships, the markets they serve, and the size and scale of our refined products pipelines, we believe that our refined product pipelines will not face significant new competition in the near-term. 

At Lockport, our storage tanks are currently leased at 100.0% capacity under long-term contracts, and some contracts also guarantee payments for minimum monthly throughput volumes. A competing pipeline from Flannigan to Patoka, Illinois, owned by Enbridge Inc. and Marathon Petroleum Company, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily to transport Bakken crude oil, which was being previously shipped via railcars. This new pipeline will have no immediate material impact on our Lockport operations due to our long-term contracts. The use of pipelines to transport Bakken crude oil may eventually increase demand for storage and throughput at Lockport.

Control Center Operations 

The pipeline, storage and terminal systems that are operated by SPLC&#8217;s employees are controlled from a central control room located in Houston, Texas. The control center operates with a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system equipped with computer systems designed to continuously monitor operational data. Monitored data includes pressures, temperatures, gravities, flow rates and alarm conditions. The control center operates remote pumps, motors, and valves associated with the receipt and delivery of crude oil and refined products, and provides for the remote-controlled shutdown of pump stations and valves on the pipeline system. A fully functional back-up operations center is also maintained and routinely operated throughout the year to ensure safe and reliable operations. 

Colonial operates its pipeline system and Bengal&#8217;s tankage in a similar manner and has its own management team based in Alpharetta, Georgia. 

FERC and State Common Carrier Regulations 

Our interstate common carrier and state intrastate pipeline systems are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. 

FERC regulates interstate transportation on our common carrier pipeline systems under the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 as modified by the Elkins Act (&#8220;ICA&#8221;), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (&#8220;EPAct&#8221;) and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. FERC regulations require that rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined products (collectively referred to as &#8220;petroleum pipelines&#8221;) and certain other liquids, be just and reasonable and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC&#8217;s regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service. 

Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or proposed new or changed rates, services, or terms and conditions of service. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit a common carrier pipeline&#8217;s ability to charge rates until completion of an investigation during which FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful. In contrast, FERC has clarified that initial rates and terms of service agreed upon with committed shippers in a transportation services agreement are not subject to protest or a cost-of-service analysis where the pipeline held an open season offering all potential shippers service on the same terms. 

A successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier pipeline paying refunds of revenue collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate, together with interest for the period the rate was in effect, if any. FERC may also order a pipeline to reduce its rates prospectively, and may require a common carrier pipeline to pay shippers reparations retroactively for rate overages for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. 

We may at any time also be required to respond to governmental requests for information, including compliance audits conducted by FERC, such as the audit of Colonial. FERC&#8217;s Office of Enforcement concluded an audit of Colonial in Docket No. FA14-4-000 for 

the period January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2014, and issued a letter order on June 17, 2015 adopting the audi t&#8217;s findings and recommendations and requiring Colonial to submit a compliance plan and quarterly compliance reports. Colonial accepted the audit&#8217;s findings and recommendations, which had no financial impact to us. 

Additionally, EPAct deemed certain interstate petroleum pipeline rates then in effect to be just and reasonable under the ICA. These rates are commonly referred to as &#8220;grandfathered rates.&#8221; Colonial&#8217;s rates in effect at the time of the passage of EPAct for interstate transportation service were deemed just and reasonable and therefore are grandfathered. New rates have since been established after EPAct for certain grandfathered pipeline systems such as Zydeco. FERC may change grandfathered rates upon complaint only after it is shown that: 

&#160;

&#183; 

a substantial change has occurred since enactment in either the economic circumstances or the nature of the services that were a basis for the rate; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the complainant was contractually barred from challenging the rate prior to enactment of EPAct and filed the complaint within 30 days of the expiration of the contractual bar; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

a provision of the tariff is unduly discriminatory or preferential. 

EPAct required FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable methodology to adjust tariff rates for inflation for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, FERC adopted an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (&#8220;PPI-FG&#8221;). The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, including grandfathered rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates. FERC&#8217;s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. FERC recently completed its five-year review, revised its indexing methodology and determined that during the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, common carriers charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by PPI-FG plus 1.23%. The FERC ruling is still subject to appeal. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the index factor may change in the future. A pipeline is not required to raise its rates up to the index ceiling, but it is permitted to do so. Zydeco, Mars, Bengal and Colonial each made indexing filings in 2015 to increase applicable rates to a level at or below the index ceilings (certain of Zydeco&#8217;s rates were subsequently revised by a settlement, as discussed below). Rate increases made under the index are presumed to be just and reasonable and require a protesting party to demonstrate that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline&#8217;s increase in costs. Despite these procedural limits on challenging the indexing of rates, the overall rates are not entitled to any specific protection against rate challenges. Under the indexing rate methodology, in any year in which the index is negative, pipelines must file to lower their rates if those rates would otherwise be above the rate ceiling. 

While common carrier pipelines often use the indexing methodology to change their rates, common carrier pipelines may elect to support proposed rates by using other methodologies such as cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates, and settlement rates. A common carrier pipeline can propose a cost-of-service approach when seeking to increase its rates above the rate ceiling (or when seeking to avoid lowering rates to the reduced rate ceiling), but must establish that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. A common carrier can charge market based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. A common carrier can establish rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. Rates for a new service on a common carrier pipeline can be established through a negotiated rate with an unaffiliated shipper. 

The rates shown in our tariffs have been established using the indexing methodology, by settlement or by negotiation. If we used cost-of-service rate making to establish or support our rates on our different pipeline systems, the issue of the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes could arise. In 2005, FERC issued a policy statement stating that it would permit common carrier pipelines, among others, to include an income tax allowance in cost-of-service rates to reflect actual or potential tax liability attributable to a regulated entity&#8217;s operating income, regardless of the form of ownership. Under FERC&#8217;s policy, a tax pass-through entity seeking such an income tax allowance must establish that its partners or members have an actual or potential income tax liability on the regulated entity&#8217;s income. Whether a pipeline&#8217;s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability is subject to review by FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although this policy is generally favorable for common carrier pipelines that are organized as pass-through entities, it still entails rate risk due to FERC&#8217;s case-by-case review approach. The application of this policy, as well as any decision by FERC regarding our cost of service, is also subject to review in the courts. 

Intrastate services provided by certain of our pipeline systems are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities, such as the Texas Railroad Commission, which currently regulates Colonial and Zydeco pipeline rates; and the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which currently regulates the Mars, Colonial and Zydeco pipeline rates. State agencies typically require intrastate petroleum pipelines to file their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates and proposed rate increases. State agencies may also investigate rates, services, and terms and conditions of service on their own initiative. State regulatory commissions could limit our ability to increase our rates or to set rates based on our costs or order us to reduce our rates and require the payment of refunds to shippers. 

Further, rate investigations by FERC or a state commission could result in an investigation of our costs, including the: 

&#160;

&#183; 

overall cost of service, including operating costs and overhead; 

&#160;

&#183; 

allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the regulated entity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

appropriate rate of return on equity and interest rates on debt; 

&#160;

&#183; 

rate base, including the proper starting rate base; 

&#160;

&#183; 

throughput underlying the rate; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

proper allowance for federal and state income taxes. 

Shippers can always file a complaint with FERC or a state agency challenging rates or conditions of services. If they were successful, FERC or a state agency could order reparations or service charge. 

Certain of our pipelines, including Auger and parts of Mars, are located offshore in the Outer Continental Shelf. As such, they are not subject to FERC or state rate regulation, but are subject to the Outer Continental Lands Act (&#8220;OCSLA&#8221;). Under the OCSLA, we must provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both pipeline owner and non-owner shippers, and comply with other requirements. 

Pipeline Safety 

Our assets are subject to increasingly strict safety laws and regulations. Our transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products involve a risk that hazardous liquids may be released into the environment, potentially causing harm to the public or the environment. In turn, such incidents may result in substantial expenditures for response actions, significant government penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) of the Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our assets. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and necessary maintenance or repairs. These regulations also require that pipeline operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans. 

We are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (&#8220;HLPSA&#8221;). The HLPSA delegated to PHMSA through DOT the authority to develop, prescribe, and enforce federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. Congress also enacted the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, which added the environment to the list of statutory factors that must be considered in establishing safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, required regulations be issued to define the term &#8220;gathering line&#8221; and establish safety standards for certain &#8220;regulated gathering lines,&#8221; and mandated that regulations be issued to establish criteria for operators to use in identifying and inspecting pipelines located in High Consequence Areas (&#8220;HCAs&#8221;). In 1996, Congress enacted the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act, which limited the operator identification requirement mandate to pipelines that cross a waterway where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists, required that certain areas where a pipeline rupture would likely cause permanent or long-term environmental damage be considered in determining whether an area is unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and mandated that regulations be issued for the qualification and testing of certain pipeline personnel. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 established mandatory inspections for all United States oil transportation pipelines, and some gathering lines in HCAs. In the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006, Congress required mandatory inspections for certain U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and mandated that regulations be issued for low-stress hazardous liquids pipelines and pipeline control room management. We are also subject to the Pipeline Safety Act of 2011, which reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. 

PHMSA administers compliance with these statutes and has promulgated comprehensive safety standards and regulations for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, including regulations for the design and construction of new pipeline systems or those that have been relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed (Subparts C and D of 49 CFR &#167; 195); pressure testing of new pipelines (Subpart E of 49 CFR &#167; 195); operation and maintenance of pipeline systems, including inspecting and reburying pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets, establishing programs for public awareness and damage prevention, managing the integrity of pipelines in HCAs, and managing the operation of pipeline control rooms (Subpart F of 49 CFR &#167; 195); protecting steel pipelines from the adverse effects of internal and external corrosion (Subpart H of 49 CFR &#167; 195); and integrity management requirements for pipelines in HCAs (49 CFR &#167; 195.452). On October 1, 2015, PHMSA proposed to extend reporting requirements to currently unregulated hazardous liquid gravity-flow and gathering lines, and to require additional or enhanced inspection, monitoring, data integration and repair programs for many currently regulated lines.

The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, as well as any implementation of PHMSA rules thereunder, could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis; any or all of which tasks could result in our incurring increased operating costs that could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. Howe ver, we do not anticipate we would be impacted by these regulatory initiatives to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors. In addition, PHMSA recently published an advisory bulletin providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure. We have performed hydrotests of our facilities to confirm the maximum allowable operating pressure and do not expect that any final rulemaking by PHMSA regarding verification of maximum allowable operating pressure would materially affect our operations or revenue. In addition, states have adopted regulations, similar to existing PHMSA regulations, for intrastate gathering and transmission lines. The states in which our assets are located, Texas and Louisia na, are among the states that have developed regulatory programs that parallel the federal regulatory scheme and are applicable to intrastate pipelines transporting crude oil. 

We monitor the structural integrity of our pipelines through a program of periodic internal assessments using a variety of internal inspection tools, as well as hydrostatic testing that conforms to federal standards. We accompany these assessments with a comprehensive data integration effort and repair anomalies, as required, to ensure the integrity of the pipeline. We conduct a thorough review of risks to the pipelines and perform sophisticated calculations to establish an appropriate reassessment interval for each pipeline. We use external coatings and impressed current cathodic protection systems to protect against external corrosion. We conduct all cathodic protection work in accordance with National Association of Corrosion Engineers standards and continually monitor, test and record the effectiveness of these corrosion inhibiting systems. We have robust third party damage prevention programs to help protect our lines from the risk of excavation and other outside force damage threats. Our tanks are inspected on a routine basis in compliance with PHMSA and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) regulations. Every tank periodically receives a full out of service, internal inspection per American Petroleum Institute standard 653 and is repaired as necessary to ensure long term integrity and reliability. 

Product Quality Standards 

Refined products that we transport are generally sold by our customers for consumption by the public. Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe product quality specifications for refined products. Changes in product quality specifications or blending requirements could reduce our throughput volumes, require us to incur additional handling costs or require capital expenditures. For example, different product specifications for different markets affect the fungibility of the refined products in our system and could require the construction of additional storage. If we are unable to recover these costs through increased revenue, our cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the product quality of the refined products we receive on our refined product pipeline systems or at our tank farms could reduce or eliminate our ability to blend refined products. 

Security 

We are also subject to Department of Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities and to Transportation Security Administration Pipeline Security Guidelines. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with all of these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of our facilities. 

While we are not currently subject to governmental standards for the protection of computer-based systems and technology from cyber threats and attacks, proposals to establish such standards are being considered by the U.S. Congress and by U.S. Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, and we may become subject to such standards in the future. We are currently implementing our own cyber-security programs and protocols; however, we cannot guarantee their effectiveness. A significant cyber-attack could have a material effect on operations and those of our customers. 

Environmental Matters 

General. Our operations are subject to extensive and frequently-changing federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment. Among other things, these laws and regulations govern the emission or discharge of pollutants into or onto the land, air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination. As with the industry in general, compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and upgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we believe they do not affect our competitive position, as the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are subject to changes, or to changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, by regulatory authorities, and continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures. Additionally, violation of environmental laws, regulations, and permits 

can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the construction of additional fac ilities or equipment. Additionally, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured, subject us to substantial expenses, including costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury or property damage, or by the U.S. federal government or state governments for natural resources damages. These impacts could directly and indirectly affect our business and have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. We cannot currently determine the amounts of such future impacts. 

Air Emissions and Climate Change. Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and its regulations and comparable state and local statutes and regulations in connection with air emissions from our operations. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new source of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed. These permits may require controls on our air emission sources, and we may become subject to more stringent regulations requiring the installation of additional emission control technologies. 

Future expenditures may be required to comply with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our various sites, including our pipeline and storage facilities. The impact of future legislative and regulatory developments, if enacted or adopted, could result in increased compliance costs and additional operating restrictions on our business, all of which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 

In December 2007, Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act that created a second Renewable Fuels Standard. This standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced annually in the U.S. to rise to 36 billion gallons by 2022. The requirements could reduce future demand for refined products and thereby have an indirect effect on certain aspects of our business. 

Currently, various legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and other gases) are in various phases of discussion or implementation in the United States. These include requirements effective in 2010 to report emissions of greenhouse gases to the EPA on an annual basis, and proposed federal legislation and regulation as well as state actions to develop statewide or regional programs, each of which require or could require reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions. Requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments. These requirements may also significantly affect domestic refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not believe the federal greenhouse gas reporting rule, as described above, or the greenhouse gas &#8220;tailoring&#8221; rule, which subjects certain facilities to the additional permitting obligations under the New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act based on a facility&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

In addition, the EPA has proposed and may adopt further regulations under the Clean Air Act addressing greenhouse gases, to which some of our facilities may become subject. For example, in September 2015, EPA proposed new rules for volatile organic compound and methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Congress continues to consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions, which may include a delay in the implementation of greenhouse gas regulations by EPA or a limitation on EPA&#8217;s authority to regulate greenhouse gases, although the ultimate adoption and form of any federal legislation cannot presently be predicted. In addition, in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement will be open for signing on April 22, 2016 and will require countries to review and &#8220;represent a progression&#8221; in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The impact of future regulatory and legislative developments, if adopted or enacted, including any cap-and-trade program or any carbon-based taxing initiative, is likely to result in increased compliance costs, increased utility costs, additional operating restrictions on our business, and an increase in the cost of products generally. Although such costs may impact our business directly or indirectly by impacting our facilities or operations, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. 

Waste Management and Related Liabilities. To a large extent, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater and surface water, and include measures to control pollution of the environment. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. They also require corrective action, including investigation and remediation, at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed. 

CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), which is also known as Superfund, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or to the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the former and present owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and the transporters and generators of the hazardous substances found at the site. 

Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CE RCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we generate waste that falls wi thin CERCLA&#8217;s definition of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites. Pursuant to the omnibus agreement we entered into on November 3, 2014 with SPLC (&#8220;Omnibus Agreement&#8221;), SPLC indemnifies us and will fund all of the costs of required remedial action for our known historical and legacy spills and releases and, subject to a deductible of $0.5 million per claim and aggregate monetary cap of $15.0 million for all environmental, title and litigation claims, for spills and releases, if any, existing but unknown at the time of closing of the IPO to the extent such existing but unknown spills and releases are identified within three years after closing of the IPO. 

RCRA. We also generate solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes. Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes. Any changes in the regulations could increase our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. 

Hydrocarbon Wastes. We currently own and lease, and SPLC has in the past owned and leased, properties where hydrocarbons are being or for many years have been handled. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. These properties and hydrocarbons and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater), or to perform remedial operations to prevent further contamination. 

Indemnity Under the Omnibus Agreement . Under the Omnibus Agreement, SPLC will indemnify us for all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities that are associated with the ownership or operation of our assets and due to occurrences on or before November 3, 2014, the closing date of the IPO. Indemnification for any unknown environmental liabilities will be limited to liabilities due to occurrences on or before the closing of the IPO and identified prior to the third anniversary of the closing of the IPO, and will be subject to an aggregate deductible of $0.5 million before we are entitled to indemnification for losses incurred in excess of that deductible. Once we meet the deductible, SPLC&#8217;s indemnity obligation for all environmental, title and litigation claims is capped at $15.0 million. We will not be indemnified for any future spills or releases of hydrocarbons or hazardous materials at our facilities, or for any other environmental liabilities resulting from our own operations. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify SPLC for events and conditions associated with the ownership or operation of our assets due to occurrences after the closing of the IPO and for environmental liabilities related to our assets to the extent SPLC is not required to indemnify us for such liabilities. Liabilities for which we will indemnify SPLC pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement are not subject to a deductible before SPLC is entitled to indemnification. There is no limit on the amount for which we will indemnify SPLC under the Omnibus Agreement. As a result, we may incur such expenses in the future, which may be substantial. 

Indemnity Under the May 2015 Purchase Agreement. Under our purchase and sale agreement with SPLC we acquired (the &#8220;May 2015 Acquisition&#8221;) an additional 19.5% interest in Zydeco and an additional 1.388% interest in Colonial (the &#8220;Purchase and Sale Agreement&#8221;). SPLC will indemnify us for losses arising from SPLC&#8217;s breach of representations or warranties relating to environmental matters that are associated with the ownership or operation of the assets held by Zydeco and due to occurrences on or before May 18, 2015, the closing date of the May 2015 Acquisition. SPLC&#8217;s indemnification for breaches of representations or warranties relating to environmental matters will terminate and expire on the third anniversary of the closing date of the May 2015 Acquisition, and will be subject to an aggregate deductible of $1.0 million for any breaches of representations and warranties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement before we are entitled to indemnification for losses incurred in excess of that deductible. Once we meet the deductible, SPLC&#8217;s indemnity obligation for all breaches of representations and warranties under the Purchase and Sale Agreement is capped at $44.8 million. Damages incurred under the Purchase and Sale Agreement are limited to 19.5% of the total of damages incurred as a result of a breach of representations or warranties relating to environmental matters that are associated with the ownership or operation of the assets held by Zydeco. We will not be indemnified for any future spills or releases of hydrocarbons or hazardous materials at our facilities, or for any other environmental liabilities resulting from our own operations. 

Indemnity Under the Poseidon Contribution Agreement. Under our purchase and sale agreement with SOPUS for Poseidon (the &#8220;Poseidon Contribution Agreement&#8221;), SPLC will indemnify us for losses arising from SOPUS&#8217;s breach of representations or warranties relating to environmental matters that are associated with the ownership or operation of the assets held by Pecten and due to occurrences on or before July 1, 2015, the closing date of our acquisition of Poseidon. SPLC&#8217;s indemnification for breaches of 

representations or warranties relating to environmental matte rs will terminate and expire on the third anniversary of the closing date of acquisition of Poseidon, and will be subject to an aggregate deductible of $1.0 million for any breaches of representations and warranties under the Poseidon Contribution Agreemen t before we are entitled to indemnification for losses incurred in excess of that deductible. Once we meet the deductible, SPLC&#8217;s indemnity obligation for all breaches of representations and warranties under the Poseidon Contribution Agreement is capped a t $35.0 million. Damages incurred under the Poseidon Contribution Agreement are limited to 36.0% of the total of damages incurred as a result of a breach of representations or warranties relating to environmental matters that are associated with the owners hip or operation of the assets held by Poseidon. We will not be indemnified for any future spills or releases of hydrocarbons or hazardous materials at our facilities, or for any other environmental liabilities resulting from our own operations. 

Indemnity Under the Pecten Contribution Agreement. Under our contribution agreement with SPLC for Pecten (the &#8220;Pecten Contribution Agreement&#8221;), SPLC will indemnify us for all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities that are associated with the ownership or operation of Auger and Lockport and due to occurrences on or before October 1, 2015, the closing date of our acquisition of Pecten. Indemnification for any unknown environmental liabilities will be limited to liabilities due to occurrences on or before the closing date of our acquisition of Pecten and identified, to the extent they relate to Auger, prior to the third anniversary, and, to the extent they relate to Lockport, prior to the fourth anniversary, of the closing date of our acquisition of Pecten. SPLC&#8217;s indemnity obligation for all environmental, title and litigation claims is capped at $78.0 million. We will not be indemnified for any future spills or releases of hydrocarbons or hazardous materials at Auger and Lockport, or for any other environmental liabilities resulting from our operations. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify SPLC for events and conditions associated with the ownership or operation of Auger and Lockport due to occurrences after October 1, 2015 and for environmental liabilities related to our assets to the extent SPLC is not required to indemnify us for such liabilities. Liabilities for which we will indemnify SPLC pursuant to the Pecten Contribution Agreement are not subject to a deductible before SPLC is entitled to indemnification. There is no limit on the amount for which we will indemnify SPLC under the Pecten Contribution Agreement. As a result, we may incur such expenses in the future, which may be substantial. 

Water. Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and refined products. Regulations under the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (&#8220;Clean Water Act&#8221;), Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA-90&#8221;) and state laws impose regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and some state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture, or leak. For example, the Clean Water Act requires us to maintain Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (&#8220;SPCC&#8221;) plans at many of our facilities. We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the Clean Water Act and have implemented tracking systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable storm water permitting requirements. 

In addition, the transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions of OPA-90 and related state requirements. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate facilities at which releases of oil and hazardous substances could occur. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established SPCC plans for facilities subject to Clean Water Act SPCC requirements. 

Construction or maintenance of our pipelines, tank farms and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are also regulated under the Clean Water Act by the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Regulatory requirements governing wetlands (including associated mitigation projects) may result in the delay of our pipeline projects while we obtain necessary permits and may increase the cost of new projects and maintenance activities. 

Employee Safety. We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. 

Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. If endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where we wish to conduct development activities, such work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. In addition, the designation of new endangered species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating or development restrictions or bans in the affected area. 

Title to Properties and Permits 

Substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights-of-way granted by the apparent record owners of the property and, in some instances, these rights-of-way are revocable at the election of the grantor. In many instances, lands over which rights-of-way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right-of-way grants. We have obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under, or to lay facilities in or along, watercourses, county roads, municipal streets, and state highways and, in some instances, these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor. We have also obtained permits from railroad companies to cross over or under lands or rights-of-way, many of which are also revocable at the grantor&#8217;s election. In some states and under some circumstances, we have the right of eminent domain to acquire rights-of-way and lands necessary for our common carrier pipelines. 

Insurance 

All our assets other than Mars are insured at the entity level for certain property damage, business interruption and third-party liabilities, which include pollution liabilities, in amounts which management believes are reasonable and appropriate. Mars is self-insured by its current owners; however, we carry commercial insurance (other than named windstorm coverage) for our pro rata portion of Mars&#8217; liabilities. 

Employees 

We do not have any employees. We are managed and operated by the directors and officers of our general partner. Zydeco, Mars, Bengal and Auger&#8217;s pipeline systems, and Lockport&#8217;s storage and terminal systems are operated by SPLC&#8217;s employees pursuant to operating and maintenance agreements with the entities that own such pipelines. Colonial is operated by its employees. Employees of Colonial operate Bengal&#8217;s tankage. Employees of an affiliate of the other member of Poseidon operate Poseidon&#8217;s pipelines.
