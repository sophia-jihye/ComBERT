 Item 1. Business. Our company 

We are a highly differentiated and fast-growing, extreme value retailer of brand name merchandise at drastically reduced prices. Known for our assortment of &#147;Good Stuff Cheap,&#148; we offer customers a broad selection of brand name products, including food, housewares, books and stationery, bed and bath, floor coverings, hardware and toys. Our differentiated go-to market strategy is characterized by a unique, fun and engaging treasure hunt shopping experience, compelling customer value proposition and witty, humorous in-store signage and advertising campaigns. These attributes have driven our rapid growth and strong and consistent store performance. 

Mark Butler, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, co-founded Ollie&#146;s in 1982, based on the idea that &#147;everyone in America loves a bargain.&#148; Since opening our first store in Mechanicsburg, PA, we have expanded throughout the Eastern half of the United States. From the time Mr. Butler assumed his current position as President and Chief Executive Officer in 2003, we have grown from operating 28 stores in three states to 203 stores in 17 states as of January 30, 2016. Our no-frills, &#147;semi-lovely&#148; warehouse style stores average approximately 33,000 square feet and generate consistently strong financial returns across all vintages, geographic regions, population densities, demographic groups, real estate formats and regardless of any co-tenant. Our business model has resulted in positive financial performance during strong and weak economic cycles. Since 1998, 100% of our stores have generated positive four-wall EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, and prior to that, we believe all of our stores were profitable in each fiscal year since opening our first store in 1982. We believe there is opportunity for more than 950 Ollie&#146;s locations across the United States based on internal estimates and third party research conducted by Jeff Green Partners, a retail real estate feasibility consultant that provides market analysis and strategic planning and consulting services. 

Our constantly changing merchandise assortment is procured by a highly experienced merchant team, who leverage deep, long-standing relationships with hundreds of major manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, brokers and retailers. These relationships enable our merchant team to find and select only the best buys from a broad range of brand name and closeout product offerings and to pass drastically reduced prices along to our customers. As we grow, we believe our increased scale will provide us with even greater access to brand name products because many large manufacturers favor large buyers capable of acquiring an entire deal. Our merchant team augments these deals with directly sourced products including Ollie&#146;s own private label brands and other products exclusive to Ollie&#146;s. 

Our business model has produced consistently strong growth and financial performance. From fiscal year 2010 to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 (&#147;fiscal year 2015&#148;) (except as noted): 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Our store base expanded from 95 stores to 203 stores, a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR of 16.1% and we entered nine new states. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; New stores opened from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014 produced average cash-on-cash returns of 63% in their first 12 months of operations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Comparable store sales grew at an average rate of 2.8% per year. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Net sales increased from $335.7 million to $762.4 million, a CAGR of 17.5%. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Net income increased from $19.1 million to $35.8 million. &#160;

We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and serve as the foundation for our current and future growth: 

&#147; Good Stuff Cheap&#148;&#151;Ever changing product assortment at drastically reduced prices . Our stores offer something for everyone across a diverse range of merchandise categories at prices up to 70% below department and fancy stores and up to 20-50% below mass market retailers. Our product assortment frequently changes based on the wide variety of deals available from the hundreds of brand name suppliers we have relationships with. We augment these opportunistic deals on brand name merchandise with directly sourced unbranded products or those under our own private label brands such as Sarasota Breeze, Steelton Tools and American Way and exclusively licensed recognizable brands and celebrity names such as Magnavox, Marcus Samuelsson Signature Cookware and Kasey Kahne Car Care. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented approximately 70% and non-closeout goods and private label products collectively represented approximately 30% of our fiscal year 2015 merchandise purchases. Our treasure hunt shopping environment and slogan &#147;when it&#146;s gone, it&#146;s gone&#148; help to instill a &#147;shop now&#148; sense of urgency that encourages frequent customer visits. 

Highly experienced and disciplined merchant team . Our 13-member merchant team maintains strong, long-standing relationships with a diverse group of suppliers, allowing us to procure branded merchandise at compelling values for our customers. This team is led by five senior merchants, including Mark Butler, and has over 107 years of combined industry experience and 90 combined years of experience at Ollie&#146;s. We have been doing business with our top 15 suppliers for an average of 13 years, and only one supplier accounted for more than 5% of our purchases during the fiscal year 2015. Our well-established relationships with our suppliers together with our scale, buying power, financial credibility and responsiveness often makes Ollie&#146;s the first call for available deals. Our direct relationships with our suppliers have increased as we have grown and we continuously strive to broaden our supplier network. These factors provide us with increased access to goods, which enables us to be more selective in our deal-making and which we believe helps us provide compelling value and assortment of goods to our customers and fuels our continued profitable growth. 

Distinctive brand and engaging shopping experience . Our distinctive and often self-deprecating humor and highly recognizable caricatures are used in our stores, flyers, mailers, website and email campaigns. We attempt to make our customers laugh as we poke fun at ourselves and current events. We believe this approach creates a strong connection to our brand and sets us apart from other, more traditional retailers. Our &#147;semi-lovely&#148; stores feature these same brand attributes together with witty signage in a warehouse format that create a fun, relaxed and engaging shopping environment. We believe that by disarming our customers by getting them to giggle a bit, they are more likely to look at and trust our products for what they are&#151;extremely great bargains. We offer a 

&#160;

&#147;30-day no hard time guarantee&#148; as a means to overcome any skepticism associated with our cheap prices and to build trust and loyalty, because if our customers are not happy, we are not happy. We welcome customers to bring back their merchandise within that timeframe for a &#147;no hard time&#148; full refund. We also make it easy for our customers to browse our stores by displaying our products on easily accessible fixtures and by keeping the stores clean and well-lit. We believe our humorous brand image, compelling values and welcoming stores resonate with our customers and define Ollie&#146;s as a unique and comfortable destination shopping location. 

Extremely loyal &#147;Ollie&#146;s Army&#148; customer base. Our best customers are members of our Ollie&#146;s Army customer loyalty program, which stands at 6.4 million members as of January 30, 2016. For fiscal year 2015, over 60% of our sales were from Ollie&#146;s Army members, and we have grown our base of loyal members by 32.6% in fiscal year 2015. Ollie&#146;s Army members spend approximately 40% more per shopping trip at Ollie&#146;s, typically shop more frequently than non-members, and are willing to drive upwards of 25 minutes to shop at our stores. We identify our target customer as &#147;anyone between the ages of 25-70 with a wallet or a purse&#148; seeking a great bargain. Our consumer research supports this approach, revealing that we appeal to a broad demographic spanning a wide range of household incomes, with more than 60% of Ollie&#146;s Army members having an average household income over $50,000. 

Strong and consistent store model built for growth. We employ a proven new store model that generates strong cash flow, consistent financial results and attractive returns on investment regardless of the economic environment. Our highly flexible real estate approach has proven successful across all vintages, geographic regions, population densities, demographic groups, real estate formats and regardless of any co-tenant. Our new store model targets a cash-on-cash return of 55% in the first 12 months of operations and a payback period of approximately two years. New stores opened from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014 produced average cash-on-cash returns of 63% in their first 12 months of operations. Since 2010, our new stores have generated an average of $3.9 million in net sales in their first 12 months of operations and produced an average payback period of approximately two years. We believe that our consistent store performance, recently opened distribution center in Commerce, GA and disciplined approach to site selection support the portability and predictability of our new unit growth strategy. 

Highly experienced and passionate founder-led management team . Our leadership team, directed by our co-founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Butler, has guided our organization through its expansion and positioned us for continued growth. Mark Butler has assembled a talented and dedicated team of executives with an average of 24 years of retail experience, including an average 10 years of experience at Ollie&#146;s. Our senior executives possess extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines, including merchandising, marketing, real estate, finance, store operations, supply chain management and information technology. We believe by encouraging equity ownership and fostering a strong team culture, we have aligned the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders. As a result, no member of the executive management team (any Vice President or higher classification) has ever chosen to leave Ollie&#146;s to work for another company. We believe these factors result in a cohesive team focused on sustainable long-term growth. 

Our growth strategy 

We plan to continue to drive growth in sales and profitability by executing on the following strategies: 

Grow our store base. We believe our compelling value proposition and the success of our stores across a broad range of geographic regions, population densities and demographic groups creates a significant opportunity to profitably increase our store count. Our internal estimates and third party research conducted by Jeff Green Partners indicate the potential for more than 950 national locations. Our new store real estate model is flexible and focuses predominately on second generation sites ranging in size from 25,000 to 35,000 square feet. We believe there is an ample supply of suitable low-cost, second generation real estate to allow us to infill within our existing markets as well as to expand into new, contiguous geographies. This approach leverages our distribution infrastructure, field management team, store management, marketing investments and brand awareness. We expect our new store openings to be the primary driver of our continued, consistent growth in sales and profitability. 

&#160;

Increase our offerings of great bargains. We will continue to enhance our supplier relationships and develop additional sources to acquire brand name and closeout products for our customers. Our strong sourcing relationships with leading major manufacturers and our purchasing scale provide us with significant opportunities to expand our ever changing assortment of brand name and closeout merchandise at extreme values. We plan to further invest in our merchandising team in order to expand and enhance our sourcing relationships and product categories, which we expect will drive shopping frequency and increase customer spending. 

Leverage and expand Ollie&#146;s Army. We intend to recruit new Ollie&#146;s Army members and increase their frequency of store visits and spending by enhancing our distinctive, fun and recognizable marketing programs, building brand awareness, rewarding member loyalty and utilizing more sophisticated data driven targeted marketing. We believe these strategies, coupled with a larger store base, will enable us to increase the amount of sales driven by loyal Ollie&#146;s Army customers seeking the next great deal. 

Our merchandise 

Strategy 

We offer a highly differentiated, constantly evolving assortment of brand name merchandise across a broad range of categories at drastically reduced prices. Our ever changing assortment of &#147;Good Stuff Cheap&#148; includes brand name and closeout merchandise from leading manufacturers. We augment our brand name merchandise with opportunistic purchases of unbranded goods and our own domestic and direct-import private label brands in underpenetrated categories to further enhance the assortment of products that we offer. Brand name and closeout merchandise represented approximately 70% and non-closeout goods and private label products collectively represented approximately 30% of our fiscal year 2015 merchandise purchases. We believe our compelling value proposition and the unique nature of our merchandise offerings have fostered our customer appeal across a variety of demographics and socioeconomic profiles. 

Our warehouse format stores feature on average more than 130,000 active stock-keeping units across a broad number of categories including food, housewares, books and stationery, bed and bath, floor coverings, hardware and toys as well as other products including electronics, personal health care, candy, clothing, sporting goods, pet and lawn and garden products. We focus on buying cheap to sell cheap and source products as unique buying opportunities present themselves. Our merchandise mix is designed to combine unique and brand name bargains at extremely attractive price points. This approach results in frequently changing product assortments and localized offerings which encourage shopper frequency and a &#147;shop now&#148; sense of urgency as customers hunt to discover the next deal. 

The common element of our dynamic merchandise selection is the consistent delivery of great deals to our customers, with products offered at prices up to 70% below department stores and fancy stores and up to 20-50% below mass market retailers. Our product price tags allow customers to compare our competitor&#146;s price against Ollie&#146;s price to further highlight the savings they can realize by shopping at our stores. 

&#160;

Product mix 

Examples of our product offerings include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Food: packaged food including coffee, bottled non-carbonated beverages, salty snacks, condiments, sauces, spices, dry pasta, canned goods, cereal and cookies; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Housewares: cooking utensils, dishes, appliances, plastic containers, cutlery, storage and garbage bags, detergents and cleaning supplies, cookware and glassware, fans and space heaters, candles, frames and giftware; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Other: electronics, personal health care, candy, clothing, sporting goods, pet products, luggage, automotive, seasonal, furniture, summer furniture and lawn &#38; garden. The following chart shows the breakdown of our fiscal year 2015 net sales by merchandise category: 

&#160;

Product categories 

We maintain consistent average margins across our primary product categories described below. 

Brand name and closeout merchandise (approximately 70% of merchandise purchases in fiscal year 2015) 

Our focus is to provide huge savings to our customers primarily through brand name products across a broad range of merchandise. Our experienced merchant team purchases deeply discounted, branded or closeout merchandise primarily from manufacturers, retailers, distributors and brokers. This merchandise includes overstocks, discontinued merchandise, package changes, cancelled orders, excess inventory and buybacks from retailers and major manufacturers. 

&#160;

Non-closeout goods/private label (approximately 30% of merchandise purchases in fiscal year 2015) 

We augment the breadth of our brand name merchandise with non-closeout and private label merchandise. In categories where the consumer is not as brand conscious, such as home textiles, home storage and furniture, or when we may not be offering a current brand name merchandise deal, we will buy deeply discounted unbranded merchandise. These extreme value offerings are mixed in the stores with our brand name merchandise. We also have a variety of domestic and direct-import private label merchandise and exclusive products sold under brands such as Sarasota Breeze, Steelton Tools and American Way. These high quality products are developed in key categories such as housewares, are designed to create brand-like excitement and complement our brand name merchandise. We also have licenses for private label products that use recognizable celebrity names like Marcus Samuelsson, Josh Capon and Kasey Kahne, or brand names like Country Living, Magnavox, Popular Mechanics and Wells Lamont. We routinely evaluate the quality and condition of these private label goods to ensure that we are delivering our customer a high quality product at a great price. 

Merchandise procurement and distribution 

Our disciplined buying strategy and strict adherence to purchasing margins support our merchandising strategy of buying cheap to sell cheap. 

Merchandising team 

Our 13-member merchant team maintains strong, long-standing relationships with a diverse group of suppliers, allowing us to procure branded merchandise at compelling values for our customers. This team is led by five senior merchants, including Mark Butler, and has over 107 years of combined industry experience and 90 combined years of experience at Ollie&#146;s. Our merchants specialize by department in order to build category expertise, in-depth knowledge and sourcing relationships. We believe our buying approach coupled with long-standing and newly formed relationships enable us to find the best deals from major manufacturers and pass drastically reduced prices along to our customers. We plan to further invest in and grow our merchandising team in order to expand and enhance our sourcing relationships and product categories, which we expect will drive shopping frequency and increase customer spending. 

Merchandise procurement 

We believe that our strong sourcing capabilities are the result of our tenured merchant team&#146;s ability to leverage deep, long-standing relationships with hundreds of manufacturers, wholesalers, brokers, retailers and other suppliers. Our merchants maintain direct relationships with brand manufacturers, regularly attend more than 60 tradeshows per year and travel the world to source extreme value offerings across a broad assortment of product categories. We are an ideal partner to major manufacturers because our merchants are experienced and empowered to make quick decisions. Each opportunity is unique and our merchants negotiate directly with the supplier to lock in a particular deal. Our ability to select the most attractive opportunistic purchases from a growing number of available deals enables us to provide a wide assortment of goods to our customers at great deals. 

We source from over 1,000 suppliers, with only one supplier accounting for more than 5% of our purchases during the fiscal year 2015. Our dedication to building strong relationships with suppliers is evidenced by a 13-year average relationship with our top 15 suppliers. As we grow, we believe our increased scale will provide us with even greater access to brand name products since many major manufacturers seek a single buyer to acquire the entire deal. 

&#160;

Distribution and logistics 

We have made significant investments to support our store growth plan. In April 2014, we opened our second distribution center, located in Commerce, GA, to support our store operations and expansion plans in the Southeast. We distribute approximately 94% of our merchandise from our 603,000 square foot distribution center in York, PA and our 554,040 square foot distribution center in Commerce, GA that will increase annually to 962,280 square feet by November 2017. In order to minimize the amount of time our retail stores devote to inventory management, all of our merchandise is seeded with price tickets and labeled with a bar code for shipping. 

Our stores generally receive shipments from our distribution centers two to three times a week, depending on the season and specific store size and sales volume. We utilize independent third party freight carriers and, on average, load and ship between 40 and 50 trucks per day. We believe our existing distribution capabilities will support our anticipated store growth of between 375 to 400 stores over the next several years. 

Our stores 

As of January 30, 2016, we operated 203 stores averaging approximately 33,000 square feet across 17 contiguous states in the Eastern half of the United States. Our highly flexible real estate approach has proven successful across all vintages, geographic regions, population densities, demographic groups, real estate formats and regardless of any co-tenant. Our business model has resulted in positive financial performance during strong and weak economic cycles. Since 1998, 100% of our stores have generated positive four-wall EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, and prior to that, we believe all of our stores were profitable in each fiscal year since opening our first store in 1982. We have successfully opened stores in nine new states since fiscal year 2010, highlighting the portability of our new store model. The following map shows the number of stores in each of the states in which we operated as of January 30, 2016: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Store design and layout 

All of our warehouse format stores incorporate the same philosophy: no-frills, bright, &#147;semi-lovely&#148; stores and a fun, treasure hunt shopping experience. We present our stores as &#147;semi-lovely&#148; to differentiate our stores from other traditional retailers, and to minimize operating and build-out costs. Our stores also welcome our customers with vibrant and colorful caricatures together with witty signage. We attempt to make our customers laugh as we poke fun at ourselves and current events. We believe that by disarming our customers by getting them to giggle a bit, they are able to look at and trust our products for what they are&#151;extremely great bargains. 

We believe the store layout and merchandising strategy helps to instill a &#147;shop now&#148; sense of urgency and increase frequency of customer visits as customers never know what they might come across in our stores. We make it easy for our customers to browse our stores by displaying our frequently changing assortment of products on rolling tables, pallets and other display fixtures. Our store team leaders are responsible for maintaining our treasure hunt shopping experience, keeping the stores clean and well-lit and ensuring our customers are engaged. We believe our humorous brand image, compelling values and welcoming stores resonate with our customers and define Ollie&#146;s as a unique and comfortable destination shopping location. 

Expansion opportunities and site selection 

We believe we can profitably expand our store count on a national scale to more than 950 locations based on internal estimates and third party research conducted by Jeff Green Partners. We plan to continue to expand into attractive markets in the Southeastern United States, including Florida and Mississippi. Our disciplined real estate strategy focuses on infilling existing geographies as well as expanding into contiguous markets in order to leverage our distribution infrastructure, field management team, store management, marketing investments and brand awareness. 

We maintain a pipeline of real estate sites that have been approved by our real estate committee. Our recent store growth is summarized in the following table: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Fiscal year &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; Stores open at beginning of period

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; We utilize a rigorous site selection and real estate approval process in order to leverage our infrastructure, marketing investments and brand awareness. Members of our real estate team spend considerable time evaluating prospective sites before bringing a new lease proposal to our real estate committee, which is composed of senior management and executive officers. Our flexible store layout allows us to quickly take over a variety of low-cost, second generation sites including former big box retail and grocery stores. We believe there is an ample supply of suitable low-cost, second generation real estate allowing us to infill within our existing markets as well as to expand into new, contiguous geographies. By focusing on key characteristics such as proximity to the nearest Ollie&#146;s store, ability to leverage distribution infrastructure, visibility, traffic counts, population densities of at least 50,000 people within ten miles and low rent per square foot, we have developed a new store real estate model that has consistently delivered attractive returns on invested capital. 

&#160;

Our strong unit growth is supported by our predictable and compelling new store model. We target a store size between 25,000 to 35,000 square feet and an average initial cash investment of approximately $1.0 million, which includes store fixtures and equipment, store-level and distribution center inventory (net of payables) and pre-opening expenses. With our relatively low investment costs and strong new store opening performance, we target new store sales of $3.7 million and a cash-on-cash return of 55% in the first 12 months of operation. New stores opened from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014 produced average cash-on-cash returns of 63% in their first 12 months of operations. Since 2010, our new stores have generated an average of $3.9 million in net sales in their first full year of operations and produced an average payback period of approximately two years. We believe that our consistent store performance, corporate infrastructure, including our recently opened second distribution center, and disciplined approach to site selection support the portability and predictability of our new unit growth strategy. 

Store-level management and training 

Our Senior Vice President of Store Operations oversees all store activities. Our stores are grouped into two regions, divided generally along geographic lines. We employ two regional directors, who have responsibility for the day to day operations of the stores in their region. Reporting to the regional directors are 21 district team leaders who each manage a group of stores in their markets. At the store level, the leadership team consists of a store team leader (manager), co-team leader (first level assistant manager) and assistant team leader (second level assistant manager). Supervisors oversee specific areas within each store. 

Each store team leader is responsible for the daily operations of the store, including the processing of merchandise to the sales floor and the presentation of goods throughout the store. Store team leaders are trained to maintain a clean and appealing store environment for our customers. Store team leaders and co-team leaders are also responsible for the hiring, training and development of associates. While each store&#146;s sales volume is reviewed to determine the optimal store-level staffing requirements, our typical store employs 16 to 30 associates. Part-time associates generally comprise 65% of the associates in a typical store, with the remaining 35% being full-time associates. 

We work tirelessly to hire talented people, to improve our ability to assess talent during the interview process and to regularly train those individuals at Ollie&#146;s who are responsible for interviewing candidates. We also devote substantial resources to training our new managers through our Team Leader Training Program. This program operates at designated training stores located across our footprint. It provides an in-depth review of our operations, including merchandising, policies and procedures, asset protection and safety, human resources. Part-time associates receive structured training as part of their onboarding throughout their first five scheduled shifts. 

Our Ollie&#146;s Leadership Institute (&#147;OLI&#148;) is a program that is used to equip associates with the ability to advance their career. Each OLI participant receives an individual development plan, designed to prepare him or her for his or her next level position. Our strong growth provides opportunities for advancement and OLI is focused on preparing eligible candidates for these positions. OLI is our preferred source for new supervisors and team leaders as &#147;home grown&#148; talent has proven to be successful. Since the program was implemented, our internal promotion rate has increased from 18% in 2009 to approximately 50% in 2015. We believe our training and development programs help create a positive work environment and result in stores that operate at a high level. 

Marketing and advertising 

Our marketing and advertising campaigns feature colorful caricatures and witty sayings in order to make our customers laugh. We believe that by disarming our customers by getting them to giggle a bit, they are able to look at and trust our products for what they are&#151;extremely great bargains. Our distinctive and often self-deprecating humor and highly recognizable caricatures are used in all of our stores, flyers and advertising campaigns. 

&#160;

We tailor our marketing mix and strategy for each market, deal or promotion. We primarily use the following forms of marketing and advertising: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Print and direct mail : During fiscal year 2015, we distributed approximately 400 million highly recognizable flyers. Our flyers serve as the foundation of our marketing strategy and highlight current deals to create shopping urgency and drive traffic and increase frequency of store visits. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Radio and television : We selectively utilize creative radio and television advertising campaigns in targeted markets at certain times of the year, particularly during the holiday sales season to create brand awareness and support new store openings. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sports marketing, charity and community events : We sponsor professional and amateur athletics including Major League Baseball, NASCAR, National Hockey League, NCAA Basketball and Football, as well as various local athletic programs. Additionally, we are dedicated to maintaining a visible presence in the communities in which our stores are located through the sponsorship of charitable organizations such as the Children&#146;s Miracle Network, Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation and the Kevin Harvick Foundation. We believe these sponsorships promote our brand, underscore our values and build a sense of community. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Digital marketing and social media : We maintain an active web presence and promote our brand through our website and social media outlets. We also utilize targeted email marketing to highlight our latest brand name offerings and drive traffic to our stores. Ollie&#146;s Army 

Our customer loyalty program, Ollie&#146;s Army, stands at 6.4 million members as of January 30, 2016 and has increased 32.6% from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015. In fiscal year 2015, Ollie&#146;s Army members accounted for over 60% of net sales and spent approximately 40% more per shopping trip, on average, than non-members. Ollie&#146;s appeals to a broad demographic, spanning a wide range of household incomes with more than 60% of Ollie&#146;s Army members having a household income in excess of $50,000. Consistent with our marketing strategy, we engage new and existing Ollie&#146;s Army members through the use of witty phrases and signage; examples include &#147;Enlist in Ollie&#146;s Army today,&#148; &#147;become one of the few, the cheap, the proud&#148; and &#147;Ollie&#146;s Army Boot Camp&#133;all enlistees will receive 15% off their next purchase.&#148; Ollie&#146;s Army members appreciate our compelling value proposition and are willing to drive upwards of 25 minutes to shop at our stores. Historically, Ollie&#146;s Army members have demonstrated double digit redemption rates for promotional activities exclusive to Ollie&#146;s Army members, such as our Valentine&#146;s, Boot Camp and Buzzard 15% off mailers, as well as Ollie&#146;s Army Night, a special annual one-day after-hours sale in December for Ollie&#146;s Army members. We expect to continue leveraging the data gathered from our proprietary database of Ollie&#146;s Army members to better segment and target our marketing initiatives and increase shopping frequency. 

Competition 

We compete with a diverse group of retailers including discount, closeout, mass merchant, department, grocery, drug, convenience, hardware, variety, online and other specialty stores. 

The principal basis on which we compete against other retailers is by offering an ever changing selection of brand name products at compelling price points in an exciting shopping environment. Accordingly, we compete against a fragmented group of retailers, wholesalers and jobbers to acquire merchandise for sale in our stores. 

Our established relationships with our suppliers coupled with our scale, associated buying power, financial credibility and responsiveness often makes Ollie&#146;s the first call for available deals. Our direct relationships with suppliers have increased as we have grown, and we continuously strive to broaden our supplier network.

Technology 

Our management information systems provide a full range of business process assistance and timely information to support our merchandising team and strategy, management of multiple distribution centers, stores and operations, and financial reporting. We believe our current systems provide us with operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and respond to merchandising and operating trends in our business. We use a combination of internal and external resources to support store point-of-sale, merchandise acquisition and distribution, inventory management, financial reporting, real estate and administrative functions. We continuously assess ways to maximize productivity and efficiency, as well as evaluate opportunities to further enhance our existing systems. Our existing systems are scalable to support future growth. 

Government regulation 

We are subject to labor and employment laws, including minimum wage requirements, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers and/or govern product standards, the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. 

We source a portion of our products from outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our vendor compliance agreements mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations. 

Insurance 

We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers&#146; compensation, general liability, commercial property, ocean marine, cyber, director and officer and employee benefit related insurance policies. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure we maintain adequate levels of coverage.

Our private equity sponsor 

We were acquired by affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC (collectively referred to as &#147;CCMP&#148;) along with certain members of management in September 2012 (the &#147;CCMP Acquisition&#148;). CCMP is a leading global private equity firm specializing in buyout and growth equity investments in companies ranging from $250 million to more than $2 billion in size. CCMP&#146;s founders have invested over $16 billion since 1984, which includes their activities at J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC (a private equity division of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co.) and its predecessor firms. CCMP was formed in August 2006 when the buyout and growth equity investment professionals of J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC separated from JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. to commence operations as an independent firm. The foundation of CCMP&#146;s investment approach is to leverage the combined strengths of its deep industry expertise and proprietary operating resources to create value by investing in four targeted industries&#150; Industrials, Consumer/Retail, Energy and Healthcare.
