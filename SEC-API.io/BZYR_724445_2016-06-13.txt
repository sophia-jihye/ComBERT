 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Burzynski Research Institute, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1984 in order to engage in the research, production, marketing, promotion and sale of certain medical chemical compounds composed of growth-inhibiting peptides, amino acid derivatives and organic acids which are known under the trade name &#147;Antineoplastons.&#148; The Company believes Antineoplastons are useful in the treatment of human cancer and is currently reviewing data of its Phase II clinical trials of Antineoplastons relating to the treatment of various cancers. Antineoplastons have not been approved for sale or use by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;FDA&#148;) or anywhere in the world. In the event Antineoplastons receive such approval and are registered in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, of which there can be no assurance, the Company will commence commercial operations, which shall include the production, marketing, promotion and sale of Antineoplastons in the United States, Canada, or Mexico. In 2004, the FDA approved the designation of Antineoplastons as an &#147;orphan drug&#148; under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983. See &#147; Orphan Drug Designation &#148; below for a detailed description of this designation and its meaning. The Company currently provides Antineoplastons solely for use by Stanislaw R. Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D. (&#147;Dr. Burzynski&#148;) in clinical research. 

&#160; 

The Company has not generated any significant operating revenue since its inception. The Company&#146;s sole source of funding for its operations has been and continues to be payments made by Dr. Burzynski from funds generated from Dr. Burzynski&#146;s medical practice pursuant to various arrangements between the Company and Dr. Burzynski. See &#147; Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence .&#148; The Company reports funds pursuant to such arrangements as additional paid-in capital. See &#147; Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .&#148; The Company does not expect to generate significant operating revenue until such time, if any, as Antineoplastons are approved for use and sale by the FDA. However, the Company may seek additional funding for operations through the sale of its securities. 

&#160; 

Antineoplastons 

&#160; 

Dr. Burzynski commenced his cancer research in 1967 focusing on the isolation of various biochemicals produced by the human body as part of the body&#146;s possible defense against cancer. In the course of his research, Dr. Burzynski identified certain peptides, amino acid derivatives and organic acids in these biochemicals which appear to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. These derivatives were given the name &#147;Antineoplastons&#148; by Dr. Burzynski. 

&#160; 

Antineoplastons are found in the bodily fluids of humans and food and were initially isolated by Dr. Burzynski from normal human blood and urine. Dr. Burzynski believes these substances counteract the development of cancerous growth through a biochemical process which does not inhibit the growth of normal tissues. To date, Dr. Burzynski has developed six formulations of natural Antineoplastons and six synthetic formulations of Antineoplastons. The Phase III clinical trial currently sponsored by the Company (which has not started enrollment) will involve the use of two formulations of synthetic Antineoplastons known as A10 and AS2-1 injections. The Company is also conducting laboratory research involving new generations of Antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160; 

On September 3, 2004, the FDA granted the Company&#146;s request for &#147;orphan drug designation&#148; (&#147;ODD&#148;) for the Company&#146;s Antineoplastons (A10 &#38; AS2-1 Antineoplaston) for treatment for patients with brain stem glioma and, on October 30, 2008, the FDA granted the Company&#146;s request for ODD for Antineoplastons (A10 and AS2-1 Antineoplaston) for the treatment of gliomas. In enacting the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, Congress sought to provide incentives to promote the development of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases. A drug may be considered for orphan drug designation if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States or, even if the drug treats a disease affecting more than 200,000 people in the United States, the drug is not expected to be profitable from sales in the United States. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the first sponsor to obtain FDA marketing approval for a drug with orphan drug designation for the designated disease or condition receives limited marketing exclusivity for seven years; no other sponsor may bring to market the &#147;same drug&#148; for the treatment of the same disease or condition for a period of seven years from the date the application is approved by the FDA. A drug with orphan drug designation must meet the same criteria for safety and efficacy as a drug without orphan drug designation . Please see &#147; Government Regulation &#148; for a description of the regulatory approval process with the FDA and other regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Phase II Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

The Company began Phase II clinical studies in 1994 with four studies. At that time, a number of patients were also receiving Antineoplastons at Dr. Burzynski&#146;s clinic in Houston, Texas (the &#147;Burzynski Clinic&#148;) outside these clinical trials. On February 23, 1996, the FDA requested that all then-current patients of the Burzynski Clinic desiring to continue Antineoplaston treatment be admitted to a Phase II Study, according to Protocol CAN-1. This action resulted in the formation of six cohorts of patients in the CAN-1 study, with the largest group suffering from primary brain tumors. 

&#160; 

The Company received IRB approval on February 4, 2015 for FDA reviewed, open label, phase II study of Antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 in patients with a Diffuse Intrinsic Brainstem Glioma (DIPG) in five treatment groups based on patients age and prior treatment. The first patient was enrolled in April 2016. Currently, the company has one ongoing Phase II clinical trial and the Phase III clinical trial has not yet started enrollment. 

&#160; 

All Phase II clinical trials were for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers using only a combination of Antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1. Most of the trials involve the use of intravenous formulations of Antineoplastons; however, a few trials use oral formulations. Dr. Burzynski acts as principal investigator for all clinical trials pursuant to a Royalty Agreement between the Company and Dr. Burzynski. See &#147; Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence .&#148; All of the clinical trials were conducted at the Burzynski Clinic. Each trial provided for the admission of up to 40 patients, except the CAN-1 study, in which 133 patients were enrolled. 

&#160; 

Fourteen publications by Burzynski Clinic resulting from the trials have been published in peer-reviewed medical journals: (1) Burzynski, S.R., Janicki, T.J., Burzynski, G.S.

One additional publication has been published in 2015 by Kurume University Medical Center in Japan: (15) Ogata, Y., Matono K., Tsuda, H., Ushijima, M., Uchida, S., Akagi, Y., Shirouzu, K. Randomized Phase II Study of 5-Fluorouracil Hepatic Arterial Infusion with or without Antineoplastons as an Adjuvant Therapy after Hepatectomy for Liver Metastases from Colorectal Cancer.

&#160; 

Prior to approving a New Drug Application (&#147;NDA&#148;), the FDA requires that a drug&#146;s safety and efficacy be demonstrated in &#147;well-controlled&#148; clinical trials. The efficacy of the Company&#146;s trials is determined by the protocol specified endpoint of &#147;objective response&#148; (i.e., significant shrinkage or disappearance of the tumor). Several types of controls are acceptable to the FDA. One of these is a &#147;Historic Control.&#148; Under a Historic Control if the course of a disease is well-known, the response of patients taking a drug can be compared to a historic group of patients with that disease. For example, it is known that the tumors of patients suffering from primary malignant brain tumors (&#147;PMBT&#148;) will continue to grow, eventually causing the patient&#146;s death. If a drug is administered to a patient with PMBT and the tumors of the patient disappear or shrink significantly, an assumption is made that there has been a 

&#160; 

&#160; 

response to the drug. The results of other clinical trials conducted or published when the Company&#146;s protocol were active are used by us as historical control. 

&#160; 

All of the Company&#146;s clinical trials, except one, involve the use of Historic Controls. Further, all trials except the CAN-1 study are &#147;prospective clinical trials&#148; (&#147;PCT&#148;). A PCT is a clinical trial wherein patients are accrued into and follow the clinical trial protocol from the very beginning of the trial. A retrospective trial is a trial in which data from patients treated prior to the start of a clinical trial is considered. Results of retrospective trials are, in most instances, not acceptable to the FDA. In addition, there are no clinical trials being conducted that involve &#147;double blind&#148; studies and all but one clinical trial involve no randomization into multiple treatment groups. 

&#160; 

The ultimate goal of any treatment for cancer is patient survival. However, the FDA has determined that requiring exhaustive data showing improved patient survival may unnecessarily delay the approval of new cancer drugs. For that reason, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint (&#147;Milestone&#148;) that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Each of the Company&#146;s Phase II trials describes such Milestones which are used to determine success or failure of the treatment employed. In most of the trials, the Milestones are radiographic evidence of tumor shrinkage by X-ray, computer aided tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Where appropriate, tumor markers such as Prostate Specific Antigen, blood counts, or bone marrow biopsy are used in order to assess a tumor&#146;s growth. 

&#160; 

Where tumor size is used as the Milestone, each clinical trial protocol describes a &#147;complete response&#148; as a complete disappearance of all tumors with no recurrence of tumors for at least four weeks. A &#147;partial response&#148; is described as at least a 50% reduction in total tumor size, with such reduction lasting at least four weeks. An &#147;objective response&#148; is described as either a complete or partial response for protocols BT-06, BT-07, BT-08, BT-09, BT-10, BT-11, BT-12, BT-13, BT-15, BT-18, BT-21, BT-22 and BT-23. &#147;Stable disease&#148; is described as less than 50% reduction in size but no more than 25% increase in size of the tumor mass lasting for at least twelve weeks and 50% increase in CAN-1 protocol. 

&#160; 

The protocols of the Company&#146;s clinical trials involve a two-stage design, wherein the first stage proceeds until the Company admits 20 patients into the trial. After a specified time period, if there were zero responses by the first 20 patients, the trial would be discontinued and the drug declared to have less than desired activity. If there was at least one response, the trial would be continued until forty patients had been accrued. If the study continued, the following conclusions according to protocols based on 40 patients can be made: If there were three or fewer responses, then there is less than desired activity. If there were four or more responses, then there was sufficient evidence to conclude that the Antineoplaston regimen used showed beneficial activity.

&#160; 

The Phase II Study according to Protocol CAN-1 included 35 evaluable brain tumor patients. Complete and partial responses were obtained in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, mixed glioma, medulloblastoma, and malignant meningioma. The treatment with Antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 resulted in 17 (48.6%) cases of objective responses and 11 (31.4%) cases of stable disease defined as less than 50% reduction, or less than 50% increase in size of the tumor mass, lasting for at least 12 weeks. The largest group of evaluable patients involved in the study had glioblastoma multiforme. Six of the cases were classified as complete and partial responses, four obtained stabilization and four developed progression of the disease. 

&#160; 

Of the 2,298 patients who have received at least one dose of Antineoplastons, the serious adverse events (SAEs) which have been experienced are as follows: hemoglobin (grade 3: 3 patients; grade 4: 1 patient), extravasation (grade 3: 1 patient), pain related to the central venous catheter (grade 3: 1 patient), fatigue (grade 3: 2 patients; grade 4: 1 patient), fever (grade 3: 2 patients), injection site reaction (grade 3: 1 patient), vomiting (grade 3: 2 patients), hypernatremia (grade 3: 2 patients; grade 4: 28 patients; grade 5: 6 patients-not confirmed by autopsy), confusion (grade 3: 1 patient), seizure (grade 3: 1 patient), somnolence (grade 3: 8 patients; grade 4: 1 patient), pain: head/headache (grade 3: 2 patients) and pain: joint (grade 3: 1 patient). 491 out of 2,298 patients experienced hypernatremia that was possibly related to the study drug, regardless of severity. 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the response results of the trials that have reached a Milestone, management believes it is likely that the FDA may require additional clinical trials based upon such protocols to be conducted by an institution not affiliated with the Company or Dr. Burzynski before advising that an NDA filing is warranted. In addition, the FDA has indicated it will not accept the efficacy data, but will accept toxicity data generated by the Phase II study according to Protocol CAN-1 because the trial was partially retrospective. At this time, the Company cannot predict if and/or when it will submit an NDA to the FDA, nor can the Company estimate the number or type of additional trials the FDA may require. Further, there can be no assurance that an NDA for Antineoplastons, as a treatment for cancer, will ever be approved by the FDA. 

&#160; 

No assurance can be given that any new IND for clinical tests on humans will be approved by the FDA for human clinical trials on cancer or other diseases, that the results of such human clinical trials will prove that Antineoplastons are safe or effective in the treatment of cancer or other diseases, or that the FDA would approve the sale of Antineoplastons in the United States. 

&#160; 

Phase III Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

On January 13, 2009, the Company announced that it reached an agreement with the FDA that enabled the Company to move forward immediately with a pivotal Phase III clinical trial of combination Antineoplaston therapy plus radiation therapy in patients with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic brainstem glioma. The agreement was made under the FDA&#146;s Special Protocol Assessment procedure and means that the design and planned analysis of the Phase III study is acceptable to support a regulatory submission seeking new drug approval. However, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on IND 43,742 regarding such Phase III clinical trial. 

&#160; 

The partial clinical hold was lifted by FDA on June 20, 2014 for protocol BT-52 and the FDA concluded that Phase III protocol BT-52 may be initiated as well. Please see the section below entitled &#147;Partial Clinical Hold on Phase II and Phase III Clinical Trials.&#148; The study&#146;s objective is to compare overall survival of children with newly-diagnosed, diffuse, intrinsic brainstem glioma (DBSG) who receive combination Antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 plus RT versus RT alone. 

&#160; 

Partial Clinical Hold on Phase II and Phase III Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

In a letter dated June 25, 2012, the Company informed the FDA of a serious adverse event in which a patient who was receiving Antineoplastons developed grade 4 hypernatremia and subsequently died. The Antineoplaston-related hypernatremia was categorized by the investigator as possibly related to the study drug. Of the 2298 patients who have received at least one dose of Antineoplastons, the serious adverse events (SAEs) which have been experienced are as follows: hemoglobin (grade 3: 0.13%; grade 4: 0.04%), extravasation (grade 3: 0.04%), pain (grade 3: 0.04%), fatigue (grade 3: 0.09%; grade 4: 0.04%), fever (grade 3: 0.09%), injection site reaction (grade 3: 0.04%), vomiting (grade 3: 0.09%), hypernatremia (grade 3: 0.09%; grade 4: 1.12%; grade 5: 0.26%), confusion (grade 3: 0.04%), seizure (grade 3: 0.04%), somnolence (grade 3: 0.35%; grade 4: 0.04%), pain: head/headache (grade 3: 0.09%) and pain: joint (grade 3: 0.04%). 

&#160; 

On July 30, 2012, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold for enrollment of new pediatric patients under single patient protocols or in any of the active Phase II or Phase III studies under investigational new drug application (&#147;IND&#148;) 43,742. The FDA imposed this partial clinical hold because, according to the FDA, insufficient information had been submitted by the Company to allow the FDA to determine whether the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of treatment use, and that the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated. The FDA cited 21 C.F.R. &#167; 312.42(b)(2)(i), 21 C.F.R. &#167; 312.42(b)(1)(iv), and 21 C.F.R. &#167; 312.42(b)(3)(i), as grounds for imposition of a clinical hold; and 21 C.F.R. &#167; 312.305(a)(2), a criteria for expanded access use. The FDA advised the Company that until it resolved the matter to FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the Company could not enroll new pediatric patients in any protocol under such IND. The Company later notified the FDA in a 

&#160; 

&#160; 

September 24, 2012 letter that it was closing pediatric protocol BT-10 (under IND 43,742) for enrollment effective September 25, 2012, and that it would also terminate the protocol once all active patients had completed the study. As of February 17, 2015, all patients discontinued treatment under protocol BT-10 and such protocol was closed as of March 10, 2015. 

&#160; 

In a teleconference on January 9, 2013 between the FDA and the Company, followed by a letter of the same date, the FDA notified the Company that the agency was placing IND 43,742 on partial clinical hold, due to a lack of a complete response to the issues raised by the FDA and what the FDA deemed a misleading, erroneous, and incomplete investigator brochure. The FDA cited 21 C.F.R. &#167; 312.42(b)(2)(i) and 21 C.F.R. &#167; 312.42(b)(1)(iii), as grounds for imposition of a clinical hold. The FDA further advised the Company that until it resolved the matter to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, that the Company could not enroll new adult or pediatric patients in any protocol under such IND. The FDA also placed protocol BT-52 on clinical hold due to what the FDA deemed to be an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury to human subjects. The FDA cited 21 C.F.R. &#167; 312.42(b)(2)(i) and 21 C.F.R.&#167; 312.42(B)(1)(i), as grounds for imposition of a clinical hold. The FDA advised the Company that until it resolved the matter to FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the Company could not legally conduct the identified clinical study under such IND. In a teleconference with the FDA on September 16, 2013 and pursuant to the Company&#146;s notification letter dated September 17, 2013, the Company notified the FDA that the proposed Phase III protocol BT-54 had been withdrawn from further consideration. 

&#160; 

After several amendments to the IND which were reviewed by the FDA, the FDA concluded that BT-52 can be initiated and partial clinical hold was removed by the FDA on June 20, 2014. 

&#160; 

Additionally, the Company received IRB approval on February 4, 2015 for FDA reviewed, open label, phase II study of Antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 in patients with a Diffuse Intrinsic Brainstem Glioma (DIPG) in five treatment groups based on patients age and prior treatment. The first patient was enrolled in April 2016. 

&#160; 

Complaint Filed by the Texas Medical Board Against Dr. Burzynski 

&#160; 

In July 2014 and November 2014, the Texas Medical Board amended its complaint filed in January 2014 against Dr. Stanislaw R. Burzynski, who serves as our President and the Chairman of our Board of Directors. The Texas Medical Board made several new allegations that Dr. Burzynski had acted unprofessionally and failed to meet standards of care under the state&#146;s medical practice act. Dr. Burzynski believes the allegations are without merit and intends to defend himself vigorously. The State Office of Administrative Hearings heard the matter in November 2015 and January 2016 but has not yet made a ruling. If an adverse outcome in the proceedings against Dr. Burzynski occurs, this may result in substantial harm to the Company and our business operations. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The FDA imposes substantial requirements upon, and conditions precedent to, the introduction of therapeutic drug products to the marketplace. Seeking marketing authorization for a new drug is a lengthy, complex, and costly process. To seek FDA approval for Antineoplastons, the Company must first complete extensive preclinical and clinical research, and submit data from this research and supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the use of Antineoplastons for the indication sought meets the statutory standards for safety and effectiveness, manufacturing and controls, and labeling. 

&#160; 

The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies. Additional government regulation may be established that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of Antineoplastons. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the Company can satisfy FDA requirements to gain approval for Antineoplastons in the United States or that FDA approval for the sale of Antineoplastons in the United States will be obtained. If regulatory approval is granted, the approval may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for which Antineoplastons may be marketed. 

&#160; 

The effect of the FDA drug approval process for Antineoplastons may impose costly procedures upon the Company&#146;s activities which may furnish a competitive advantage to the other companies that compete with the Company in the field of cancer treatment drugs. The extent of potentially adverse government regulations which might arise from future legislation or administrative action cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

The Investigational New Drug Application Process in the United States is governed by regulations established by the FDA which strictly control the use and distribution of investigational drugs in the United States. The guidelines require that an IND, filed by a sponsor, contain sufficient information to justify administering the drug to humans, that the application include relevant information on the chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of the drug derived from chemical, laboratory and animal or in vitro testing, and that a protocol be provided for the initial study of the new drug to be conducted on humans. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In order to conduct a clinical trial of a new drug on humans, a sponsor must prepare and submit to the FDA a comprehensive IND. Such application must contain an investigator&#146;s brochure, a description of the composition, manufacture and control of the drug substance and the drug product, sufficient information to assure the proper identification, quality, purity and strength of the investigational drug, a description of the drug substance, including its physical, chemical, and biological characteristics, the general method of preparation of the drug substance, a list of all components including interactive ingredients, adequate information about pharmacological and toxicological studies of the drug involving laboratory animals or in vitro tests on the basis of which the sponsor has concluded that it is reasonably safe to conduct the proposed clinical investigation and a summary of any previous human experience with the drug. Where there has been widespread use of the drug outside of the United States or otherwise, it is possible in some limited circumstances to use well-documented clinical experience in place of some other pre-clinical work. 

&#160; 

The focal point of the IND is on the general investigational plan and the protocols for specific human studies. The sponsor of the study is subject to numerous requirements for the proper conduct and oversight of the study, including the protection of human subjects. The plan is carried out in three phases, and earlier phase trials are not necessarily predictive of results in later clinical trials. Phase I includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. The studies are closely monitored to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans and the potential side effects and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase I testing, sufficient information about the drug is gathered to design well-controlled, scientifically valid Phase II studies. Phase II includes controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase II studies are controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. Phase III includes expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III studies usually include anywhere from several hundred to several thousand subjects. 

&#160; 

An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. After the IND becomes effective, the investigation is permitted to proceed, during which the sponsor must keep the FDA informed of new studies, including animal studies, make progress reports on the study or studies covered by the IND, and also be responsible for informing FDA and clinical investigators immediately of unforeseen serious side effects or injuries. There can be no assurance that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing will be completed successfully by the Company within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, the Company or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

&#160; 

Assuming successful completion of the clinical studies, the results of the studies, together with other detailed information, including, among other information, details concerning the manufacture and composition of the drug, proposed labeling, environmental impact and the scientific rationale for the drug, its intended use and the potential benefits of the drug product are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug. If the FDA finds the NDA submission and the manufacturing process to be acceptable and to meet the criteria for approval, the FDA will issue an approval letter. If the FDA determines that an NDA cannot be approved as submitted, it will send the applicant a &#147;Complete Response&#148; letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete, that the application is not ready for approval, and to describe specific deficiencies. In addition to the postmarketing requirements that apply to all marketed drugs, the FDA may impose, as a condition of approval, postmarketing requirements such as postmarketing study commitments, or other limitations or restrictions. Product approvals may be withdrawn by the FDA, following notice of opportunity for a hearing if problems concerning safety or efficacy of a drug or the sponsor&#146;s compliance with regulatory requirements. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s use of Milestones to predict the benefits of Antineoplastons is relevant to the FDA approval process. If surrogate endpoints are used, for regular approval (i.e., the longstanding FDA route of drug approval based on the demonstration of clinical benefit) an applicant must show direct evidence of clinical benefit or improvement in an established surrogate for clinical benefit. For &#147;accelerated approval,&#148; a process potentially available for pharmaceutical agents that treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions, surrogate endpoints must be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. When appropriate, the Company intends to pursue opportunities for accelerated review of its products. However, the Company has not yet received any accelerated approvals for any of the Company&#146;s product candidates. The Company cannot predict the ultimate effect of this review process on the timing or likelihood of FDA review of any of its products. Adequacy as a surrogate endpoint for regular or accelerated approval is highly dependent upon a variety of factors including effect size, effect duration, and benefits of other available therapy. 

&#160; 

A drug&#146;s approval under the accelerated approval regulations is conditioned on the conduct of postapproval clinical studies to verify and describe the actual clinical benefit. Further, the FDA may also impose postmarketing restrictions to assure safe use of a drug product that was subject to accelerated approval. For drugs approved under FDA&#146;s accelerated procedures, the FDA may withdraw approval of the drug on an expedited basis if the applicant fails to perform the required postmarketing study with due 

&#160; 

&#160; 

diligence, use of the drugs demonstrates that post-marketing restrictions are inadequate to assure safe use of the drug, the applicant fails to adhere to the postmarketing restrictions agreed upon, the promotional materials are false or misleading, or other evidence demonstrates that the drug is not shown to be safe or effective under its conditions of use. 

&#160; 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted for any product or that approval will be granted according to any schedule. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a drug is granted, the approval will be limited to specific indications. There can be no assurance that any of the Company&#146;s product candidates will receive regulatory approvals for commercialization. 

&#160; 

Please see &#147; Orphan Drug Designation &#148; for a description of the FDA&#146;s orphan drug designation under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 as it applies to the Company&#146;s Antineoplastons. 

&#160; 

Even if the regulatory approvals for the Company&#146;s products are obtained, its products and its manufacturing facility are subject to ongoing compliance obligations. The FDA will require postmarketing monitoring and reporting related to the safety of the Company&#146;s products. The Company&#146;s drug manufacturing facility, and the facility of any third-party contracted to manufacture the products, must comply with the FDA&#146;s current good manufacturing practice (&#147;GMP&#148;) regulations, which are strictly enforced. Manufacturing facilities will be subject to periodic inspection by FDA. Full technical compliance requires manufacturers to expend funds, time and effort in the area of production and quality control. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval or failure to comply with applicable FDA or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement actions and restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including warning letters, suspension of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, delays in obtaining new product approvals, withdrawal of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of the Company&#146;s products under development or impose additional compliance obligations before or after approval. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. Although the Company believes its procedures for handling and disposing of those materials comply with state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident of this type occurs, the Company could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be material to its financial condition and business. The Company is also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling of biohazardous materials. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the Company may be adopted in the future. Any violation of these laws and regulations, and the cost of compliance, could materially and adversely affect the Company. The Company has historically spent approximately $40,000 per year on environmental compliance matters. For the year ended February 29, 2016, the Company spent approximately $5,000 on environmental compliance matters. The Company expects to spend approximately $10,000 for repairs and upgrades during the fiscal year ending February 28, 2017. 

&#160; 

Government Notices and Regulations 

&#160; 

On March 15, 2013, the Company received a Notice of Inspectional Observations (FDA Form 483) from the FDA. During an inspection, the FDA observed (1) failure to monitor the progress of an investigation conducted under the IND and (2) failure to obtain from an investigator sufficient financial information to allow complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements. In response to the observations, the Company provided explanation as to the nature of monitoring procedures, initiated new monitoring practices (effective May 2013) engaging scientifically qualified individuals to conduct Good Clinical Practice (GCP) monitoring and project management, initiated a process to collect financial disclosure information from sub-investigators and amended protocols to reflect current understanding of response criteria. 

&#160; 

On December 3, 2013, the Company received a Warning Letter from the FDA. The FDA noted concerns regarding the (1) failure to ensure proper monitoring of the investigations and failure to ensure that the investigations are conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND; and (2) failure to obtain from an investigator sufficient financial information to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements. In order to address the FDA concerns, the Company provided information regarding ongoing review of patient information, agreed to submit protocol amendments to reflect current standard of practice for corticosteroid use, separated monitoring activities between the Company and the Burzynski Clinic, revised the informed consent and checklist, and updated financial disclosures. 

&#160; 

No delays or other adverse impacts to the clinical program in general are expected . The Company received IRB approval on February 4, 2015 for FDA reviewed, open label, phase II study of Antineoplaston A10 and AS2-1 in patients with a Diffuse Intrinsic Brainstem Glioma (DIPG) in five treatment groups based on patients age and prior treatment. The first patient was enrolled in April 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Phase 3 clinical trial will commence upon availability of funds. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s principal research and development efforts currently focus on Antineoplastons. The anticancer activity of these compounds has been documented in preclinical studies employing the methods of cell culture, pharmacology, cell biology, molecular biology, experimental therapeutics and animal models of cancer. At the level of Phase II clinical studies, the Company believes the anticancer activity of Antineoplastons is supported by preliminary results from FDA-authorized, Phase II clinical trials. 

&#160; 

The cellular mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of Antineoplastons continues to be investigated in both the Company&#146;s own basic preclinical research program and in independent laboratories around the world. A review of this work suggests several mechanisms that may underlie the antineoplastic activity of Antineoplastons. For example, it has been found, in cell culture experiments, that Antineoplastons induce pathologically undifferentiated cancer cells to assume a more normal state of differentiation. Cell culture experiments have also shown that Antineoplaston components can kill some cancer cells by activating the cell&#146;s intrinsic &#147;suicide&#148; program. It must be noted that data collected in cell culture experiments may or may not indicate the mechanism of action of Antineoplastons in humans. 

&#160; 

At a more molecular or sub-cellular level, cell culture experiments have shown that Antineoplastons can block biochemical pathways involving oncogenes required to produce abnormal cell growth. In addition, cell culture experiments have shown that Antineoplastons can increase the expression of anticancer tumor suppressor genes. Although these experiments were conducted using human cancer cells, they may or may not indicate the mechanism of Antineoplaston action in humans. 

&#160; 

In addition to the original family of Antineoplaston compounds (the &#147;Parental Generation&#148;), the Company continues its development of a second generation of Antineoplastons. In cell culture experiments, the second generation Antineoplastons, which were developed by the Company, have been shown to be significantly more potent than the Parental Generation. 

&#160; 

The Company is also developing a third generation of structurally altered Antineoplastons that the Company believes will exhibit markedly improved anticancer activity in human cancer cell lines that have been resistant to the Parental Generation. However, increases of antineoplastic activity in cell culture experiments may or may not translate into increased efficacy in humans. 

&#160; 

The Company is also involved in ongoing studies examining the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) and pharmacodynamics (dose-response) of Antineoplastons in patients with neoplastic disease. 

&#160; 

The Company uses various scientific reagents from several different suppliers to conduct its research activities. 

&#160; 

Total research and development costs for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2015 were approximately $1,847,000 and $2,709,000, respectively. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Since 1984, eight patents involving the formulation, preparation, manufacture, production, use, dosage and treatment of cancer with Antineoplastons (the &#147;Patents&#148;) have been issued to Dr. Burzynski by the United States Patent Office and the Patent Offices of 34 other countries. The Patents for cancer treatment and diagnosis in the United States and Canada are licensed to the Company pursuant to a License Agreement dated June 29, 1983, as superseded by an Amended License Agreement dated April 24, 1989 and a Second Amended License Agreement dated March 1, 1990 (collectively, the &#147;License Agreement&#148;). Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company holds an exclusive right in the United States, Canada, and Mexico (the &#147;Territory&#148;) to use, manufacture, develop, sell, distribute, sub-license and otherwise exploit all of Dr. Burzynski&#146;s rights, title, and interests, including patent rights, in Antineoplastons in the treatment and diagnosis of cancer. See &#147; Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. &#148; The Company will not be able to exploit such rights until such time as Antineoplastons are approved, of which there can be no assurance, by the FDA for sale in the United States. The License Agreement is to continue in effect until the expiration of the last Patent that was licensed under the agreement or termination pursuant to certain other provisions. The Company and Dr. Burzynski also entered into a Royalty Agreement, dated March 25, 1997, and a First Amended Royalty Agreement, dated September 29, 1997 (collectively, the &#147;Royalty Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which Dr. Burzynski will receive a royalty interest from all future sales, distribution, and manufacture of Antineoplastons by the Company. The Company owns, pursuant to the License Agreement, exclusive rights to eight issued United States Patents, four issued Canadian Patents and one issued Mexican Patent. 

&#160; 

The five initial United States Patents (the &#147;Initial Patents&#148;) relate to: (i) Determination of Antineoplastons in body tissue or fluids as a testing procedure to aid in the diagnosis of cancer; (ii) Processes for the preparation of purified fractions of Antineoplastons from human urine; (iii) Processes for the synthetic production of Antineoplastons and methods of treating neoplastic disease (cancer); 

&#160; 

&#160; 

(iv) Administration of Antineoplastons to humans; and (v) Methods of synthesizing A-10. The last of the Initial Patents expired on January 11, 2009, however, the Company does not believe the expiration of any of the Initial Patents will have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

&#160; 

The sixth United States Patent (the &#147;2000 U.S. Patent&#148;) covers Liposomal Antineoplaston therapies with markedly improved anticancer activity. The 2000 U.S. Patent expires on May 14, 2017. 

&#160; 

The seventh United States Patent (the &#147;2001 U.S. Patent&#148;) is for a treatment regimen for the administration of phenylacetylglutamine, phenylacetylisoglutamine, and/or phenylacetate. The 2001 U.S. Patent expires on July 23, 2018. 

&#160; 

The eighth United States Patent (the &#147;2005 U.S. Patent&#148;) relates to a divisional application to the 2001 U.S. Patent. The 2005 U.S. Patent will expire July 31, 2018. 

&#160; 

The four Canadian Patents (the &#147;Canadian Patents&#148;) relate to: (i) Processes for the preparation of purified fractions of Antineoplastons from human urine, (ii) Processes for the synthetic production of Antineoplastons and methods of treating neoplastic disease (cancer), (iii) Liposomal formulation of Antineoplastons and (iv) Treatment regimen for the administration of phenylacetylglutamine. The Canadian Patents expired or will expire on June 4, 2002, November 14, 2006, May 14, 2017 and July 2, 2019, respectively; however, the Company does not believe the expiration of the Canadian Patents will have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

&#160; 

The Mexican Patent relates to a treatment regimen for the administration of phenylacetylglutamine. This patent will expire in the year 2019. 

&#160; 

The Company also depends upon unpatented proprietary technology, and may determine in appropriate circumstances that its interest would be better served by reliance upon trade secrets or confidentiality agreements rather than patents. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s success will depend in part on its ability to enforce patent protection for its products, preserve its trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through development and regulatory approval to the marketplace, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. There can be no assurance that the Company will develop additional products and methods that are patentable or that present or future patents will provide sufficient protection to the Company&#146;s present or future technologies, products and processes. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, design around the Company&#146;s patents or obtain access to the Company&#146;s know-how or that others will not successfully challenge the validity of the Company&#146;s patents or be issued patents which may prevent the sale of one or more of the Company&#146;s product candidates, or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties by the Company to third parties in order to enable the Company to conduct its business. Legal standards relating to the scope of claims and the validity of patents in the fields in which the Company is pursuing research and development are still evolving, are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues. No assurance can be given as to the degree of protection or competitive advantage any patents issued to the Company will afford, the validity of any such patents or the Company&#146;s ability to avoid violating or infringing any patents issued to others. Further, there can be no guarantee that any patents issued to or licensed by the Company will not be infringed upon by the products of others. Litigation and other proceedings involving the defense and prosecution of patent claims can be expensive and time consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to the Company, and can result in the diversion of resources from the Company&#146;s other activities. An adverse outcome could subject the Company to significant liabilities to third parties, require the Company to obtain licenses from third parties or require the Company to cease any related research and development activities or sales. 

&#160; 

The Company depends upon the knowledge, experience and skills (which are not patentable) of its key scientific and technical personnel. To protect its rights to its proprietary information, the Company requires all employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside the Company and require disclosure and assignment to the Company of their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. There can be no assurance that these agreements will effectively prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company&#146;s confidential information. 

&#160; 

ANTINEOPLASTON &#174; is a trademark registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

There are many companies, universities, research teams and scientists, both private and government-sponsored, that are engaged in research to produce cancer treatment agents and that have greater financial resources and larger research staffs and facilities than the Company. In addition, there are other companies and entities, both private and government-sponsored, that are engaged in research aimed at compounds similar or related to the Company&#146;s Antineoplastons. To the extent that the United States Government also conducts research or supports other companies or individuals in their research, such companies or individuals may have a competitive advantage over the Company. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of February 29, 2016, the Company had no full-time employee.
