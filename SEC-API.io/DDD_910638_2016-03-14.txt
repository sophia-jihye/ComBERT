These suppliers also carry out quality control procedures on our printers prior to their shipment to customers. As part of these activities, these suppliers have responsibility for procuring the components and sub-assemblies either from us or third party suppliers . We purchase finished printers from these suppliers pursuant to forecasts and customer orders that we supply to them. While the outsourced suppliers of our printers have responsibility for the supply chain and inventory of components for the printers they assemble, the components, parts and sub-assemblies that are used in our printers are generally available from several potential suppliers. 

&#160; 

We produce print materials at our facilities in Barberton, Ohio; Marly and Gr&#252;ningen , Switzerland and Rock Hill, South Carolina. We also have arrangements with third parties who blend certain print materials according to our specifications that we sell under our own brand names, and we purchase certain print materials from third parties for resale to our customers . 

&#160; 

Our equipment assembly and print materials blending activities , on-demand parts services and certain research and development activities are subject to compliance with applicable federal, state and local provisions regulating the storage, use and discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that we are in compliance , in all material respects, with such regulations as currently in effect and that continued compliance with them will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or consolidated financial position. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

The 3D printing industry continues to experience technological change and developments in hardware, software and materials. Consequently, we have ongoing research and development programs to develop new products and to enhance our portfolio of products and services, as well as to improve and expand the capabilities of our 3D printers and platforms, materials, software and other products. Our efforts are often augmented by development arrangements with research institutions, customers, suppliers, and assembly and design firms that we have engaged to produce our printers. From time to time, we also engage third - party engineering companies and specialty print materials companies in specific development projects. 

&#160;

In addition to our internally developed technology platforms, we have acquired products or technologies developed by others by acquiring business entities that held ownership rights to the technologies. In other instances , we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property rights of technologies developed by third parties through agreements that may obligate us to pay a license fee or royalty, typically based upon a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by such products. As noted below, the amount of such royalties was not material to our results of operations or consolidated financial position for the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

Research and development expenses were $92.8 million, $75.4 million and $ 43.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 201 3 , respectively. 

&#160; 

No software development costs from acquisitions were capitalized in 2015 or 2014. We capitalized $ 0.3 million of software development costs from acquisitions in 2013 . &#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We regard our technology platforms and materials as proprietary and seek to protect them through copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. At December 31, 20 15 and 2014, we held 1,114 &#160; and 1,061 patents worldwide , respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had 264 and &#160; 262 pending patent applications worldwide , respectively; including applications covering inventions contained in our recently introduced printers and demonstrated technologies . &#160; The principal issued patents covering aspects of our various technologies &#160; will expire &#160; at varying times through the year &#160; 2027 . 

&#160; 

We are a party to various licenses that have had the effect of broadening the range of the patents, patent applications and other intellectual property available to us. 

&#160; 

We have also entered into licensing or cross-licensing arrangements with various compa nies in the United States and other countries that enable those companies to utilize our technolog ies in their products or that enable us to use their technologies in our products. Under certain of these licenses, we are entitled to receive, or we are obligated to pay, royalties for the sale of licensed products in the U.S. or in other countries. The amount of such royalties was not material to our results of operations or consolidated financial position for the three-year period ended December 31, 20 15 . 

&#160; 

We believe that, while our patents and licenses provide us with a competitive advantage, our success also depends on our marketing, business development, applications know-how and on our ongoing research and development efforts. Accordingly, we believe the expiration of any of the patents, patent applications or licenses discussed above would not be material to our business or financial position . 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face competition from the development of new technologies or techniques not encompassed by the patents that we own or license and from conventional technologies. 

&#160; 

Our competitors also include other suppliers of 3D printers and materials, design and production software, tools and scanners, as well as suppliers of forming manufacturing solutions such as vacuum casting equipment, and suppliers of healthcare simulators. Numerous suppliers of these products operate both internationally and regionally, and many of them have well-recognized product lines that compete with us in a wide range of our product applications . 

&#160; 

Competition for most of our 3D printers is based primarily on technology capabilities, process know-how, product application know-how and the ability to provide a full range of products and services to meet customer needs. Accordingly, our ongoing research and development programs are intended to enable us to maintain technological leadership. Certain of the companies providing competing products or services, and those currently developing 3D printing products and services, are well established and may have greater financial resources than us. 

&#160; 

Our competitors are also companies that manufacture machines that are used to make models, prototypes, molds and parts. These competitors include suppliers of CNC machines, plastics molding equipment, including injection-molding equipment, traditional machining, milling and grinding equipment, and businesses that use such equipment to produce models, prototypes, and molds and manufacture parts. These conventional machining, plastic molding and metal casting techniques continue to be the most common methods by which plastic and metal parts and tool inserts are manufactured today. 

&#160;

We believe that our future success depends on our ability to provide high quality products and services, enhance our existing portfolio, introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, extend our core technologies to new applications and anticipate and respond to emerging standards, business models, service delivery methods and other technological changes . 

&#160; 

Employee s 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 and 20 14 , we had 2,492 and &#160; 2,136 f ull-time employees , respectively . A lthough some of our employees outside the U.S. are subject to local statutory employment and labor arrangements , n one of our &#160; U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any material work stoppages and believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
