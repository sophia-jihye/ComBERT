 ITEM 1. &#32; BUSINESS 

As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended &#32; December 31, 2015 , the terms "ACCO Brands," "ACCO," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to ACCO Brands Corporation, a Delaware corporation incorporated in 2005, and its consolidated domestic and international subsidiaries. &#32; 

Overview of the Company &#32; 

ACCO Brands is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of office, school and calendar products and select computer and electronic accessories. More than 80% of our net sales come from brands that occupy the number one or number two positions in the select markets in which we compete. We seek to develop new products that meet the needs of our consumers and commercial end-users. We compete through a balance of product innovation, category management, a low-cost operating model and an efficient supply chain. We sell our products to consumers and commercial end-users primarily through resellers, including traditional office supply resellers, wholesalers and retailers, including on-line retailers. Our products are sold primarily to markets located in the U.S., Northern Europe, Brazil, Canada, Australia and Mexico. &#32;For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 40% &#32;of our sales were outside the U.S. 

The majority of our revenue is concentrated in geographies where demand for our product categories is in mature stages, but we see opportunities to grow sales through share gains, channel expansion and new products. Over the long-term we expect to derive growth in faster growing emerging geographies where demand in the product categories in which we compete is strong, such as in Latin America and parts of Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. We plan to grow organically supplemented by strategic acquisitions in both existing and adjacent categories. Historically, key drivers of demand for office and school products have included trends in white-collar employment levels, education enrollment levels, gross domestic product (GDP), growth in the number of small businesses and home offices, as well as consumer usage trends for our product categories. 

We believe our leading product positions provide the scale to enable us to invest in product innovation and drive growth across our product categories. We currently manufacture approximately half of our products locally where we operate, and source approximately half of our products, primarily from China. &#32; 

On May 1, 2012, we completed the merger (the "Merger") of the Mead Consumer and Office Products Business ("Mead C&#38;OP") with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. &#32; 

Reportable Segments &#32; 

The Company's three business segments are described below. &#32; 

ACCO Brands North America and ACCO Brands International 

ACCO Brands North America and ACCO Brands International manufacture, source and sell traditional office products, school supplies and calendar products. ACCO Brands North America comprises the U.S. and Canada, and ACCO Brands International comprises the rest of the world, primarily Northern Europe, Brazil, Australia and Mexico. 

Our office, school and calendar product lines use name brands such as AT-A-GLANCE &#174; , Day-Timer &#174; , Five Star &#174; , GBC &#174; , Hilroy, Marbig, Mead &#174; , NOBO, Quartet &#174; , Rexel, Swingline &#174; , Tilibra, Wilson Jones &#174; &#32;and many others. Products and brands are not confined to one channel or product category and are sold based on end-user preference in each geographic location. &#32; 

The majority of our office products, such as stapling, binding and laminating equipment and related consumable supplies, shredders and whiteboards, are used by businesses. Most of these end-users purchase their products from our customers, which include traditional office supply resellers, wholesalers and other retailers, including on-line retailers. We also supply some of our products directly to large commercial and industrial end-users, and provide business machine maintenance and certain repair services. Additionally, we also supply private label products within the office products sector. &#32; 

Our school products include notebooks, folders, decorative calendars and stationery products. We distribute our school products primarily through mass merchandisers, and other retailers, such as grocery, drug and office superstores as well as on-line retailers. We also supply private label products within the school products sector. &#32; 

Our calendar products are sold through all the same channels where we sell office or school products, as well as directly to consumers both on-line and through direct mail. 

Our customers are primarily large global and regional resellers of our products including traditional office supply resellers, wholesalers and other retailers, including on-line retailers. Mass merchandisers and retail channels primarily sell to individual consumers but also to small businesses. We also sell to commercial contract dealers, wholesalers, distributors and independent dealers who primarily serve business end-users. Over half of our product sales by our customers are to business end-users, who generally seek premium products that have added value or ease-of-use features and a reputation for reliability, performance and professional appearance. Some of our binding and laminating equipment products are sold directly to high-volume end-users and commercial reprographic centers. We also sell calendar and computer products directly to consumers. &#32; 

Computer Products Group &#32; 

Our Computer Products Group designs, sources, distributes, markets and sells accessories for laptop and desktop computers and tablets. These accessories primarily include security products, input devices such as presenters, mice and trackballs, ergonomic aids such as foot and wrist rests, docking stations, and other PC and tablet accessories. We sell these products mostly under the Kensington &#174; , Microsaver &#174; &#32;and ClickSafe &#174; &#32;brand names, with the majority of revenue coming from the U.S. and Northern Europe. Our computer products are manufactured by third-party suppliers, principally in Asia, and are distributed from our regional facilities. Our computer products are sold primarily to consumer electronics retailers, information technology value-added resellers, original equipment manufacturers, and office products retailers, as well as directly to consumers on-line. 

For further information on our business segments see " Note 15. Information on Business Segments " to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report. 

Customers/Competition 

Our sales are generated principally in the U.S., Northern Europe, Brazil, Canada, Australia and Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 40% &#32;of our net sales were outside the U.S. Our top ten customers accounted for 55% &#32;of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 . Sales to Staples, our largest customer, amounted to approximately 14% , 13% &#32;and 13% &#32;of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;respectively. Sales to Office Depot, our second largest customer, amounted to approximately 10% &#32;and 11% &#32;of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;respectively. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our business serves a limited number of large and sophisticated customers, and a substantial reduction in sales to one or more of these customers could adversely impact our operating results , " and "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. " 

Our customer base is primarily made up of large global and regional resellers of our products including traditional office supply resellers, wholesalers and other retailers, including on-line retailers. Mass merchandisers and retail channels primarily sell to individual consumers but also to small businesses. We also sell to commercial contract dealers, wholesalers, distributors and independent dealers who primarily serve business end-users. Over half of our product sales by our customers are to business end-users, who generally seek premium products that have added value or ease-of-use features and a reputation for reliability, performance and professional appearance. Some of our binding and laminating equipment products are sold directly to high-volume end-users and commercial reprographic centers. We also sell calendar and computer products directly to consumers. 

Our customers have steadily consolidated over the last two decades. In late 2013, two of our large customers, Office Depot and OfficeMax, completed their merger. Since their merger, the combined company has taken actions to harmonize pricing from its suppliers, close retail outlets and rationalize its supply chain, which have negatively impacted, and will continue to negatively impact, our sales and margins. &#32;In early 2015, Staples, our largest customer, announced an agreement to acquire Office Depot; in the fourth quarter of 2015, the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") sued to block the proposed merger. Staples and Office Depot have stated they intend to contest the FTC's challenge. A hearing on the preliminary injunction sought by the FTC is scheduled to begin in March 2016. Together these two customers accounted for approximately 24% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;net sales. 

Historically, office product superstores have maintained a significant market share in office, school and dated goods. More recently, new outlets, including mass merchandisers, drug store chains and on-line retailers, have surfaced as meaningful competitors to the office products superstores and are successfully taking market share from office product superstores in many of our product categories, especially with consumers and small businesses. 

Other current trends among our customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding innovative new products and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times and in smaller quantities. Another trend is for retailers to import products directly from foreign sources and sell those products, 

which compete with our products, under the retailer's own private-label brands. Our increased focus on the mass channel and sales growth with on-line retailers has helped to partially offset declines in the office superstore channel due to consolidation and channel shifts. The combination of these market influences, along with a continuing trend of consolidation among resellers, has created an intensely competitive environment in which our principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers they use. This results in pricing pressures and the need for stronger end-user brands, broader product penetration within categories, ongoing introduction of innovative new products and continuing improvements in customer service. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our customers may further consolidate, which could adversely impact our sales and margins , " " - Shifts in the channels of distribution for our products could adversely impact our business , " " - Challenges related to the highly competitive business segments in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our ongoing business, results of operation and financial condition, " " - Our success partially depends on our ability to continue to develop and market innovative products that meet end-user demands, including price expectations , " and "- The market for products sold by our Computer Products Group is rapidly changing and highly competitive . " 

Competitors of our ACCO Brands North America and ACCO Brands International segments include 3M, Blue Sky, Carolina Pad, CCL Industries, Dominion Blueline, Esselte, Fellowes, Franklin Covey, Hamelin, House of Doolittle, Newell Rubbermaid, RR Donnelley, Smead, Spiral Binding and numerous private label suppliers and importers. Competitors of the Computer Products Group include Belkin, Fellowes, Logitech, Targus and Zagg. 

Certain financial information for each of our business segments and geographic regions is incorporated by reference to " Note 15. Information on Business Segments " to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. of this report. 

Product Development and Product Line Rationalization 

Our strong commitment to understanding our consumers and defining products that fulfill their needs drives our product development strategy, which we believe is and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. Our new products are developed from our own consumer understanding, our own research and development or through partnership initiatives with inventors and vendors. Costs related to consumer research and product research when paid directly by ACCO Brands are included in marketing costs and research and development expenses, respectively. Research and development expenses amounted to $20.0 million , $20.2 million &#32;and $22.5 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were 1.3% , 1.2% &#32;and 1.3% &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our success partially depends on our ability to continue to develop and market innovative products that meet end-user demands, including price expectations . " 

We consistently review our businesses and product offerings, assess their strategic fit and seek opportunities to divest nonstrategic businesses and rationalize our product offerings. The criteria we use in assessing the strategic fit include: the ability to increase sales for the business; the ability to create strong, differentiated brands; the importance of the business to key customers; the business's relationship with existing product lines; the impact of the business to the market; and the business's actual and potential impact on our operating performance. As a result of this review process, during 2014, we made a strategic decision that resulted in the loss of low-margin retail bindery business related to a large customer in the North America segment and repositioned the Computer Products Group by shifting our focus away from certain commoditized tablet accessories. These decisions continued to impact us in 2015. See also "Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. " 

Raw Materials 

The primary materials used in the manufacturing of many of our products are paper, plastics, resin, polyester and polypropylene substrates, steel, wood, aluminum, melamine, zinc and cork. These materials are available from a number of suppliers, and we are not dependent upon any single supplier for any of these materials. Based on our experience, we believe that adequate quantities of these materials will be available in the foreseeable future. See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks associated with currency volatility could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flow and results of operations , " and " - Fluctuation in the costs of raw materials, labor and transportation and changes in international shipping capacity as well as issues affecting port availability and efficiency, such as labor strikes, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition . " 

Supply 

Our products are either manufactured or sourced to ensure that we supply our customers with appropriate customer service, quality products, innovative solutions and attractive pricing. We have built a customer-focused business model with a flexible supply chain to ensure that these factors are appropriately balanced. Using a combination of manufacturing and third-party sourcing also enables us to reduce our costs and effectively manage our production assets by lowering capital investment and working 

capital requirements. Our strategy is to manufacture locally those products that would incur a relatively high freight and/or duty expense or have high service needs and source those products that have a high proportion of direct labor cost. We currently manufacture approximately half of our products locally where we operate, and source the remaining half. Low-cost sourcing primarily comes from China, but we also source from other Far Eastern countries and Eastern Europe. 

Seasonality 

Historically, our business has experienced higher sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. Two principal factors contribute to this seasonality: (1) the office products industry, its customers and ACCO Brands specifically are major suppliers of products related to the "back-to-school" season, which occurs principally from June through September for our North American business and from November through February for our Australian and Brazilian businesses; and (2) several products we sell lend themselves to calendar year-end purchase timing, including AT-A-GLANCE &#174; &#32;and Day-Timer &#174; &#32;planners, paper organization and storage products (including bindery) and Kensington computer accessories, which have higher sales in the fourth quarter driven by traditionally strong fourth-quarter sales of personal computers and tablets. &#32;As a result, we have generated, and expect to continue to generate, most of our earnings in the second half of the year and much of our cash flow in the first, third and fourth quarters as receivables are collected.

Intellectual Property 

We have many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are, in the aggregate, important to our business. The loss of any individual patent or license, however, would not be material to us taken as a whole. Many of ACCO Brands' trademarks are only important in particular geographic markets or regions. Our principal registered trademarks are: ACCO &#174; , AT-A-GLANCE &#174; , ClickSafe &#174; , Day-Timer &#174; , Five Star &#174; , GBC &#174; , Hilroy, Kensington &#174; , Marbig, Mead &#174; , MicroSaver &#174; &#32;NOBO, Quartet &#174; , Rexel, Swingline &#174; , Tilibra, and Wilson Jones &#174; . See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our inability to secure, protect and maintain rights to intellectual property could have an adverse impact on our business . " 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling, disposal and clean-up of waste materials and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. In the opinion of our management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, financial condition and results of operations or competitive position. &#32;See also "Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to global environmental regulation and environmental risks, product content and product safety laws and regulations as well as laws, regulations and self-regulatory requirements relating to privacy and data security ." 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 5,020 &#32;full-time and part-time employees. There have been no strikes or material labor disputes at any of our facilities during the past five years. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

For a description of certain factors that may have had, or may in the future have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors ."
