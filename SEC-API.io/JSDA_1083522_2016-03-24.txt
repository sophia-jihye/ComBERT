 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

Overview 

We develop, produce, market and distribute premium beverages which we sell and distribute primarily in the United States and Canada through our network of independent distributors and directly to our national and regional retail accounts. We also sell products in select international markets. Our products are sold primarily in grocery stores, convenience and gas stores, &#8220;up and down the street&#8221; in independent accounts such as delicatessens and sandwich shops, as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers. We refer to our network of independent distributors as our direct store delivery (DSD) channel, and we refer to our national and regional accounts who receive shipments directly from us as our direct to retail (DTR) channel. We do not directly manufacture our products , but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party contract manufacturers. We also sell various products online, including soda with customized labels, wearables, candy and other items, and we license our trademarks for use on products sold by other manufacturers. 

Our company is a Washington corporation formed in 2000 as a successor to Urban Juice and Soda Company Ltd., a Canadian company formed in 1986. O ur principal place of business is &#160; located at 66 South Hanford Street , Suite 150 , Seattle, Washington 98134. Our telephone number is (206) 624-3357. 

Jones Soda Products 

Our strategy is to focus on our core brand, Jones Soda, within the sparkling beverage category. Our product line-up currently consists of the following: 

Jones Soda 

Jones Soda is our premium carbonated soft drink. We sell &#160; Jones Soda &#160; in glass bottle s and &#160; cans, with every label featuring a photo sent to us by our consumers. We also sell Jones Soda on fountain, utilizing customer photos on the fountain equipment and cups. Over 1 million photos have been submitted to us. We believe this unique interaction with our consumers distinguishes our brand and offers a strong competitive advantage for Jones Soda . Equally differentiating is the bright, colorful look of our drinks, which have distinctive names such as FuFu Berry and Berry Lemonade. We also sell Jones Soda in more traditional flavors such as Cream Soda, Root Be e r &#160; and Orange &#38; Cream . Jones Soda is made with high quality ingredients, including pure cane sugar. 

Jones Zilch 

Jones Zilch is a sugar-free version of our Jones Soda line providing an alternative for consumers. Jones Zilch , sweetened with Splenda &#174; and with zero calories, is an important product extension, especially in light of the increasing consumer preferences for zero and lower-calorie options. Jones Zilch is sold in glass bottles, cans and on fountain. 

Jones Stripped 

Jones Stripped is our natural ingredient and low-calorie premium carbonated soft drink. Jones Stripped is lightly sweetened with a unique blend of natural sweeteners and contains 30 calories and is packaged in the classic Jones Soda presentation in a clear, long-neck, glass bottle, with every bottle label featuring a photo sent to us by our consumers. With no artificial colors, the soda is clear, but the packaging features a burst of color on the label. 

Sparkling Beverage Industry 

Our Jones Soda &#160; beverages are classified in the sparkling beverage category, which encompasses the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) segment (our Jones Soda and Jones Zilch lines) and the natural carbonated drinks (natural sparkling) segment (for our Jones Stripped line) . The CSD segment is the largest segment in the sparkling beverage category, and in the U.S., is a $7 7 .4 billion industry (according to the &#160; April 17 , 201 5 issue of Beverage Digest ). During 201 4 , the CSD segment resumed growth with an increase of &#160; 1 .4 % as a result of raising prices, partially offset by volume declines of 0.9% (according to the April 17, 2015 issue of Beverage Digest). Within the CSD segment are craft and premium sodas, which provide consumers with an alternative to the large corporate brands and is where our Jones Soda line competes. In the U.S., the craft and premium sodas are typically distributed through the grocery, drug, mass, club, convenience, independent account and online sales channels.

New Products 

As part of our growth strategy, we create new products and brands in the beverage industry. In 2016, we announced two new product lines. 

&#160; 

Lemoncocco 

&#160; 

Lemoncocco is a new premium non-carbonated blended beverage &#160; that we officially launched in January 2016. Lemoncocco represents &#160; a new brand in the non-carbonated segment of the beverage industry, an important category for the industry . &#160; Lemoncocco was inspired by the refreshment stands found along the streets of Rome, Italy . 

&#160; 

7 - Select &#174; Premium Sodas crafted by Jones Soda Co. 

&#160; 

In February 2016, we announced our partnership with 7 - Eleven , Inc. wherein both compan ies partnered to create 7 - Select brand premium sodas crafted by Jones, the first premium carbonated beverage in the 7-Select private brand lineup . 7-Select is available exclusively at participating 7-Eleven locations across the United States. 

Our Focus for Fiscal 201 6 : Sales Growth 

Our focus fo r fiscal 201 6 is driving to profitability through case sale and revenue growth. Over the past three and a half years, we implemented substantial internal changes to our organization, and &#160; have achieved significant reductions in our operating expenses and efficiencies in our operations . 

The following are key components of this focus for 201 6 : 

&#183; 

Utilize the strategic distribution improvements implemented across the United States and Canada &#160; to grow national and independent account sales of our core Jones Soda line s; 

&#183; 

Build upon partnerships with major retail chains, such as 7-Eleven, Inc., in innovative ways, while continuing to build our base of independent accounts; 

&#183; 

Expand our fountain program of our core product lines in the United States and Canadian marketplace s ; 

&#183; 

Build the Lemoncocco brand in select markets in the United States and Canada; &#160; and 

&#183; 

Increase the focus on international expansion . 

Product Distribution and Sales Strategy 

Our core products are distributed and sold throughout the U.S. and Canada and in select international markets. Our primary distribution channels are our direct store delivery (DSD) channel (sales and distribution through our network of independent distributors) and our direct to retail (DTR) channel (sales directly to national and regional retail accounts). We also have our online channel for i nternet sales of various products. We strategically build our national and regional retailer network by focusing on distribution systems that we believe will provide top-line drivers for our products and increased availability and visibility of our products in our core markets. In building and expanding our DSD channel, we also consider international markets and look for regions that data suggests have a high affinity for the Jones brand and can be pursued within our financial resources. For 201 6 , we are focusing our efforts internationally on Ireland, the United Kingdom and Costa Rica. 

Part of our strategy in building our distribution system is to blend our DSD and DTR distribution channels, delivering different offerings through alternate channels. In determining the most advantageous distribution channel, we also consider what works best for the customer, allowing for better retail activation and in-store presence, including seeking placement on shelves that are normally restricted to national mainstream brands and placement in the cold-aisle, thus providing us access to the important &#8220;take home market.&#8221; We are selective in placing &#160; our can s &#160; to complement rather than compet e &#160; with our traditional glass bottles &#160; and currently maintain national distribution for this product through the Kroger Co. We believe our can offering provides our customers with an alternative method of consuming our premium soda and we may consider other national retail accounts for this package format. &#160; We have also introduced a fountain format for our sodas. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our top three accounts by revenue represent approximately 33% of revenue. We intend to continue to expand our distributor network and DTR accounts, which may result in a decreased dependence on any one or more of our independent distributors or national retail accounts. 

We contract with independent trucking companies to have our product shipped from our contract manufacturers to independent warehouses and then on to our distributors and national retail accounts. Distributors then sell and deliver our products either to sub-distributors or directly to retail accounts. We recognize revenue upon receipt by our distributors and 

&#160;

Table of Contents 

national account customers of our products, net of discounts and promotional allowances, and all sales are final; however, in limited instances, due to credit issues, quality or damage issues, or distributor changes, we may accept returned product, which to date ha s not been material. 

DSD (direct store delivery) 

We maintain a network of independent distributors across the U.S. and Canada. We have also secured distribution with independent distributors in Ireland, the United Kingdom and Costa Rica and are evaluating other international opportunities for our products. We choose our distributors based on our perception of their ability to build our brand franchise in convenience stores, grocery stores, and &#8220;up and down the street&#8221; in independent accounts such as delicatessens and sandwich shops. Typically, we grant our independent distributors exclusive distribution rights in defined territories, which may include invasion fees in the event we provide product directly to one of our national retailers located in the distributor&#8217;s region. We are also obligated to pay termination fees for cancellations of most of these written distributor agreements, unless the termination is &#8216;for cause.&#8217; We intend to continue our efforts to reinforce and expand our distribution network by partnering with new distributors and replacing underperforming distributors. In addition to the efforts of our independent distributors in obtaining distribution of our products, we actively seek to obtain listings for our products with key retail grocery, convenience and mass merchandiser accounts, which are serviced through our independent distributor network. 

Product availability at a specific store location for any of our named retailers is subject to the retailer, consumer demand, and localized store variances. Our accounts listing changes from time to time, as new retail accounts are added and others are canceled. To find a retailer that carries our products, our product locator is available on our website under &#8220; Store -Product Locator.&#8221; 

DTR (direct to retail) 

Our direct to retail channel of distribution is an important part of our strategy to target large national or regional restaurant chains and retail accounts, including &#160; convenience store chains, mass merchandisers and premier food-service businesses. Through these programs, we negotiate directly with the retailer to carry our products, and the account is serviced through the retailer&#8217;s appointed distribution system (rather than through our DSD network). These arrangements are terminable at any time by these retailers or us, and contain no minimum purchase commitments or termination fees. 

Fountain 

Beginning in 2015 , we are offering Jones Soda and Jones Zilch in fountain format, which we are calling Jones Cane Sugar Fountain . We are working with a group of fountain distributors in our DSD network in select regions in the U.S. and Canada to provide proprietary fountain equipment or other methods to offer fountain products. The fountain equipment is branded similarly as our traditional bottles and cans, prominently displaying our consumer submitted photos. We sell concentrate to the distributors for use in the fountain equipment. Our fountain offerings include traditional flavors such as C ola, D iet C ola, G inger A le , Orange &#38; Cream and L emon L ime, while also offering fun flavors such as Berry Lemonade and Green Apple . 

Sales 

Our products are sold throughout the U.S. and Canada, primarily in convenience stores, grocery stores, and &#8220;up and down the street&#8221; in independent accounts such as delicatessens and sandwich shops, as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers. In 2015 , sales in the U.S. represented approximately 70% of total sales, while sales in Canada represented approximately 27% , and we had approximately 3 % in other international sales. 

Our Brand 

Building our Brand 

We have built our brand to a large extent on our independent counter-culture image as well as by providing unique and exciting flavors that appeal to consumers who prefer alternatives to the corporate CSD brands. This market is driven by trendy, young consumers looking for a distinctive tonality in their beverage choices. While we are known for our unique and innovative flavors, we also feature flavors that we believe have a large base of consumer appeal. Additionally, through the labels on our bottles and our invitation to consumers to send in photographs to be featured on the Jones Soda labels, we focus on a coherent message and call to action, thus escaping the uniformity that we believe plagues so many other brands. We select photos throughout the year to be placed on our bottles and cans for distribution, and also invite consumers to celebrate special occasions and memories by creating their own label through myJones.com . In that space, consumers have the ability to customize their own label and product with a photo and short caption using a proprietary patented process. In addition to creative labeling on our products, we provide our distributors with point-of-sale promotional materials and branded apparel items. We believe that our labeling, marketing and promotional materials are important elements to creating and increasing consumer appeal, as well as distributor and retailer awareness, and that our branding efforts have helped us achieve strong consumer connections and affinity levels for our products. 

&#160;

Brand Marketing 

Our marketing team has developed brand positioning and brand identity that is an integral asset and we believe allows our brand to be widely known in a positive way among a large demographic. We have a successful history of positioning ourselves in alternative accounts with the intent to be where national mainstream brands are not sold. We also have a program of sponsoring alternative sport athletes to promote our products in youth alternative sports, including skateboarding and snowboarding. We also have a program of sponsoring up and coming music bands . We believe this effort to position our products in alternative accounts and venues draws on a younger generation of customers that value their independence away from the larger soft drink brands. 

Social Media 

Our core marketing pillar is the open access our consumers have to define the brand through our website Jonessoda.com. We actively participate in blogs and several different social media campaigns as a way of direct engagement with our consumers in order to listen to their voices and better understand their issues and changes in consumer trends. Social media represents one of the largest shifts in modern business away from static advertising, and we have had success in creating social media hubs through forums such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram . &#160; Our consumers have responded by bringing us onto their social media pages and into their lives, creating a personal connection that we believe helps ensure they are actively engaged with our brand and our products. 

Consumer Submitted Photos 

We are well-known for the photos on our labels. We invite our consumers to send us photos of their lives, and we select from those photos for use on our labels. Photos can be submitted through our website at our &#8220;Jones Soda &#160; Photo Gallery.&#8221; Every Jones Soda glass bottle and can has a picture provided to us by a consumer. 

Customized Photo Labels 

We also provide our Jones Soda customers, ranging from businesses to end consumers, customized and personalized 6-packs and 12-packs of Jones Soda &#160; ( in bottles) that they can create with their own photos on the labels. The strategy of this program is to provide a customized and personalized product offering to our consumers as well as an innovative marketing opportunity for our Jones Soda brand. Consumers can upload their photos through our website and create their own &#8220;myJones&#8221; labels. The personalized labels are downloaded at our headquarters, applied to 12-packs of Jones Soda and delivered to the consumer. 

We believe our photo strategy has increased awareness for, as well as provided for increased consumer interactivity with, the Jones Soda brand. 

Point of Sale and Consumer Awareness 

We use point-of-sale materials such as posters, stickers, hats and T-shirts to create and increase consumer awareness of our proprietary products and brands. In response to consumer demand, we also sell our products and our wearables on our website. In selected cities, we participate at a &#8220;grassroots&#8221; level at certain community and sporting events in an attempt to create and increase brand awareness and loyalty. We use recreational vehicles, vans and independent distributor vehicles painted with the Jones colors and logos to create consumer awareness and enthusiasm at these events and to assist distributors as they open new retail accounts and markets. 

From time to time, we partner with companies that will manufacture Jones-related products that we feel extend and enhance our Jones brand. We currently have a licensing arrangement with a third party to manufacture and distribute Jones Soda Flavor Booster hard candy. In addition to these marketing techniques, we also pursue cross-promotional campaigns with other companies. 

&#160;

Partnership with Young Audiences 

Beginning in 2014, we partnered with Young Audiences to laun ch the Jones Soda Photography Curriculum , which was created to teach children about the art of photography. Young Audience&#8217;s mission is to ensure arts remain an integral part of youth education, with the help of organizations such as Jones Soda. We feel that it is a worthy cause directly aimed at supporting the children that make up our fan base. Customer-submitted photos are one of our key assets, and to utilize them in a way that we can give back to the community, is directly aligned with the brand&#8217;s core values. 

Brand and Product Development 

We understand the importance of creating new beverage products and enhancing our existing products to meet the ever changing consumer taste profile. W e continue to expand our &#160; Jones Cane Sugar Fountain &#160; program that allows for our Jones Soda product line to be offered &#8220; on tap .&#8221; We partner with rest a urants and grocery stores that prefer to offer new innovative and pure cane sugar fountain opportunities for their guests and we utilize a select group of fountain distributors to service these retail customers. &#160; 

Our strategy is to focus on innovative products that will be accepted by consumers, retailers and distributors. We believe this is accomplished by keeping open dialog directly with our consumers through our website, blogs and social media as well as with our retail and distributor partners to ensure we are current with consumer trends in the beverage industry. 

We develop the majority of our brands and products in-house. We used a similar process initially to create the Jones Soda brand, and we intend to continue utilizing this process to create our future brands and products. This process primarily consists of the following steps: 

Market Evaluation. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of certain categories and segments of the beverage industry with a view to pinpointing potential opportunities. 

Distributor Evaluation. We analyze existing and potential distribution channels, whether DSD, DTR or a blend of these channels. This analysis addresses, among other things, which companies will distribute particular beverage brands and products, where such companies may distribute such brands and products, and what will motivate these distributors to distribute such brands and products. 

Production Evaluation. We review all aspects of production of our beverages, including contract packing capacity, strategic production locations, and quality control, and prepare a cost analysis of the various considerations that will be critical to producing our brands and products. 

Image and Design. Based on our evaluation of the market, distributors and production issues, we create and develop the concept for a beverage brand, product or product extension. Our technical services department then works with various flavor concentrate houses to test, choose and develop product flavors for the brand. 

We believe that the ongoing process of creating new brands, products and product extensions will be an important factor in our long-term success. 

In addition to the above extensions to the Jones Soda brand, we have created and launched a new brand with its own separate identity from the Jones Soda brand, Lemoncocco TM . We believe that Lemoncocco represents a new category in the non-carbonated beverage industry and that developing a separate all natural beverage brand is an important opportunity for the company. &#160; 

&#160; 

We have also announced our partnership with 7 - Eleven , Inc. wherein both compan ies partnered to create 7 - Select brand premium sodas crafted by Jones, the first premium carbonated beverage in the 7-Select private brand lineup . &#160; 7-Select premium sodas crafted by Jones are available exclusively at participating 7-Eleven locations across the United States. &#160; 

Competition 

The beverage industry is highly competitive. Principal methods of competition in the beverage industry include: 

&#183; 

distribution; 

&#183; 

shelf-management; 

&#183; 

licensing; 

&#183; 

brand name and image; 

&#183; 

price; 

&#183; 

labeling and packaging; 

&#160;

Table of Contents 

&#183; 

advertising; 

&#183; 

product quality and taste; 

&#183; 

trade and consumer promotions; and 

&#183; 

development of new brands, products and product extensions. 

We compete with other beverage companies not only for consumer acceptance but also for shelf space in retail accounts and for marketing focus by our distributors, all of whom also distribute other beverage brands. Our products compete with all non-alcoholic beverages, most of which are marketed by companies with substantially greater financial resources than ours. We also compete with regional beverage producers and &#8220;private label&#8221; soft drink suppliers. Our direct competitors in the sparkling beverage industry include Dr. Pepper Snapple (Stewart's and IBC), Boylan, Henry Weinhard&#8217;s, Thomas Kemper, and other regional premium soft drink companies. We also compete against Coca - Cola, Pepsi, Hansen&#8217;s, and other traditional soft drink manufacturers and distributors. Our fountain offering competes directly with Coca - Cola and Pepsi. 

In order to compete effectively in the beverage industry, from time to time we develop and introduce new products and product extensions, and when warranted, new brands . &#160; E xample s of this i nclude Lemoncocco , a new beverage &#160; we officially launched in January 2016 , and &#160; Jones Stripped , which we launched in 2013 to enhance our sparkling portfolio . 

Although we believe that we will be able to continue to create competitive and relevant brands and products to satisfy consumers&#8217; changing preferences, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that other companies will not be more successful in this regard over the long term. 

Pricing of the products is also important. We believe that our products are priced in the same price range or higher than competitive brands and products and compete on quality as they are premium product offerings. 

Production 

Contract Packing Arrangements 

We do not directly manufacture our products , but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third party bottlers and independent contract manufacturers (co-packers). We currently use primary co-packers located in Canada and the U.S. as well as a co-packer in the United Kingdom. Once the product is manufactured, the finished products are stored either at the co-packer&#8217;s location or in nearby third-party warehouses. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run for most co-packers, we do not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. Our co-packers may terminate their arrangements with us at any time, in which case we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers. We continually review our contract packing needs in light of regulatory compliance and logistical requirements and may add or change co-packers based on those needs. 

Raw Materials 

The raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products consist primarily of concentrate, flavors, supplements, sugar, bottles, cans, labels, trays, caps and packaging. Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our bottle and can products are purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our specifications. These raw materials are purchased from suppliers selected by us or by our contract manufacturers. We believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials, which are available from multiple suppliers. 

We purchase flavor concentrate from our suppliers. Generally, flavor concentrate suppliers own the proprietary rights to the flavors. Although we do not have the list of ingredients or formulas for our flavors, we have exclusive rights to the use of the flavor concentrates developed with our suppliers. In connection with the development of new products and flavors, independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense for product development, thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. If we have to replace a flavor supplier, we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

The costs of raw materials fluctuate and in certain instances we enter into supply agreements to address these risks. We have a three-year fixed price supply agreement with our primary glass supplier which expires at the end of 2016 . The price of glass continues to increase each year due to the shortage of available glass in the industry; however, our supply agreement with our glass supplier provides us with some price protection. 

Quality Control 

Our products are made from high quality ingredients and natural and artificial flavors. We seek to ensure that all of our products satisfy our high quality standards. Contract manufacturers are selected and monitored by our quality control representatives in an effort to ensure adherence to our production procedures and quality standards. 

&#160;

Table of Contents 

For every run of product, our contract manufacturer undertakes extensive testing of product quality and packaging. This includes testing levels of sweetness, carbonation, taste, product integrity, packaging and various regulatory cross checks. Samples from each production run are analyzed and categorized in a reference library. For each product, the contract manufacturer must transmit all quality control test results to us for reference following each production run. 

Testing also includes microbiological checks and other tests to ensure the production facilities meet the standards and specifications of our quality assurance program. Water quality is monitored during production and at scheduled testing times to ensure compliance with beverage industry standards. The water used to produce our products is filtered and is also treated to reduce alkalinity. Flavors are pre-tested by the flavor concentrate supplier before shipment to contract manufacturers. We are committed to ongoing product improvement with a view towards ensuring the high quality of our product through a stringent co-packer selection, training and communication program. 

Regulation 

The production and marketing of our proprietary beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, provincial, state and local health agencies, including in particular Health Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA and AAFC also regulate labeling of our products. From time to time, we may receive notifications of various technical labeling or ingredient reviews with respect to our products. We believe that we have a compliance program in place to ensure compliance with production, marketing and labeling regulations. 

Legal requirements have been enacted in jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada requiring that deposits or certain eco-taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other beverage container-related deposit, recycling, eco-tax and/or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada. We anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the U.S. and Canada. 

Trademarks, Flavor Concentrate Trade Secrets and Patent Rights 

In the U.S., we own a number of trademark registrations (designated by the &#174; symbol) and pending trademark applications (designated by the &#8482; symbol) for use in connection with our products, including &#8220;JONES &#174; ,&#8221; &#8220;JONES SODA CO. &#174; ,&#8221; &#8220;JONES ZILCH &#174; ,&#8221; &#8220;JONES STRIPPED &#8482; &#8221; and &#8220;LEMONCOCCO &#8482; &#8221; . 

In general, trademark registrations expire 10 years from the filing date or registration date, with the exception in Canada, where trademark registrations expire 15 years from the registration date. All trademark registrations may be renewed for a nominal fee. 

We have the exclusive rights to our flavor concentrates developed with our current flavor concentrate suppliers, which we protect as trade secrets. We will continue to take appropriate measures to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our flavor concentrates. 

We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. 

Seasonality 

Our sales are seasonal and we experience fluctuations in quarterly results due to many factors. We historically have generated a greater percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. As a result, management believes that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the fiscal year. 

Employees 

As of the date of this Report, we have 2 6 &#160; employees, all but two &#160; of which are full-time. Of our 2 6 &#160; employees, 1 6 &#160; are employed in sales and marketing capacities, 6 &#160; are employed in administrative capacities and 4 are employed in customer service, manufacturing and quality control capacities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions.
