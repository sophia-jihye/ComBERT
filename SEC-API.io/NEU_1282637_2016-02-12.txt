Business Segments 

Our business is composed of one segment, petroleum additives, which is primarily represented by Afton. The TEL business of Ethyl is reflected in the &#8220;All other&#8221; category. Each of these is discussed below. 

Petroleum Additives &#8212;Petroleum additives are used in lubricating oils and fuels to enhance their performance in machinery, vehicles, and other equipment. We manufacture chemical components that are selected to perform one or more specific functions and combine those chemicals with other components to form additive packages for use in specified end-user applications. The petroleum additives market is a global marketplace, with customers ranging from oil companies and refineries to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and other specialty chemical companies. 

We believe our success in the petroleum additives market is largely due to our ability to deliver value to our customers through our products and our open, flexible, and collaborative working style. We accomplish this by understanding what our customers value and by applying our technical capabilities, formulation expertise, broadly differentiated product solutions, and global distribution capabilities to satisfy the customers' needs. We invest significantly in research and development in order to meet our customers&#8217; needs and to adapt to the rapidly changing environment for new and improved products and services. 

We view the petroleum additives marketplace as being comprised of two broad product applications: lubricant additives and fuel additives. Lubricant additives are highly formulated chemical packages that, when blended with base fluids, improve the efficiency, durability, performance, and functionality of mineral oils, synthetic oils, and biodegradable fluids, thereby enhancing the performance of machinery and engines. Fuel additives are chemical components and formulations that improve the refining process and performance of gasoline, diesel, biofuels, and other fuels, resulting in lower operating costs, improved vehicle performance, and reduced tailpipe or smokestack emissions. 

Lubricant Additives 

Lubricant additives are essential ingredients for lubricating oils. Lubricant additives are used in a wide variety of vehicle and industrial applications, including engine oils, transmission fluids, off-road equipment, gear oils, hydraulic oils, turbine oils, industrial oils, metalworking fluids and virtually any other application where metal-to-metal moving parts are utilized. Lubricant additives are organic and synthetic chemical components that enhance wear protection, prevent deposits, and protect against the hostile operating environment of an engine, transmission, axle, hydraulic pump, or industrial machine. 

Lubricants are widely used in operating machinery from heavy industrial equipment to transportation vehicles. Lubricants provide a layer of protection between moving mechanical parts. Without this layer of protection, the normal functioning of machinery would not occur. Effective lubricants reduce downtime and increase efficiency. Specifically, lubricants serve the following main functions: 

&#8226; 

friction reduction&#8212;Friction is reduced by maintaining a thin film of lubricant between moving surfaces, preventing them from coming into direct contact with one another and reducing wear on moving machinery, thereby providing longer life and operational efficiency. 

&#8226; 

heat removal &#8212; Lubricants act as coolants by removing heat resulting either from friction or through contact with other, higher temperature materials. 

&#8226; 

containment of contaminants &#8212; Lubricants function by carrying contaminants away from the machinery and neutralizing the harmful impact of the by-products created by combustion. 

The functionality of lubricants is created through an exact balance between a base fluid and performance enhancing additives. This balance is the goal of effective formulations achieved by experienced research and development professionals. We offer a full line of lubricant additive packages, each of which is composed of component chemicals specially selected to perform desired functions. We manufacture most of the chemical components and blend these components to create formulated additives packages designed to meet industry and customer specifications. Lubricant additive components are generally classified based upon their intended functionality, including: 

&#8226; 

detergents, which clean moving parts of engines and machines, suspend oil contaminants and combustion by-products, and absorb acidic combustion products; 

&#8226; 

dispersants, which serve to inhibit the formation of sludge and particulates; 

&#8226; 

extreme pressure/antiwear agents, which reduce wear on moving engine and machinery parts; 

&#8226; 

viscosity index modifiers, which improve the viscosity and temperature characteristics of lubricants and help the lubricant flow evenly to all parts of an engine or machine; and 

&#8226; 

antioxidants, which prevent oil from degrading over time. 

We are one of the leading global suppliers of specially formulated lubricant additives that combine some or all of the components described above to develop our products. Our products are highly formulated, complex chemical compositions derived from extensive research and testing to ensure all additive components work together to provide the intended results. Our products are engineered to meet specifications prescribed by either the industry or a specific customer. Purchasers of lubricant additives tend to be oil companies, distributors, refineries, and compounders/blenders. We make no sales directly to end-users. 

We view our participation in the lubricant marketplace in three primary areas: engine oil additives, driveline additives, and industrial additives. Our view is not necessarily the same way others view the market. 

Engine Oil Additives&#8212; The largest submarket within the lubricant additives marketplace is engine oil additives which consists of additives designed for passenger cars, as well as heavy duty commercial equipment. We estimate engine oil additives represent approximately 70% of the overall lubricant additives market volume. The engine oil market&#8217;s primary customers include consumers, fleet owners, service dealers, and OEMs. The primary functions of engine oil additives are to reduce friction, prevent wear, control formation of sludge and oxidation, and prevent rust. Engine oil additives are typically sold to lubricant manufacturers who combine them with a base oil fluid to meet internal, industry, and OEM specifications. 

Key drivers of the engine oils market are the total vehicle miles driven, fuel economy, number of vehicles on the road, the average age of vehicles on the road, drain intervals, engine and crankcase size, changes in engine design, and temperature and specification changes driven by the OEMs. The extension of drain intervals has generally offset increased demand due to higher vehicle population, new hardware, and more miles driven. Afton offers products that enhance the performance of mineral, part-synthetic, and fully-synthetic engine oils. 

Driveline Additives&#8212; The driveline additives submarket is comprised of additives designed for products such as transmission fluids and gear oils, as well as axle and off-road fluids. This submarket shares in the 30% of the market not covered by engine oil additives. Transmission fluids primarily serve as the power transmission and heat transfer medium in the area of the transmission where the torque of the drive shaft is transferred to the gears of the vehicle. Gear oil additives lubricate gears, bearings, clutches, and bands in the gear-box and are used in vehicles, as well as in off-highway, hydraulic, and marine equipment. Other products in this area include hydraulic transmission fluids, universal tractor fluids, power steering fluids, shock absorber fluids, gear oils, and lubricants for heavy machinery. These products must conform to highly prescribed specifications developed by vehicle OEMs for specific models or designs. These additives are generally sold to oil companies for ultimate sale to vehicle OEMs for new vehicles (factory-fill), service dealers for aftermarket servicing (service-fill), retailers, and distributors. 

Key drivers of the driveline additives marketplace are the number of vehicles manufactured, total number of vehicles in operation, drain intervals for transmission fluids and gear applications, changes in engine and transmission design and temperatures, and specification changes driven by the OEMs. 

Industrial Additives&#8212; The industrial additives submarket is comprised of additives designed for products for industrial applications such as hydraulic fluids, grease, industrial gear fluids, industrial specialty applications, and metalworking additives. This submarket also shares in the 30% of the market not covered by engine oil additives. These products must conform to industry specifications, OEM requirements, and/or application and operating environment demands. Industrial additives are generally sold to oil companies, service dealers for after-market servicing, and distributors. 

Key drivers of the industrial additives marketplace are gross domestic product levels and industrial production. 

Fuel Additives 

Fuel additives are chemical compounds that are used to improve both the oil refining process and the performance of gasoline, diesel, biofuels, and other fuels. Benefits of fuel additives in the oil refining process include reduced use of crude oil, lower processing costs, and improved fuel storage properties. Fuel performance benefits include ignition improvements, combustion efficiency, reduced emission particulates, fuel economy improvements, and engine cleanliness, as well as protection against deposits in fuel injectors, intake valves, and the combustion chamber. Our fuel additives are extensively tested and designed to meet stringent industry, government, OEM, and individual customer requirements. 

Many different types of additives are used in fuels. Their use is generally determined by customer, industry, OEM, and government specifications, and often differs from country to country. The types of fuel additives we offer include: 

&#8226; 

gasoline performance additives, which clean and maintain key elements of the fuel delivery systems, including fuel injectors and intake valves, in gasoline engines; 

&#8226; 

diesel fuel performance additives, which perform similar cleaning functions in diesel engines; 

&#8226; 

cetane improvers, which increase the cetane number (ignition quality) in diesel fuel by reducing the delay between injection and ignition; 

&#8226; 

stabilizers, which reduce or eliminate oxidation in fuel; 

&#8226; 

corrosion inhibitors, which minimize the corrosive effects of combustion by-products and prevent rust; 

&#8226; 

lubricity additives, which restore lubricating properties lost in the refining process; 

&#8226; 

cold flow improvers, which improve the pumping and flow of distillate and diesel fuels in cold temperatures; and 

&#8226; 

octane enhancers, which increase octane ratings and decrease emissions. 

We offer a broad line of fuel additives worldwide and sell our products to major fuel marketers and refiners, as well as independent terminals and other fuel blenders. 

Key drivers in the fuel additive marketplace include total vehicle miles driven, fuel economy, the introduction of new engine designs, regulations on emissions (both gasoline and diesel), quality of the crude oil slate and performance standards, and marketing programs of major oil companies. 

Competition 

We believe we are one of the four largest manufacturers and suppliers in the petroleum additives marketplace. 

In the lubricant additives submarket of petroleum additives, our major competitors are The Lubrizol Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.), Infineum (a joint venture between ExxonMobil Chemical and Royal Dutch Shell plc), and Chevron Oronite Company LLC. There are several other suppliers in the worldwide market who are competitors in their particular product areas. 

The fuel additives submarket is characterized by more competitors. While we participate in many facets of the fuel additives market, our competitors tend to be more narrowly focused. In the gasoline detergent market, we compete mainly against BASF, Chevron Oronite Company LLC, and The Lubrizol Corporation. In the diesel and refinery markets, we compete mainly against The Lubrizol Corporation, Infineum, BASF, Clariant Ltd., and Innospec Inc. (Innospec). We also compete against other regional competitors in the fuel additives marketplace. 

The competition among the participants in these industries is characterized by the need to provide customers with cost effective, technologically-capable products that meet or exceed industry specifications. The need to continually increase technology performance and lower cost through formulation technology and cost improvement programs is vital for success in this environment. 

All Other &#8212;The &#8220;All other&#8221; category includes the operations of the TEL business (primarily sales of TEL in North America), as well as certain contracted manufacturing and services performed by Ethyl. The Ethyl plant facility is located in Houston, Texas and is substantially dedicated to terminal operations related to TEL and other fuel additives. The financial results of the petroleum additives production by Ethyl are reflected in the petroleum additives segment results. The &#8220;All other&#8221; category financial results include a service fee charged by Ethyl for its production services to Afton. 

Raw Materials and Product Supply 

We use a variety of raw materials and chemicals in our manufacturing and blending processes and believe the sources of these are adequate for our current operations. The primary raw materials for Afton are base oil, polyisobutylene, antioxidants, alcohols, solvents, sulfonates, friction modifiers, olefins, and copolymers. 

As the performance requirements of our products become more complex, we often work with highly specialized suppliers. In some cases, we source from a single supplier. In cases where we decide to source from a single supplier, we manage our risk by maintaining safety stock of the raw material or qualifying alternate supply. The backup position could take additional time to implement, but we are confident we can ensure continued supply for our customers. We continue to monitor the raw material supply situation and continually adjust our procurement strategies as conditions require. 

Research, Development, and Testing 

Research, development, and testing (R&#38;D) provides Afton with new performance-based solutions for our customers in the petroleum additives market. We develop products through a combination of chemical synthesis, formulation development, engineering design, and performance testing. In addition to developing new products, R&#38;D provides our customers with data to substantiate product differentiation and technical support to assure total customer satisfaction. 

We are committed to providing the most advanced products, comprehensive testing programs, and superior technical solutions to our customers and to OEMs worldwide. R&#38;D expenditures, which totaled $158 million in 2015, $139 million in 2014, and $137 million in 2013, are expected to increase modestly in 2016. Afton continues to expand our internal testing, research, and customer support capabilities around the world in support of our goals of providing market-driven technical leadership and performance-based differentiation. 

Afton continues to develop new technology and products to meet the changing requirements of OEMs and to keep our customers well positioned for the future. A significant portion of our R&#38;D investment is dedicated to the development of products that are differentiated by their ability to deliver improved fuel efficiency in addition to robust performance in a wide range of new hardware designs. Afton&#8217;s state-of-the art testing capabilities are enabling customized research in all areas of performance needed by both OEMs and tier one suppliers. Our leading-edge capabilities and fundamental understanding in the areas of combustion, friction control, energy efficiency, and wear prevention are used to set the stage for next generation products in all areas. 

In 2015, we successfully launched new technologies across all of our lubricant additive and fuel additive product areas. We developed new engine oil products for passenger cars and commercial trucks in support of our customers in all the major regions of the world in which we operate. Research in the engine oil area continues to increase as we prepare for the new engine oil specifications in North America for passenger car motor oils and for commercial trucks. The new specification for commercial trucks will go into effect in 2016, and the new specification for passenger car motor oils in 2018. OEMs also continue to add their own requirements in addition to the general industry specifications, creating demand for new products tailored to the needs of individual OEMs. 

Our industrial additives product line continued to expand with the development of new products in multiple application areas including hydraulic fluids, industrial gear oils, turbine oils, grease additives, and metalworking fluid additives. Research is focused on the development of technologies that will provide differentiation to our customers in multiple performance areas including equipment life and energy efficiency. 

We continue to provide leading technology in the fuel additives area. In 2015, new products were developed and launched in all product lines including gasoline performance additives and diesel performance additives, as well as additives used in the refining and distribution of fuels. Research is focused on the development of new technologies that perform well in new, modern engine designs and changing fuel properties, as well as addressing the growing need for increased fuel economy and emissions reduction. In addition, we continue to maintain close interactions with regulatory, industry, and OEM leaders to guide our development of future fuel additive technologies based on well-defined market needs. 

Research continued in our transmission fluid, axle oil, and tractor fluid product lines. This included the development of new OEM-specific additives used in factory fill fluids during automotive component and vehicle assembly in the United States, Germany, Japan, India, and China. In addition, we developed new products for the service fill sector to provide our customers with the latest additive technology available to differentiate their offering to the market.

In 2015, we continued to enhance our &#8220;Actively Caring&#8221; safety program, where people look out for the safety and welfare of others with courage and compassion, enabling the achievement of an injury-free environment. Our worldwide injury/illness recordable rate (which is the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked) in 2015 &#32;was .54 . Our performance is a demonstration of our safety-first culture and represents a focused effort by all of our employees. We are extremely proud of our accomplishments in this area. Both Afton and Ethyl continue to be top performers among their industry peers. While our safety performance is very strong, we strive for continual improvement with a vision of having zero injuries. 

As members of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), Afton and Ethyl provide data on twelve metrics used to track environmental impact, safety, energy use, community outreach and emergency preparedness, greenhouse gas intensity, and product stewardship performance of the ACC member companies. These can be viewed at http://responsiblecare.americanchemistry.com/Performance-Results . The information on this website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

Environmental 

We operate under policies that we believe comply with federal, state, local, and foreign requirements regarding the handling, manufacture, and use of materials. One or more regulatory agencies may classify some of these materials as hazardous or toxic. We also believe that we comply in all material respects with laws, regulations, statutes, and ordinances protecting the environment, including those related to the discharge of materials. We expect to continue to comply in all material respects. We regularly review the status of significant existing or potential environmental issues. 

Our total accruals for environmental remediation, dismantling, and decontamination were approximately $17 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and $18 million &#32; December 31, 2014 . 

As new technology becomes available, it may be possible to reduce accrued amounts. While we believe that we are currently fully accrued for known environmental issues, it is possible that unexpected future costs could have a significant financial impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

We spent approximately $22 million &#32;in 2015 , $22 million &#32;in 2014 , and $19 million &#32;in 2013 &#32;for ongoing environmental operating and clean-up costs, excluding depreciation of previously capitalized expenditures. These environmental operating and clean-up expenses are primarily included in cost of goods sold. 

For capital expenditures on pollution prevention and safety projects, we spent $13 million &#32;in 2015 , $12 million &#32;in 2014 , and $11 million &#32;in 2013 . We expect expenditures in 2016 &#32;to be at a level similar to the previous three years. 

Our estimate of the effects of complying with governmental pollution prevention and safety regulations is subject to: 

&#8226; 

potential changes in applicable statutes and regulations (or their enforcement and interpretation); 

&#8226; 

uncertainty as to the success of anticipated solutions to pollution problems; 

&#8226; 

uncertainty as to whether additional expense may prove necessary; and 

&#8226; 

potential for emerging technology to affect remediation methods and reduce associated costs. 

We are subject to liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damage, or natural resource damage arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances. Further, we may have environmental liabilities imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations. These liabilities may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss) and may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at an affected property. We are subject to many environmental laws, including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the United States, and similar foreign and state laws. 

Under CERCLA, we are currently considered a potentially responsible party (PRP), at several sites, ranging from a de minimis &#32;PRP or a minor PRP, to an involvement considered greater than the minor PRP involvement. At some of these sites, the remediation methodology, as well as the proportionate shares of each PRP, has been well established. Other sites are not as mature, which makes it more difficult to reasonably estimate our share of the future clean-up or remediation costs. 

In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named us as a PRP under Superfund law for the clean-up of soil and groundwater contamination at the five grouped disposal sites known as "Sauget Area 2 Sites" in Sauget, Illinois. Without admitting any fact, responsibility, fault, or liability in connection with this site, we are participating with other PRPs in site investigations and feasibility studies. In December 2013, the EPA issued its Record of Decision confirming its remedies for the selected Sauget Area 2 sites. We have accrued our estimated proportional share of the remedial costs and expenses addressed in the Record of Decision. We do not believe there is any additional information available as a basis for revision of the liability that we have established at December 31, 2015 . The amount accrued for this site is not material. We also have several other sites where we are in the process of environmental remediation and monitoring. See Note 17 &#32;for further information. 

Geographic Areas 

We have operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific, India, Latin America, and the Middle East. The economies are generally stable in the countries where we do most of our business, although many of those countries have experienced economic downturns in the past few years. In countries with more political or economic uncertainty, we generally minimize our risk of loss by utilizing U.S. Dollar-denominated transactions, letters of credit, and prepaid transactions. Our foreign customers consist of global, national, and independent oil companies, as well as financially viable state-owned organizations. 

The tables below report revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, as well as by country for those countries with significant revenues or long-lived assets. Since our foreign operations are significant to our overall business, we are also presenting revenue in the table below by the major regions in which we operate. NewMarket assigns revenues to geographic areas based on the location to which the product was shipped to a third party. Long-lived assets in the table below include property, plant, and equipment, net of depreciation. The change in revenues during the three-year period is discussed more fully in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Net sales to one customer of our petroleum additives segment exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue in 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Sales to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its affiliates (Shell) amounted to $261 million &#32;( 11% &#32;of consolidated revenue) in 2014 &#32;and $253 million &#32;( 11% &#32;of consolidated revenue) in 2013 . These sales represent a wide range of products sold to multiple Shell affiliates around the world. No customer exceeded 10% of net sales in 2015.
