 ITEM 1. Business 

The Company 

Crocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the "Company," "we," "our," or "us") are engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, worldwide marketing and distribution of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear featuring fun, comfort, color, and functionality. The Company, a Delaware corporation, is the successor of a Colorado corporation of the same name, and was originally organized in 1999 as a limited liability company. Our products include footwear and accessories that utilize our proprietary closed-cell resin, called Croslite, as well as casual lifestyle footwear that use a range of materials. Our Croslite material enables us to produce innovative, lightweight, non-marking, and odor-resistant footwear. We currently sell our products in more than 65 countries through domestic and international retailers and distributors, and directly to consumers through our company-operated retail stores, outlets, webstores, and kiosks. 

Since the initial introduction of our popular Beach and Crocs Classic designs in 2002, we have expanded our classic products to include a variety of new styles and products. Going forward, we are focusing on our core molded footwear heritage, as well as developing innovative casual lifestyle footwear. The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products to a wide range of distribution channels, including family footwear stores, department stores, sporting goods stores and traditional footwear retailers, as well as a variety of specialty and independent retail channels, and via the internet. 

Products 

Our product offerings have grown significantly since we first introduced the single-style clog in six colors in 2002. We currently offer a wide variety of footwear products including clogs, sandals, wedges, flats, sneakers, and boots. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 76.2%, 73.5%, and 71.1%, respectively, of unit sales consisted of products geared toward adults compared to 23.8%, 26.5%, and 28.9%, respectively, of unit sales of products geared toward children. 

A key differentiating feature of our footwear products is the Croslite material, which is uniquely suited for comfort and functionality. Croslite is carefully formulated to create extremely lightweight, comfortable, and non-marking footwear that conforms to the shape of the foot and increase comfort. Croslite is a closed-cell resin material which is water resistant, virtually odor free and allows many of our footwear styles to be cleaned simply with water. As we have expanded our product offering, we have incorporated traditional materials, such as textile fabric and leather, into many of our styles; however, we continue to utilize the Croslite material for the foot bed, sole, and other key structural components for many of these styles. 

We strive to provide our global consumer with a year-round product assortment featuring fun, comfortable, casual, colorful, and innovative styles. Our collections are designed to meet the needs of the family by focusing on key wearing occasions. Our goal is to deliver world-class product assortments for the family with all of the comfort features and benefits Crocs is known for. We have discontinued our non-core products in order to focus on growing our core-molded heritage category while developing more compelling casual footwear platforms. 

At the heart of our brand resides the Classic, our first and most iconic style for adults and kids that embodies our innovation in molding and design, delivers all-day comfort, and has established a new category in the footwear marketplace. The unique look and feel of the Classic can be experienced throughout our entire product line due to the use and design of our proprietary material Croslite. We have expanded our core molded product line, introduced in 2002, with the addition of dual density technology, warm lined styles, seasonal flips and slides. Licensed style partnerships from Disney, Marvel, Sanrio, 

Nickelodeon, and Warner Bros., among others, provide popularity to our kids' core line along with our kids-only product innovations, including lights, color-change materials, and interactive elements. 

In addition, we have extended our core product assortment with new styling including 'built for her' and 'built for him' silhouettes, which are offered in multiple color and graphic treatments. Our core products are available across a range of channels of distribution and span both stylish and active wearing occasions for the entire family. 

Sales and Marketing 

Each season we focus on presenting a compelling "brand story and experience" for our new product collections and our broader casual lifestyle assortment. Our marketing efforts center on story-telling across diverse wearing occasions and product silhouettes. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, total advertising costs were $58.2 million, $44.7 million, and $47.6 million, respectively. 

We run our business across three major regions: the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe. In developing our market growth and expansion strategy, we prioritize six core markets including: (i) the United States, (ii) Japan, (iii) China, (iv) South Korea, (v) Germany, and (vi) the United Kingdom. These countries have been identified as large-scale geographies where we believe the greatest opportunities for growth exist. Accordingly, our product development efforts for our 2016 product line are largely focused on expanding our market share in these locations. We are also focusing our marketing efforts on these regions in an effort to increase customer awareness of both our brand and our full product range. 

We have three primary sales channels: wholesale, retail, and e-commerce (discussed in more detail below). Our marketing efforts are aimed at driving business to both our wholesale partners and our company-operated retail and e-commerce stores. Our marketing efforts in the wholesale and retail channels are focused on visual product merchandising with alignment on key stories, activation materials, and creative materials. Retail stores provide a unique opportunity to engage with customers in a three-dimensional manner. Strong emphasis is placed on making the store experience a meaningful and memorable showcase of our larger assortment of casual lifestyle footwear and key new product launches. 

Wholesale Channel 

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 54.2%, 55.7%, and 56.5% of net revenues, respectively, were derived from sales through the wholesale channel which consists of sales to distributors and third-party retailers. Wholesale customers include family footwear retailers, national and regional retail chains, department stores, sporting goods stores, and independent footwear retailers. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues for any of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. 

Many of our agreements allow us to accept returns from wholesale customers for defective products and quality issues, on an exception basis, and to extend pricing discounts in lieu of defective product returns. We also may accept returns from our wholesale customers, on an exception basis, for the purpose of stock re-balancing to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments. 

We use third-party distributors in select markets where we believe such arrangements are preferable to direct sales. These third-party distributors purchase products pursuant to a price list and are granted the right to resell the products in a defined territory, usually a country or group of countries. Our typical distribution agreements have terms of one to four years, are generally terminable upon 30 days prior notice, and have minimum sales requirements that allow us to terminate or renegotiate the contract if minimum requirements are not met. 

Retail Channel 

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 34.7%, 35.5%, and 35.0%, respectively, of our net revenues were derived from sales through our retail channel. We operate our retail channel through three integrated platforms: full-service retail locations, outlet locations, and kiosk/store-in-store locations. Our three types of store platforms enable us to organically promote the breadth of our product offering in high-traffic, highly visible locations. Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores. We will continue to moderate the pace of our retail expansion in 2016 with a focus on outlet locations as well as enhancing the profitability of existing locations. We opened 42 company-operated stores during the year ended December 31, 2015 and closed 68 company-operated stores. As retail store performance will vary in new and existing markets due to many factors, including maturity of the market and brand recognition, we periodically evaluate the fixed assets and leasehold improvements related to our retail locations for impairment. 

&#149; Full-Service Retail Locations Our company-operated retail locations allow us to effectively showcase the full extent of our new and existing products to customers at retail pricing. In addition, our full-service retail locations enable us to interact with our customers on a personal level in order to ensure a satisfying shopping experience. On average, the optimal space for our retail locations is between approximately 1,500 and 1,800 square feet, depending on the geographic vicinity of the property, and is typically located in high-traffic shopping malls or districts. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed 51 stores and opened 15 new stores. As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we operated 275, 311, and 327 global full-service retail stores, respectively. 

&#149; Outlet Locations Our company-operated outlet locations allow us to sell discontinued and overstock merchandise directly to consumers at discounted prices. We also sell full priced products in certain of our outlet stores. Outlet locations follow a similar size model as our full-service retail stores; however, they are generally located within outlet shopping locations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed four outlet locations and opened 16 new outlet locations. As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we operated 186, 174, and 170 global outlet stores, respectively. 

&#149; Kiosk / Store-in-Store Locations Our company-operated kiosks and store-in-store locations allow us to market specific product lines with the further flexibility to tailor products to consumer preferences in shopping malls and other high foot traffic areas. With bright and colorful displays, efficient use of retail space, and limited capital investment, we believe that kiosks and shop in shops locations can be an effective outlet for marketing our products where this business model is applicable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we closed 13 kiosk and store-in-store locations and opened 11 new kiosk and store-in-store locations. As of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we operated 98, 100, and 122 global kiosks and store-in-stores, respectively. 

The following table illustrates the net change in 2015 with respect to the number of our company-operated retail locations by reportable operating segment and country:

(1) Our South Africa operations were designated as held for sale as of December 31, 2015. These locations were subsequently sold on January 19, 2016. See Note 5&#151;Property and Equipment and Note 21&#151;Subsequent Events to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

E-commerce Channel 

As of December 31, 2015, we offered our products through 12 company-operated e-commerce webstores worldwide. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 11.1%, 8.8%, and 8.5%, respectively, of our net revenues were derived from sales through our e-commerce channel. Our e-commerce presence enables us to have increased access to our customers and provides us with an opportunity to educate them about our products and brand. Improving our e-commerce capabilities is one of our key strategies in positioning Crocs for sustained growth. Going forward, we will continue to improve our consumer's online experience and look for new ways to leverage digital technologies to connect with them. 

Business Segments and Geographic Information 

For 2015, we had three reportable operating segments based on the geographic nature of our operations: Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe. We also have an "Other businesses" category which aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable segment threshold and represents manufacturing operations located in Mexico, Italy and Asia. For 2014 and 2013, we had four reportable operating segments: Americas, Asia Pacific, Japan and Europe. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, Crocs' internal reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") began consolidating Japan into the Asia Pacific segment. This change aligned the Company's internal reporting to its new strategic model and management structure, as Japan and Asia Pacific are now managed and analyzed as one operating segment by management and the CODM. Accordingly, prior period segment results have been reclassified to reflect this change. The composition of our reportable operating segments is consistent with that used by our CODM to evaluate performance and allocate resources. See additional discussion of our segments including results of operations and assets by segment in Note 18 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Americas 

The Americas segment consists of revenues and expenses related primarily to product sales in the North and South America geographic regions. Regional wholesale channel customers consist of a broad range of family footwear, sporting goods and department stores as well as specialty retailers and distributors. The regional retail channel sells directly to consumers through 196 company-operated store locations in the Americas as well as through webstores. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, revenues from the Americas segment constituted approximately 43.7%, 40.9%, and 41.9% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. Specifically, revenues from the United States of America constituted approximately 35.8%, 36.3%, and 33.7% of our consolidated revenues, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. 

Asia Pacific 

The Asia Pacific segment consists of revenues and expenses related primarily to product sales throughout Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East and South Africa. The Asia Pacific wholesale channel consists of sales to a broad range of retailers similar to the wholesale channel we have established in the Americas segment. We also sell products directly to the consumer through 261 company-operated stores located in Asia as well as through our webstores. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, revenues from the Asia segment constituted 39.0%, 39.6%, and 40.0%, of our consolidated revenues, respectively. 

Europe 

The Europe segment consists of revenues and expenses related primarily to product sales throughout Europe and Russia. The Europe segment wholesale channel customers consist of a broad range of retailers, similar to the wholesale channel we have established in the Americas segment. We also sell our products directly to the consumer through 102 company-operated stores located in Europe as well as through our webstores. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, revenues from the Europe segment constituted 17.3%, 19.5%, and 18.1% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. 

Distribution and Logistics 

On an ongoing basis, we look to enhance our distribution and logistics network to further streamline our supply chain, increase our speed to market, and lower operating costs. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we stored our raw material and finished goods inventories in company-operated warehouse and distribution facilities located in the United States, Mexico, the Netherlands, Japan, 

Finland, South Africa, Russia, and Italy. We also utilize distribution centers which are operated by third parties located in the United States, China, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Korea, Singapore, India, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Puerto Rico, and Italy. Throughout 2015, we continued to engage in efforts to consolidate our global warehouse and distribution facilities to facilitate a lean cost structure. As of December 31, 2015, our company-operated warehouse and distribution facilities provided us with approximately 1.0 million square feet and our third-party operated distribution facilities provided us with approximately 0.4 million square feet. We also ship a portion of our products directly to our customers from our internal and third-party manufacturers. 

Raw Materials 

"Croslite", our branded proprietary closed-cell resin, is the primary raw material used in the majority of our footwear and some of our accessories. Croslite is soft, durable, and allows our material to be non-marking in addition to being extremely lightweight. We continue to invest in research and development in order to refine our materials to enhance these properties and to target the development of new properties for specific applications. 

Croslite material is produced by compounding elastomer resins that we or one of our third-party processors purchase from major chemical manufacturers, together with certain other production inputs such as color dyes. At this time, we have identified multiple suppliers that produce the elastomer resins used in the Croslite material. We may, however, in the future identify and utilize materials produced by other suppliers as an alternative to, or in addition to, the elastomer resins we currently use in the production of our proprietary material. All of the other raw materials that we use to produce the Croslite products are readily available for purchase from multiple suppliers. 

Since our inception, we have substantially increased the number of footwear products we offer. Many of these new products are constructed using leather, textile fabrics, or other non-Croslite materials. We, or our third-party manufacturers, obtain these materials from a number of third-party sources and we believe these materials are broadly available. We also outsource the compounding of the Croslite material and continue to purchase a portion of our compounded raw materials from a third party in Europe. 

Design and Development 

We continue to dedicate significant resources to product design and development as we expand the footwear styles we offer based on opportunities we identify in the marketplace. Our design and development process is highly collaborative and we continually strive to improve our development function so we can bring products to market quickly and at reduced costs, while maintaining product quality. We spent $14.0 million, $16.7 million, and $15.4 million in research, design, and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Manufacturing and Sourcing 

Our strategy is to maintain a flexible, globally diversified, low-cost manufacturing base. We currently have company-operated production facilities in Mexico and Italy. We also contract with third-party manufacturers to produce certain of our footwear styles or to provide support to our internal production processes. Our internal manufacturing capabilities enable us to rapidly make changes to production, providing us with the flexibility to quickly respond to orders for high demand models and colors throughout the year, while outsourcing allows us to capitalize on the efficiencies and cost benefits of using contracted manufacturing services. We believe this strategy will continue to minimize our production costs, increase overall operating efficiencies, and shorten production and development times. 

In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we manufactured approximately 11.3%, 13.9%, and 15.1%, respectively, of our footwear products internally. We sourced the remaining footwear production from multiple third-party manufacturers primarily in China, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and 

South America. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our largest third-party manufacturer in China produced approximately 26.6%, 27.5%, and 28.0%, respectively, of our footwear unit volume. We do not have written supply agreements with our primary third-party manufacturers in Asia. 

Intellectual Property and Trademarks 

We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, trade dress and patent protections to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in our product designs, brands, materials, and research and development efforts, although no such methods can afford complete protection. We own or license the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution, and sale of all of our products, both domestically and internationally, in most countries where our products are currently either sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the Crocs logo and the Crocs word mark, both of which are registered or pending registration in the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, China, and Canada among other places. We also have registrations or pending trademark applications for the marks Jibbitz, Jibbitz Logo, YOU by Crocs, YOU by Crocs Logo, Tail Logo, Bite, Bite Logo, Crocband, Crocs Tone, and Crocs Littles, "Croslite" and the Croslite logo, as well as other marks in various countries around the world. 

In the U.S., our patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of the filing of the patent application. Our trademarks registered within and outside of the U.S. are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to become generic. We believe our trademarks are crucial to the successful marketing and sale of our products. We will continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, the trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. We will also continue to aggressively police our patents, trademarks and copyrights and pursue those who infringe upon them, both domestically and internationally, as we deem necessary. 

We consider the formulations of the materials covered by our trademark Croslite and used to produce our shoes to be a valuable trade secret. Croslite material is manufactured through a process that combines a number of components in various proportions to achieve the properties for which our products are known. We use multiple suppliers to source these components but protect the formula by using exclusive supply agreements for key components, confidentiality agreements with our third-party processors, and by requiring our employees to execute confidentiality agreements concerning the protection of our confidential information. Other than our third-party processors, we are unaware of any third party using our formula in the production of shoes. We believe the comfort and utility of our products depend on the properties achieved from the compounding of Croslite material and constitute a key competitive advantage for us, and we intend to continue to vigorously protect this trade secret. 

We also actively combat counterfeiting through monitoring of the global marketplace. We use our employees, sales representatives, distributors, and retailers, as well as outside investigators and attorneys, to police against infringing products by encouraging them to notify us of any suspect products and to assist law enforcement agencies. Our sales representatives and distributors are also educated on our patents, pending patents, trademarks and trade dress to assist in preventing potentially infringing products from obtaining retail shelf space. The laws of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as do the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, we may have difficulty obtaining legal protection for our intellectual property in certain foreign jurisdictions. 

Seasonality 

Due to the seasonal nature of our footwear, which is more heavily focused on styles suitable for warm weather, revenues generated during our fourth quarter is typically less than revenues generated during our first three quarters, when the northern hemisphere is experiencing warmer weather. We continue to 

expand our product line to include more winter oriented styles to reduce the seasonality of our revenues. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of new model introductions, or general economic, or consumer confidence. Accordingly, results of operations and cash flows for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of expected results for any other quarter or for any other year. 

Backlog 

We receive a significant portion of orders from our wholesale customers and distributors that remain unfilled as of any date and, at that point, represent orders scheduled to be shipped at a future date. We refer to these unfilled orders as backlog, which can be canceled by our customers at any time prior to shipment. Backlog only relates to wholesale and distributor orders for the next season and current season fill-in orders and excludes potential sales in our retail and internet channels. Backlog as of a particular date is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, manufacturing schedule and the timing of product shipments. Further, the mix of future and immediate delivery orders can vary significantly period over period. Backlog also is affected by the timing of customers' orders and product availability. Due to these factors and business model changes around the globe, we believe backlog is an imprecise indicator of future revenues that may be achieved in a fiscal period and cannot be relied upon. 

Foreign Currency Fluctuations on Revenues and Operating Income (Loss) 

As a global company, we have significant revenues, costs, assets, liabilities and intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Accordingly, any amounts recorded in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting and are impacted by foreign currency fluctuations. While we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges to reduce our exposure to changes in exchange rates, the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy and our forward contracts may not prove effective in reducing our exposures. 

Competition 

The global casual, athletic and fashion footwear markets are highly competitive. Although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company with respect to the entire spectrum of our products, we believe portions of our wholesale, retail, and ecommerce businesses compete with companies including, but not limited to, Deckers Outdoor Corp., Skechers USA Inc., Steve Madden, Ltd., Wolverine World Wide, Inc. and VF Corporation. Our company-operated retail locations also compete with footwear retailers such as Genesco, Inc., Macy's, Dillard's, Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., The Finish Line Inc., and Footlocker, Inc. 

The principal elements of competition in these markets include brand awareness, product functionality, design, quality, pricing, customer service, and marketing and distribution. We believe that our unique footwear designs, the Croslite material, our prices, our expanded product line, and our distribution network continue to position us well in the marketplace. However, a number of companies in the casual footwear industry have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with wholesalers, longer operating histories, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition and greater marketing resources than we have. Furthermore, we face competition from new players who have been attracted to the market with products similar to ours as the result of the unique design and success of our footwear products. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 5,400 full-time, part-time, and seasonal employees, of which approximately 3,600 were engaged in retail-related functions.
