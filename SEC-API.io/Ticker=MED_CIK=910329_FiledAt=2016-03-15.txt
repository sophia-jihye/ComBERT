MARKETS

&#160;

Over the past 30 years, obesity in the United States has risen dramatically. In 2013, the American Medical Association officially declared obesity a disease and The American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and The Obesity Society recommended that obesity be managed as a chronic disease. Throughout the world, the World Health Organization estimates that approximately 1.9 billion people are overweight. In the United States, over two-thirds of the adult population fall within the overweight or obese categories. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;), over 78 million U.S. adults are obese.

&#160;

Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (&#8220;BMI&#8221;) of 30 kg/m 2 or greater, whereas overweight is defined as a BMI ranging between 25 and 29.9 kg/m 2 . All states in the United States had a prevalence of obesity of at least 20% in 2014. Furthermore, the CDC reported that forty-five states had adult obesity rates of 25% or higher, and twenty-two of these states had obesity rates at 30% or more. Being overweight and/or obese is linked to a multitude of serious comorbidities including heart disease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea and depression. A 2015 report by Trust for America&#8217;s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated 80% of people with diabetes are overweight or obese.

&#160;

The primary factors contributing to obesity, which are well known are: unhealthy food choices and lack of physical activity. Obesity is not limited to adults; the CDC has reported children and adolescents are also affected. According to the CDC, the prevalence of obesity in children age 6-11 years has doubled and obesity rates have quadrupled in adolescents age 12-19 years in the past 30 years. Approximately 18% of children and 21% of adolescents are obese and are at an increased risk of developing health problems such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and prediabetes.

&#160;

Studies completed by the CDC reported Americans incurred $147 billion in medical costs associated with obesity in 2008 and that the average annual medical costs for those who are obese are over $1,400 higher than those of people in normal weight ranges. The U.S. weight loss market itself is estimated to be a $65 billion per year industry, including consumer spending on diet foods, drinks and low-calorie sweeteners; health clubs and workout videos; medically supervised and commercial weight loss programs; children&#8217;s weight loss camps; diet books; appetite suppressants and more. Portion-controlled, meal-replacement weight management programs are continuing to gain popularity, as consumers search for a safe and effective solution that provides balanced nutrition, effective weight loss, and valuable behavior-modification education.

&#160;

&#160;

Medifast brand awareness has expanded through the Company&#8217;s marketing campaigns, improved product quality, and an emphasis on quality customer service, technical support, and publications developed by the Company&#8217;s marketing staff. Medifast products have been proven to be effective for weight loss and weight management in clinical studies conducted by researchers from leading universities.

&#160;

Take Shape For Life&#174; &#8211; Take Shape For Life is the personal coaching division of Medifast. This coaching network consists of independent contractor health coaches (&#8220;Health Coaches&#8221;), who are trained to provide coaching and support to clients utilizing the Take Shape For Life&#174; platform. The role of the Health Coach is to provide support and personal encouragement to help clients effectively reach and sustain a healthy weight, and adopt habits for a lifetime of health.

&#160;

Our Health Coaches provide coaching and support to their clients throughout the weight-loss and weight-maintenance process. Most new Health Coaches are introduced to the opportunity by an existing Health Coach. The vast majority of new Health Coaches started as weight-loss clients of a Health Coach, had success on the Take Shape For Life&#174; program, and became a Health Coach to help others through the weight-loss process.

&#160;

Take Shape For Life&#174; is a member of the Direct Selling Association (the &#8220;DSA&#8221;), a national trade association representing over 200 direct selling companies doing business in the United States. To become a member of the DSA, Take Shape For Life&#174;, like other active DSA member companies, underwent a comprehensive and rigorous one-year company review by DSA legal staff that included a detailed analysis of its company business-plan materials. This review is designed to ensure that a company&#8217;s business practices do not contravene DSA&#8217;s Code of Ethics. In addition to its DSA membership, Take Shape For Life is also a voluntary DSA Code of Ethics participant, which sets higher standards for ensuring compliance. Compliance with the requirements of the Code of Ethics is paramount to becoming and remaining a member in good standing of the DSA. Accordingly, we believe membership in DSA by Take Shape For Life&#174; demonstrates its commitment to the highest standards of ethics and a pledge not to engage in any deceptive, unlawful, or unethical business practices. Among those Code of Ethics proscriptions are pyramid schemes and endless chain schemes as defined by federal, state, or local laws. Moreover, Take Shape For Life&#174;, like other DSA member companies in good standing, has pledged to provide consumers with accurate and truthful information regarding the price, grade, quality, and performance of the products Take Shape For Life&#174; markets.

&#160; 

Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers &#8211; Franchise Medifast Weight Control Centers (&#8220;MWCC&#8221;) offer structured programs and a team of professionals to help customers achieve weight-loss and weight-management success at center locations. In 2008, MFSI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Medifast, began offering the center model as a franchise opportunity. MFSI currently offers the Medifast Weight Control Center franchise opportunity in most states under a registered (where required) franchise disclosure document (&#8220;FDD&#8221;). The MFSI Franchise Agreement requires franchisees to develop a minimum of three Medifast Weight Control Centers within a defined geographic area in the time frame set forth in the Development Agreement between MFSI and the franchisee. MFSI currently has franchised centers located in Arizona, California, Louisiana, Minnesota, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. As of December 31, 2015, 61 franchise locations were in operation.

MFSI currently offers the Medifast Weight Control Center franchise opportunity in most states under a registered (where required) franchise disclosure document (&#8220;FDD&#8221;). The MFSI Franchise Agreement requires franchisees to develop a minimum of three Medifast Weight Control Centers within a defined geographic area in the time frame set forth in the Franchise and Development Agreement between MFSI and the franchisee.

&#160;

MFSI&#8217;s franchise strategy depends on our franchisees&#8217; active involvement in, and management of, Medifast Weight Control Center operations. Candidates are reviewed for appropriate operational experience and financial stability, including specific net worth and liquidity requirements. Upon execution of the Franchise and Development Agreements, franchisees are required to promptly select sites for their Centers, each of which are subject to MFSI&#8217;s approval.

&#160;

A franchisee&#8217;s initial fee includes the franchise fee for their first Center to be developed and a non-refundable deposit for the second and third Centers to be developed, and covers the cost of MFSI resources provided for, among other things, the training of franchisees and their staff, and approval of the proposed territory for development. If a franchisee desires to open more than three Centers in the designated territory, there is an additional fee charged for each additional Center to be developed.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Prior to the opening of each Medifast Weight Control Center franchise established under the Franchise and Development Agreements, MFSI will do the following:

&#160;

i. designate the Center&#8217;s protected territory. &#160;

ii. review for approval the sites selected by the franchisee for the Center. &#160;

iii. review for approval the lease governing the location where the Center is to be located. &#160;

iv. provide the franchisee with standard plans and specifications for the build-out of the Center along with a list of equipment and improvements which the franchisee is required to purchase and install. &#160;

v. provide an initial training program. &#160;

vi. provide the franchisee on-site assistance and guidance for approximately three to five days on or about the opening of the Center. &#160;

vii. provide the franchisee with online access to a password-protected, electronic version of the Medifast Weight Control Centers&#174; Franchise Operations Manuals. &#160;

MFSI may, in certain limited circumstances, cause its affiliate to provide products at a discounted price. Medifast may, in certain circumstances guarantee a franchisee&#8217;s notes, leases or other obligations. MFSI does not offer direct or indirect financing.

&#160;

While MFSI does not currently have a purchase option included in its Franchise and Development Agreements, it does have the right of first refusal to acquire a Center if the franchisee wishes to sell a Center.

&#160;

Medifast Wholesale &#8211;Medifast medical provider practices carry an inventory of wholesale products and resell them to patients while providing appropriate medical monitoring, testing, and support to ensure healthy weight loss and weight management.

&#160;

The Company offers extensive resources to assist the medical providers, their staff and their patients in achieving success with their Medifast program. These medical providers have access to our nutrition support team, marketing assets and training modules to help grow their program and enable patients to achieve their weight loss and associated health goals. Medifast&#8217;s nutrition support team includes registered dietitians and a behavioral specialist who provide program support and advice via phone and email.

&#160;

In 2014, the Company began piloting an online offering that features a resource center to provide Medifast medical providers access to the most current product and program material to support their patients and their business. In addition to opening up the opportunity for current Medifast medical providers to incorporate an e-commerce solution into their Medifast offering, they now have access to online training, news and tips from Medifast, and customizable marketing material to help them reach more patients via our wholesale healthcare channel.

&#160;

In 2012, the Company entered into a 3-year strategic partnership with Medix, a leader in pharmaceutical obesity products in Mexico. The agreement granted Medix an exclusive license for the distribution of Medifast products and programs through physicians and weight control centers in Mexico under the Medifast brand. Inventory is shipped to Medix within the United States and the resulting revenues are classified as domestic sales for the Company.

&#160;

In January 2013, the Company and Medix, amended their agreement to provide an exclusive 5-year licensing agreement to increase distribution of Medifast meal replacement products and programs beyond Mexico and into Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, and Uruguay. In 2015, Medix operated one Medifast Weight Control Center in Mexico and launched their brand revitalization strategy with the opening of a 180 0 Center that features Medifast products and programs. Along with seven Slim Centers, Medix continued operations in nine total locations in Mexico.

&#160;

The Company recently started to expand its international presence into Canada.

&#160;

SEASONALITY 

&#160;

Sales of the Company's weight management products and programs have historically been seasonal. Traditionally, predisposition of consumers not to initiate a weight loss or management program during the holiday season impacts the fourth quarter with fewer sales of weight management products and services. January and February generally show increases in sales, as these months are considered the commencement of the &#8220;diet season.&#8221;

&#160;

SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD 

&#160;

Medifast has a Scientific Advisory Board that consists of a multi-disciplinary, international panel that serves as the foundation for scientifically-valid, consumer-centric, high quality innovations for lasting health. Its mission is to help guide Medifast in making informed decisions regarding medical, nutritional, and scientific matters by providing expertise and information on research and emerging trends.

&#160;

The work of this cross-disciplinary group builds on Medifast&#8217;s heritage of medically sound approaches to weight loss, and the incorporation of leading-edge clinical research into the Company&#8217;s products and programs. The Scientific Advisory Board is chaired by Lawrence Cheskin, M.D., F.A.C.P., associate professor of Health, Behavior, and Society at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director at Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center.

COMPETITION

&#160;

The weight-loss industry is very competitive and encompasses various weight loss products and programs. These include a wide variety of commercial weight-loss programs, pharmaceutical products, books, self-help diets, dietary supplements, appetite suppressants, and meal replacements, as well as, digital tools and wearable trackers. The weight loss market is served by a diverse array of competitors. Potential customers seeking to manage their weight can turn to other traditional center-based competitors, online diet oriented sites, self-directed dieting and self-administered products such as prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and supplements, as well as medically supervised programs.

&#160;

Medifast&#8217;s identified peers and competitors in the general health and wellness diet industry include NutriSystem Inc., Herbalife Ltd., USANA Health Sciences, and Weight Watchers International, Inc. The Company believes that it competes effectively in the weight-loss industry and differentiates itself from the competition.

&#160;

The Company believes its scientific and clinical heritage and commitment to evaluating its products and programs through clinical research are primary differentiators that allow it to compete in this market. Another primary differentiator is the Company&#8217;s unique multi-channel distribution strategy, which provides varying support modalities, and broadens the availability of the Medifast brand by targeting a customer&#8217;s individual needs. Originally developed by a physician, Medifast has been on the cutting edge in the development of nutritional and weight-management products since the Company was founded. Medifast meals are individually portioned, calorie- and carbohydrate-controlled meal replacements that share a similar nutritional &#8220;footprint&#8221; and provide a balance of protein and good carbohydrates, including fiber.

&#160;

Medifast Medical Providers offer Medifast products and programs to patients in their practice and utilize wholesale sales. Medifast Direct serves customers through the Medifast website and call center with various online support tools, along with access to registered dietitians. The Take Shape For Life&#174; division offers the personal support of a Health Coach that is often a person who has achieved success with Take Shape For Life&#174; and has turned their success into a business opportunity. Medifast Weight Control Centers offer a supervised and structured model for customers who prefer more accountability and personalized counseling as part of the ongoing program. Medifast weight management programs utilize meal replacements as part of a structured meal plan that clinical research has shown to be effective for weight loss.

&#160; 

MARKETING 

&#160;

In 2015, Medifast continued to build and leverage its core Medifast brand through multiple marketing strategies for each distinct distribution channel: Take Shape For Life&#174;, Medifast Direct, Medifast Weight Control Centers, and Medifast Wholesale. Customer acquisition and retention strategies vary by distribution channel and may include digital marketing, television advertising, public relations, social media, email marketing, events, and other means. These mediums were used to target new customers by stressing Medifast's and Take Shape For Life&#8217;s&#174; simple and effective approach to weight loss and management and long term health. Many of these programs were also utilized to reactivate, encourage and support existing customers and Health Coaches. Medifast and Take Shape For Life&#174; continues to enhance all company materials and websites.

&#160; 

MANUFACTURING 

&#160;

Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, manufactures and produces all Medifast powder-based products, which is approximately 42% of Medifast&#8217;s product revenues, in the manufacturing facility in Owings Mills, Maryland. The Company purchased the plant in July 2002 and has gradually increased production capacity and improved overall efficiencies with additional investments in blending and packaging equipment. The remaining 58% of Medifast products are manufactured by third party vendors in accordance with Medifast proprietary formulas and manufacturing standards. Our Owings Mills manufacturing facility is regulated and inspected by the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), the United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) and the Maryland State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. It is certified as a Safe Quality Food Program (SQF) Level 2 facility compliant with the Global Food Safety Initiative.

&#160;

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION HISTORY 

&#160;

The formulation, processing, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising and selling of the Company's products is subject to regulation by federal, state and local agencies. Products must comply with the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, State Consumer Protection laws and several other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable in localities in which the company products are made or are sold.

&#160;

The FDA and USDA and State and local Health departments are the major agencies whose regulatory mission is to assure that products are made using approved ingredients, manufacturing procedures and testing to ensure that safe quality products are delivered to consumers. The Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) has principal regulatory control over the Company&#8217;s advertising and trade practices, its enforcement powers are aimed at protecting the consumer from being deceived by unfair marketing and trading practices.

&#160;

The FTC has principal regulatory control over the Company&#8217;s advertising. Historically, the FTC has filed complaints against a number of commercial weight management providers alleging violations of federal law in connection with the use of advertisements that featured testimonials and claims for program success. In 2012, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a consent decree with the FTC regarding certain statements included in the advertising for the Company&#8217;s weight-loss programs. The consent decree requires us to comply with certain procedures and disclosures in connection with our advertisements of products and services.

&#160;

&#160;

PRODUCT LIABILITY AND INSURANCE 

&#160;

The Company, like other producers and distributors of ingested products, faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that, among other things, the use of its products results in injury. The Company maintains insurance against product liability claims with respect to the products it manufactures. With respect to the retail and direct marketing distribution of products produced by others, the Company's principal form of insurance consists of arrangements with each of its suppliers of those products to name the Company as beneficiary on each of such vendor's product liability insurance policies. The Company does not buy products from suppliers who do not maintain such coverage.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries employed 425 employees, of whom 182 were engaged in manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain support, and 243 in marketing, administrative, call center and corporate support functions. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with the Company. All employees are employed by Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

&#160;
