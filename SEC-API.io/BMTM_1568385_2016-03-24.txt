 ITEM 1. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

We are a media holding company for online assets primarily targeted to the military and public safety sectors. We generate revenue from two segments: product sales and services. Services include adverting revenue and subscriptions. We are dedicated to providing &#34;those that keep us safe&#34; places to go online where they can do everything from staying current on news and events affecting them, to looking for jobs, sharing information, communicating with the public, and purchasing products. We own and manage websites which are customized to provide our niche users, including active, reserve and retired military, law enforcement, first responders and other public safety employees with information and news that we believe may be of interest to them. 

Over the past three years we have experienced rapid visitor growth, including organic growth and growth through acquisitions. Annual visits to our websites have increased about 472% from approximately 840,000 in 2013 to approximately 40,471,000 in 2015.

Currently, in addition to our corporate website, www.brightmountainmedia.com , we own the following additional website properties which we have acquired between 2013 and February 2016:

We have several revenue streams generated directly from our websites. The revenue streams consist principally of product sales and advertising revenue, which is generated primarily through the display of paid listings as well as display advertisements appearing on our websites and subscriptions. We generate advertising revenue either directly from companies who pay us a monthly fee for advertising space, or by users &#147;clicking&#148; on website advertisements utilizing several ad network partners such as Google AdSense. We generate subscription revenues by the sale of access to career postings on one of our websites. The term of the subscriptions range from one month to 12 months and range in price from $8.95 to $77.00. Revenues are recognized, on a net basis, over the term of the subscription period. We generate product revenues by the sale of watches, clocks and apparel through our websites BrightWatches.com and Gopoliceblotter.com as well as through e-commerce distributor portals such as Amazon and eBay. Additionally, we expanded our product sales segment by adding a retail location in Delray Beach, FL in the fourth quarter of 2014. We believe that having a retail presence has allowed us to expand our product lines. 

BrightWatches.com and Gopoliceblotter.com are both fully active web-based &#147;stores&#148; wherein shoppers can purchase a variety of products including watches, clocks and apparel. We maintain an inventory of watches and clocks. Customers that purchase products from Brightwatches.com pay us directly in a fully enabled payment and checkout process that permits payments for purchases using credit cards through the Internet-based payment processing service PayPal. Our watches and clocks are also available for purchase through eBay and Amazon. Fulfillment of our orders of watches and clocks are either handled directly by Amazon when purchases are made through it or by us for purchases made through eBay or BrightWatches.com. Customers that purchase products from Gopoliceblotter.com pay us directly in a fully enabled payment and checkout process that permits payments for purchases using credit cards through the Internet-based payment processing service Stripe. Our apparel products are also available on Amazon. Fulfillment of orders of apparel are either handled directly by Amazon when purchases are made through it, by a third party fulfillment arrangement, or shipped by us.

&#160;

MilitaryStarter.com 

During September 2015 we launched www.MilitaryStarter.com , an online platform designed to help active duty military, veterans and their family members bring their dreams and ideas to fruition and receive support from the general public through crowdfunding campaigns. Active and retired military members and their families are able to use the portal to seek funds for a wide variety of purposes, including business ideas, community and personal needs, such as starting or expanding a new business, helping homeless veterans or providing funding for educational and health care needs. Creators are charged a small fee when registering a campaign and MilitaryStarter.com retains a customary percentage of the funds collected in the campaign. Unlike other crowdfunding sites, there are no minimum amounts which need to be raised for the creators to receive the funding. To further demonstrate our corporate commitment to the military community, MilitaryStarter.com will donate 10% of the revenue from the platform to select military non-profits that provide services and programs for active and veteran personnel, along with their families. We did not generate any meaningful revenues from this MilitaryStarter.com in 2015.

Secure email service 

&#160;

In December 2014 we expanded our online menu of services through the launch of the Bright Network Secure Email Service at www.thebrightnetwork.com . The features of this network include secure communication, no spam or unsolicited emails and private network user selection, among others. This private email service is available at the online Google Play Store with the offer of an Android app for phone and tablet users and the Apple App Store for iPhone. The cost is $99 a year. We did not generate any meaningful revenues from this service in 2015. 

Strategy: Build Scale and Monetize Traffic 

We focus our efforts in the target markets of military and public safety. Our business strategy requires us to continue to grow our business, operations and revenues both organically and through acquisitions. The key is to continue to rapidly grow our collective Internet traffic until such time as advertisers begin to think of Bright Mountain when they want to reach the military and public safety demographic. 

Strategic acquisitions of websites that are related to our core mission and niche demographic have been an instrumental part of our growth strategy. We believe that all of the programs and efforts to develop organic website traffic, and bring users and consumers to our websites, will continue to be enhanced through the addition of strategic acquisitions of other Internet properties. We are committed to adding to our website portfolio in 2016 and beyond with additional Internet properties that will fit strategically into our business objectives, subject to the availability of sufficient capital, so that we keep scaling up our website portfolio and increase our internet reach and traffic.

In the fourth quarter of 2015 we began to implement our strategic plan to develop and expand our sales and marketing efforts to start monetizing our rapidly growing website traffic. We believe the expenses associated with this initiative will be front-end loaded and will include long sales cycles.

We believe that digital marketing and advertising channels will experience budget increases where traditional print channels are likely to continue to see budget reductions. Management continues to focus its efforts on continued growth of our digital media reach through organic growth and acquisitions of strategic websites consistent with its niche market.

Key relationships 

We purchase a substantial amount of the products we sell through our websites from two vendors: Citizens Watch Company of America, Inc., and Bulova Corporation. These two vendors accounted for 34% and 26%, respectively, of total products purchased in 2015 and 51% and 28%, respectively, of total products purchased in 2014. We continue to expand our product lines by adding companies to our list of vendors. Although we continue to expand our product lines and vendor relationships, due to our high reliance on these two vendors, the loss of one of these vendors could adversely affect our operations.

We sell many of our products through various e-commerce distribution portals, which include Amazon and eBay. During 2015, these two portals accounted for 88% and 6%, respectively, of our total sales, and during 2014, these two portals accounted for 86% and 13%, respectively of our total product sales. A substantial amount of payments for our products sold are processed through PayPal and Stripe.

&#160;

We offer display advertising on our websites either though direct advertisements or through numerous third party providers, including Google AdSense. Google AdSense is a free service, which displays text or image ads that correspond to the keywords of the content of the page on which the ad is shown. Each time a user of a host website clicks on an AdSense advertisement, Google provides a flat fee to the operators of that website on behalf of the applicable advertiser. Approximately 36% of our 2015 total revenue from services came from Google AdSense as compared to 49% in 2014. From time-to-time Google may implement policy changes that could impact our ability to display ads. If our revenues from Google AdSense continues to increase in future periods, such potential policy changes could cause volatility in our advertising revenue and earnings. Although we continue to grow our direct advertisement revenue, and have developed new relationships with additional third-party providers, the loss of the access to Google AdSense could have an adverse effect on our business. 

Technology platforms 

One of our websites is hosted on Dreamhost, seven of our websites are hosted on Media Temple, and the remaining company-owned websites are hosted with WPEngine.

Competition 

The Internet and industries that operate through it are intensely competitive. We compete with other companies that have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and distribution resources. Our competitors include Yahoo and AOL for our homepage; Huffington Post and Foxnews.com for our news pages; and Amazon.com for shopping.

We believe that we can effectively compete in the market place for the following reasons:

&#183;

we have limited ourselves to certain niche, but significant and identifiable, markets;

&#183;

we have customized our website to the interests of our users and provide excellent content and news;

&#183;

our CEO, W. Kip Speyer, has had extensive entrepreneurial and management experience, including experience with public companies;

&#183;

we have a highly focused group of 20 people, which include writers, programmers, researchers and 27 direct full-time and part-time employees; and

&#183;

we are able to manage future growth without a substantial increase in our infrastructure.

Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources as well as greater experience in the industry than we have. There are no assurances we will ever be able to effectively compete in our marketplace. Our websites may not be competitive with other technologies and/or our websites may be displaced by newer technology. If this happens, our sales and revenues will likely decline. In addition, our current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with larger companies, to gain access to greater development or marketing resources. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share. 

Intellectual property 

We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. We own the following service marks and trademarks, which are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office:

trademarks and service marks are renewable for additional 10-year periods.

In addition to www.brightmountainmedia.com and www.thebright.com, we own multiple domain names that we may or may not operate in the future. However, as with phone numbers, we do not have and cannot acquire any property rights in an Internet address. The regulation of domain names in the United States and in other countries is also subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we might not be able to maintain our domain names or obtain comparable domain names, which could harm our business.

We may, from time to time, encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. Such claims may be with or without merit. Any litigation to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Furthermore, a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages. A judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from operating our business as it is presently conducted. Our business, consolidated operating results, and financial condition could be harmed if any of these events occurred. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending our company against infringement claims. In the event of a claim of infringement, we might be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties. We might be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost, if at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required licenses could harm our business, consolidated operating results and consolidated financial condition.

&#160;

Employees 

At March 14 2016, we had 23 full-time and four part-time employees. There are no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees.

Potential implications of the JOBS Act 

We are an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; under the provisions of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the &#147;JOBS&#148; Act.&#148; As part of the JOBS Act, companies with less than $1 billion in gross revenue can qualify as an &#147;emerging growth company.&#148; Therefore, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, and, as such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to:

&#160;

&#183;

not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes Oxley Act;

&#160;

&#183;

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic and annual reports;

&#160;

&#183;

not being required to comply with certain new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB; and

&#160;

&#183;

not being required to obtain shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

We have elected to take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations. Additionally, we qualify as a &#147;smaller reporting company&#148; under Federal securities laws and thus have the advantage of not being required to provide the same level of disclosure as larger public companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can elect to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to opt in to Section 107 and, therefore, will delay adoption of certain accounting standards applicable to public companies.

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a &#147;large accelerated filer&#148; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. At this time we expect to remain both a &#147;small reporting company&#148; and &#147;emerging growth company&#148; for the foreseeable future.

Government regulation 

Aspects of the digital marketing and advertising industry and how our business operates are highly regulated. We are subject to a number of domestic and, to the extent our operations are conducted outside the U.S., foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and through other electronic means, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In particular, we are subject to rules of the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and potentially other federal agencies and state laws related to our advertising content and methods, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, which establishes certain requirements for commercial electronic mail messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial electronic mail messages that follow a recipient&#146;s opt-out request or are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content, and federal and state regulations covering the treatment of member data that we collect from endorsers.

U.S. and foreign regulations and laws potentially affecting our business are evolving frequently. We currently have not developed our internal compliance program nor do we have policies in place to monitor compliance. Instead, we rely on the policies of our publishing partners. If we are unable to identify all regulations to which our business is subject and implement effective means of compliance, we could be subject to enforcement actions, lawsuits and penalties, including but not limited to fines and other monetary liability or injunction that could prevent us from operating our business or certain aspects of our business. In addition, compliance with the regulations to which we are subject now or in the future may require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our services. Any such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

&#160;

The FTC adopted Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising on October 5, 2009. These guides recommend that advertisers and publishers clearly disclose in third-party endorsements made online, such as in social media, if compensation was received in exchange for said endorsements. Because some of our marketing campaigns entail the engagement of consumers to refer other consumers in their social networks to view adds or take action, and both we and the consumer may earn cash and other incentives, any failure on our part to comply with these guides may be damaging to our business. We currently do not take any steps to monitor compliance with these guides. In the event of a violation, the FTC could potentially identify a violation of the guides, which could subject us to a financial penalty or loss of endorsers or advertisers.

In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California&#146;s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.

We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data. Any failure by us to comply with these privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the Internet is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our members&#146; privacy and data could result in a loss of member confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of members and customers, which could adversely affect our business.

Our subsidiary, The Bright Insurance Agency, LLC., is licensed by the State of Florida and function s as an independent agent offering life insurance, disability income insurance, and long-term care insurance. We have not generated any revenues from this subsidiary in 2015 or 2014.
