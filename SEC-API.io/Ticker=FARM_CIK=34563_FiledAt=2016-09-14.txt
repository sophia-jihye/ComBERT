Business 

Overview 

Farmer Bros. Co., a Delaware corporation (including its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;Farmer Bros.&#8221;), is a national coffee roaster, wholesaler and distributor of coffee, tea and culinary products. We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurant and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, hospitals, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee products. With a robust product line, including organic, Direct Trade, Direct Trade Verified Sustainable coffees or DTVS and other sustainably-produced coffees, iced and hot teas, cappuccino, spices, and baking/biscuit mixes, among others, we offer a comprehensive approach to our customers by providing not only a breadth of high-quality products, but also value-added services such as market insight, beverage planning, and equipment placement and service. We were founded in 1912, incorporated in California in 1923, and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004. We operate in one business segment. 

Corporate Relocation 

In an effort to make the Company more competitive and better positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities, in fiscal 2015 we began the process of relocating our corporate headquarters, product development lab, and manufacturing and distribution operations from Torrance, California to a new facility housing these operations currently under construction in Northlake, Texas (the &#8220;New Facility&#8221;). 

Closure and Sale of the Torrance Facility 

We began the process of closing our Torrance facility in the spring of 2015 in phases, as follows: 

&#8226; 

Manufacturing and Distribution. &#32;In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we transitioned our coffee roasting, grinding and packaging functions from our Torrance, California production facility and consolidated them with our Houston, Texas and Portland, Oregon production facilities, and moved our Houston distribution operations to our Oklahoma City, Oklahoma distribution center. 

&#8226; 

Corporate Headquarters . During the first half of fiscal 2016, we transferred our primary administrative offices from Torrance to temporary leased offices in Fort Worth, Texas near the New Facility, including the transfer or new hire of approximately 140 employees. 

&#8226; 

Sale of Spice Assets . In order to focus on our core product offerings, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the sale of certain assets associated with our manufacture, processing and distribution of raw, processed and blended spices and certain other culinary products (collectively, the &#8220;Spice Assets&#8221;) to Harris Spice Company Inc. (&#8220;Harris&#8221;). We provided certain post-closing transition services to Harris which concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The sale of the Spice Assets does not represent a strategic shift for us and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations because we will continue to sell a complete portfolio of spice and other culinary products purchased from Harris under a supply agreement to our direct-store-delivery, or DSD, customers. 

&#8226; 

Sale of the Torrance Facility. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell the Torrance facility. Subsequent to the fiscal year end, the sale of the Torrance facility closed on July 15, 2016. We have agreed to lease back the Torrance facility on a triple net basis through October 31, 2016, subject to two one-month extensions, at our option. As of June 30, 2016, the Torrance facility continued to house certain administrative functions and serve as a distribution facility and branch warehouse pending transition of the remaining Torrance operations to our other facilities. 

Construction of the New Facility 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into a lease agreement, (as amended the "Lease Agreement"), for the New Facility to be constructed by the lessor, at its expense. The Lease Agreement included an option to purchase the New Facility at a purchase price based on a percentage of the total project cost as of the closing date. In the fourth quarter of 

fiscal 2016, we exercised the purchase option to acquire the partially constructed New Facility with a targeted closing date in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Construction of and relocation to the New Facility are expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. 

Products 

We are a national coffee roaster, wholesaler and distributor of coffee, tea and culinary products manufactured under supply agreements, under our owned brands, as well as under private labels on behalf of certain customers. Our product categories consist of the following: 

&#8226; 

a robust line of roast and ground coffee, including organic, Direct Trade, DTVS and other sustainably-produced offerings; 

&#8226; 

frozen liquid coffee; 

&#8226; 

flavored and unflavored iced and hot teas; 

&#8226; 

culinary products including gelatins and puddings, soup bases, dressings, gravy and sauce mixes, pancake and biscuit mixes, jellies and preserves, and coffee-related products such as coffee filters, sugar and creamers; 

&#8226; 

spices; and 

&#8226; 

other beverages including cappuccino, cocoa, granitas, and ready-to-drink iced coffee. 

Our owned brand products are sold primarily into the foodservice channel. Our primary brands include Farmer Brothers&#8482;, Artisan Collection by Farmer Brothers&#8482;, Superior &#174; and Metropolitan&#8482;. Our Artisan coffee products include Direct Trade, Fair Trade Certified&#8482;, Rainforest Alliance Certified&#8482;, organic and proprietary blends. In addition, we sell whole bean and roast and ground flavored and unflavored coffee products under the Un Momento &#174; , Collaborative Coffee&#8482;, Cain's&#8482; and McGarvey &#174; &#32;brands at retail. Our roast and ground coffee products are sold in traditional packaging, including bags and fractional packages, as well as single-serve packaging. For a description of the amount of net sales attributed to each of our product categories in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations&#8212; Results of Operations &#32;included in Part II, Item 7 of this report. 

Business Strategy 

Overview 

We develop great tasting products delivered with concierge service with the goal of a positive impact on our customers and the planet. Through our sustainability, stewardship, environmental efforts, and leadership we are not only committed to serving the finest products available, considering the cost needs of the customer, but also insist on their sustainable cultivation, manufacture and distribution whenever possible. 

In order to achieve our mission, we have had to grow existing capabilities and develop new ones over the years. More recently, we have undertaken initiatives such as, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

develop new products in response to demographic and other trends to better compete in areas such as premium coffee and tea; 

&#8226; 

rethink aspects of our Company culture to improve productivity and employee engagement and to attract talent; 

&#8226; 

embrace sustainability across our operations, in the quality of our products, as well as, how we treat our coffee growers; and 

&#8226; 

ensure our systems and processes provide the highest quality products at a competitive cost, protection from cyber-risk, and a safe environment for our employees and partners. 

We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through our product offerings and through our customer service model, which includes: 

&#8226; 

a wide variety of coffee product offerings and packaging options across numerous brands and quality tiers; 

&#8226; 

beverage equipment placement and service; 

&#8226; 

hassle-free inventory and product procurement management; 

&#8226; 

DSD service; 

&#8226; 

merchandising support; and 

&#8226; 

product and menu insights. 

Our services are conducted primarily in person through Route Sales Representatives, or RSRs, who develop personal relationships with chefs, restaurant owners and food buyers at their delivery locations. We also provide comprehensive coffee programs to our national account customers, including private brand development, green coffee procurement, hedging, category management, sustainable sourcing and supply chain management. 

We distribute our owned brands primarily through our DSD network, while continuing to support and grow our private label and other national account business. Although currently a small portion of our distribution, we also distribute directly to consumers through our website and sell certain products such as Un Momento &#174; , Collaborative Coffee&#8482;, Cain's&#8482; and McGarvey &#174; &#32;at retail. 

Strategic Initiatives 

We are focused on the following strategies to reduce costs, streamline our supply chain, improve the breadth of products and services we provide to our customers, and better position the Company to attract new customers: 

Reduce Costs to Compete More Effectively 

&#8226; 

New Facility . In fiscal 2015, we commenced work on a corporate relocation plan to replace our aging production facility in Torrance, California with a more efficient, state-of-the-art facility to be located in Northlake, Texas. We undertook this endeavor, in part, to pursue improved production efficiency to allow us to provide a more cost-competitive offering of high-quality products. We believe the expected improvements in production efficiency, combined with the wind-down and sale of our Torrance facility, should allow us to operate at a lower cost, generally. 

&#8226; 

Third-Party Logistics . During the second half of fiscal 2016, we replaced our long-haul fleet operations with third-party logistics ("3PL"). We expect that this transportation arrangement will reduce our fuel consumption and empty trailer miles, while improving our intermodal and trailer cube utilization. 

&#8226; 

Vendor Managed Inventory. &#32;During the second half of fiscal 2016, we entered into a vendor managed inventory arrangement with a third party. We anticipate that the use of vendor managed inventory arrangements will result in a reduction in raw material, finished goods and logistics costs, while improving packaging innovation and fulfillment. 

&#8226; 

Warehouse Management . Subsequent to the fiscal year end, we entered into an agreement with a third party to provide warehouse management services for our New Facility. We expect the warehouse management services to facilitate cost savings by leveraging the third party's expertise in opening new facilities, implementing lean management practices, improving performance on certain key performance metrics, and standardizing best practices. 

Optimize Sales, Pricing and Portfolio of Products 

&#8226; 

Pricing and Products. &#32;In fiscal 2016, we built capability to more strategically optimize our pricing strategy across product, channel, customer and geographic segments. This process is designed to improve our average margins as well as retention rates. In addition, we continued our prior work optimizing SKU count and identifying opportunities to consolidate suppliers to improve costs and supply chain efficiency. 

&#8226; 

DSD Reorganization. During the second half of fiscal 2016, we began to realign our DSD organization by undertaking initiatives intended to streamline communication and decision making, enhance branch organizational structure, and improve customer focus, including initiatives toward a comprehensive training program for all DSD team members to strengthen customer engagement. 

&#8226; 

Accelerate Customer Acquisition Efforts. &#32;In fiscal 2016, we executed a regional test of our first advertising and lead generation campaign designed to improve our new customer acquisition rate within our DSD network. 

Strategic Investment in Assets and Evaluation of Cost Structure 

&#8226; 

Asset Utilization. We continue to look for ways to deploy our personnel, systems, assets and infrastructure to create or enhance stockholder value. Areas of focus have included corporate staffing and structure, methods of procurement, logistics, inventory management, supporting technology, and real estate assets. 

&#8226; 

Branch Consolidation and Property Sales . In an effort to streamline our branch operations, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we sold two Northern California branch properties, with a third Northern California property under contract for sale, and we acquired a new branch facility in Hayward, California. 

&#8226; 

Acquisitions. &#32;One of our investment priorities is exploring acquisitions that we believe will enhance long-term stockholder value and complement or enhance our product, equipment, service and/or distribution offerings to existing and new customer bases. For example, on September 9, 2016, through a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of China Mist Brands, Inc., dba China Mist Tea Company ("China Mist") for an aggregate purchase price of $11.3 million, with $10.8 million to be paid in cash at closing and $0.5 million to be paid as earnout if certain sales levels are achieved in the calendar years of 2017 and 2018. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We anticipate that the acquisition of China Mist will give us a greater presence in the high-growth premium tea industry. See Note 24 , Subsequent Events , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

Corporate Capabilities and Alignment to Create Stockholder Value 

&#8226; 

Investment in Human Resources. &#32;In fiscal 2016, we hired Isaac N. Johnston, Jr. as our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer and Carolyn Suzanne Gargis as our VP of Human Relations. Each of these individuals brings a proven track record at both large consumer packaged goods operations as well as experience in dealing with smaller and more entrepreneurial companies. In addition, in fiscal 2016, we continued to emphasize greater alignment of employee individual goals with Company goals under our compensation plans in order to focus the entire organization on the effort to create value for our stockholders. 

Drive High-Growth Product Categories and Address Broader Customer Needs 

&#8226; 

Introduction of Collaborative Coffee&#8482; and Redesign of Un Momento &#174; Branded Retail Products. &#32;In an effort to address what we believe to be unmet consumer needs and improve margin within the retail grocery environment, in fiscal 2016 we launched the Collaborative Coffee &#8482; &#32;brand into the retail grocery channel and completed a packaging redesign and product portfolio optimization of our Un Momento &#174; retail branded product line. Collaborative Coffee&#8482; offers coffee enthusiasts a super-premium, verified direct trade coffee at an approachable price. Un Momento &#174; &#32;delivers Millennial Hispanic consumers appealing flavor variety and premium coffee at an exceptional value. 

Expand Sustainability Leadership 

&#8226; 

Sustainability. &#32;We believe that our collective efforts in measuring our social and environmental impact, creating programs for waste, water and energy reduction, promoting partnerships in our supply chain that aim at supply chain stability and food security, and focusing on employee engagement place us in a unique position to help retailers and foodservice operators create differentiated coffee programs that can include sustainable supply chains, direct trade purchasing, training and technical assistance, recycling and composting networks, and packaging material reductions. During fiscal 2016, we submitted our second third-party verified Carbon Disclosure Project survey for Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (direct emissions, indirect emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam and other indirect emissions). Further, we published a sustainability report based on the Global Reporting Initiative&#8217;s compliance standard. 

&#8226; 

LEED &#174; &#32;Certified Facilities. &#32;Our Portland production and distribution facility was one of the first in the Northwest to achieve LEED &#174; Silver Certification. We anticipate that our corporate offices at the New Facility will also be LEED &#174; certified. 

&#8226; 

Expansion of Direct Trade Verified Sustainable Program. &#32;In fiscal 2016, we completed our first third-party audit and verification of our DTVS program for sourcing green coffee. DTVS is an impact-based product or raw material sourcing framework that utilizes data-based sustainability metrics to influence an inclusive, collaborative approach to sustainability along the supply chain. To evaluate whether coffee is DTVS, we follow an outcome-based evaluation framework. The outcome of this evaluation weighs on where we invest our resources within our supply chain and has led to an increased level of transparency for us. DTVS represents a growing percentage of our coffee portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Green Coffee Traceability. We are committed to the inclusion of more sustainably-sourced coffees in our supply chain. Regulatory and reputational risks can increase when customers, roasters and suppliers cannot see back into their supply chain. To address these concerns, as well as to deepen our commitment to the longevity of the coffee industry, in fiscal 2016 we began requiring our immediate suppliers of green coffee to enhance their reporting of traceability information on each lot of coffee sold to us. 

Charitable Activities 

We view charitable involvement as a part of our corporate responsibility and sustainability model: Social, Environmental, and Economic Development, or SEED. We endorse and support communities where our customers, employees, businesses, and suppliers are located, and who have enthusiastically supported us over the past 100 years. Our objective is to provide support toward a mission of supply chain stability with a focus on food security. 

Recipient organizations include those with strong local and regional networks that ensure that families have access to nutritious food. Donations may take the form of corporate cash contributions, product donations, employee volunteerism, and workplace giving (with or without matching contributions). 

&#8226; 

Recipient organizations include Feeding America, Mercy Corps, Ronald McDonald House, and local food banks. 

&#8226; 

We support industry organizations such as World Coffee Research, which commits to grow, protect, and enhance supplies of quality coffee while improving the livelihoods of the families who produce it, and the Specialty Coffee Association of America ("SCAA") Sustainability Council and the Coalition for Coffee Communities, which are focused on sustainability in coffee growing regions. 

&#8226; 

Our employee-driven CAF&#201; Crew organizes employee involvement at local charities and fund raisers, including running in the Chicago Marathon in support of Team Ronald McDonald House, riding in the Ride Against Hunger supported by Tarrant Area Food Bank, supporting delivery for Meals on Wheels, and hosting local food drives. 

&#8226; 

All of our usable and near expiring products or products with damaged packaging are donated to Feeding America affiliated food banks nationwide, in an effort to fully eliminate edible food waste from the landfill. 

Industry and Market Leadership 

We have made the following investments in an effort to ensure we are well-positioned within the industry to take advantage of category trends, industry insights, and general coffee and tea knowledge to grow our business: 

&#8226; 

Coffee Industry Leadership. Through our dedication to the craft of sourcing, blending and roasting coffee, and our participation and/or leadership positions with the SCAA, National Coffee Association, Coalition for Coffee Communities, International Women's Coffee Alliance, International Foodservice Manufacturers Association, Pacific Coast Coffee Association, Roasters Guild and World Coffee Research, we work to help shape the future of the coffee industry. We believe that due to our commitment to the industry, large retail and foodservice operators are drawn to working with us. We were among the first coffee roasters in the nation to receive SCAA certification of a state-of-the-art coffee lab and operate Public Domain &#174; , a specialty coffeehouse in Portland, Oregon. Upon completion, we plan to submit our product development lab at the New Facility for SCAA certification. 

&#8226; 

Market Insight and Consumer Research. We have developed a market insight capability internally that reinforces our business-to-business positioning as a thought leader in the coffee industry. We provide trend insights that help our customers create winning products and integrated marketing strategies for their own coffee brands. 

Within this, we are focused on understanding key demographic groups such as Millennials and Hispanics, and key channel trends. 

Raw Materials and Supplies 

Our primary raw material is green coffee, an agricultural commodity traded on the Commodities and Futures Exchange that is subject to price fluctuations. Over the past five years, coffee &#8220;C&#8221; market price per pound ranged from approximately $1.02 to $2.90. The coffee &#8220;C&#8221; market price as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.46 &#32;and $1.32 &#32;per pound, respectively. Our principal packaging materials include cartonboard, corrugated and plastic. We also use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas, and other energy sources to operate our production and distribution facilities. 

We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee regions around the world. Although coffee &#8220;C&#8221; market prices in fiscal 2016 were relatively low compared to historical levels, there can be no assurance that green coffee prices will remain at these levels in the future. Some of the Arabica coffee beans we purchase do not trade directly on the commodity markets. Rather, we purchase these coffee beans on a negotiated basis from coffee brokers, exporters and growers, including Direct Trade, DTVS and Fair Trade Certified&#8482; sources and Rainforest Alliance Certified&#8482; farms. Fair Trade Certified&#8482; provides an assurance that farmer groups are receiving the Fair Trade minimum price and an additional premium for certified organic products through arrangements with cooperatives. Direct Trade and DTVS products provide similar assurance except that the arrangements are provided directly to farmers instead of through cooperatives in an effort to promote investment in better and more sustainable farming practices as well as to ensure a fairer price. Rainforest Alliance Certified&#8482; coffee is grown using methods that help promote and preserve biodiversity, conserve scarce natural resources, and help farmers build sustainable lives. Our business model strives to reduce the impact of green coffee price fluctuations on our financial results and to protect and stabilize our margins, principally through customer arrangements and derivative instruments, as further explained in Note 7 , Derivative Instruments , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

Intellectual Property 

We own a number of United States trademarks and service marks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also own other trademarks and service marks for which we have filed applications for U.S. registration. We have licenses to use certain trademarks outside of the United States and to certain product formulas, all subject to the terms of the agreements under which such licenses are granted. We believe our trademarks and service marks are integral to customer identification of our products. It is not possible to assess the impact of the loss of such identification. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. In addition, we own numerous copyrights, registered and unregistered, registered domain names, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other proprietary rights that are not registered. 

Seasonality 

We experience some seasonal influences. The winter months are generally the strongest sales months. However, our product line and geographic diversity provide some sales stability during the warmer months when coffee consumption ordinarily decreases. Additionally, we usually experience an increase in sales during the summer and early fall months from seasonal businesses located in vacation areas and from grocery retailers ramping up inventory for the winter selling season. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 

Distribution 

We operate production facilities in Portland, Oregon and Houston, Texas. Distribution takes place out of our Portland facility as well as three separate distribution centers in Northlake, Illinois; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Moonachie, New Jersey. As of June 30, 2016, the Torrance facility continued to house certain administrative functions and serve as a distribution facility and branch warehouse pending transition of the remaining Torrance operations to our other facilities. Upon completion, the New Facility will serve as a production facility and distribution center for our products. Our products reach our customers primarily in two ways: through our nationwide DSD network of 450 &#32;delivery routes and 109 &#32;branch warehouses as of June 30, 2016, or direct-shipped via common carriers or third-party distributors. 

DSD sales are made &#8220;off-truck&#8221; to our customers at their places of business by our RSRs who generally are responsible for soliciting, selling and collecting from and otherwise maintaining our customer accounts. Our DSD business includes office coffee services whereby we provide office coffee products, including a variety of coffee brands and blends, brewing and beverage equipment, and foodservice supplies directly to offices. We operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles to distribute and deliver our products, and we rely on 3PL service providers for our long-haul distribution. We maintain inventory levels at each branch warehouse to promote minimal interruption in supply. We also sell directly to consumers through our website. 

Customers 

We serve a wide variety of customers, from small independent restaurants and foodservice operators to large institutional buyers like restaurant and convenience store chains, hotels, casinos, hospitals, and gourmet coffee houses, as well as grocery chains with private brand and consumer-branded coffee products. Although no single customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years, we have several large national account customers, the loss of or reduction in sales to one or more of which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During fiscal 2016, our top five customers accounted for approximately 19% of our net sales. 

Most of our customers rely on us for distribution; however, some of our customers use third-party distribution or conduct their own distribution. Some of our customers are &#8220;price&#8221; buyers, seeking the low-cost provider with little concern about service, while others find great value in the service programs we provide. We offer a full return policy to ensure satisfaction and extended terms for those customers who qualify. 

Competition 

The coffee industry is highly competitive, including with respect to price, product quality, service, convenience and innovation, and competition could become increasingly more intense due to the relatively low barriers to entry. We face competition from many sources, including the institutional foodservice divisions of multi-national manufacturers of retail products many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do, such as The J.M. Smucker Company (Folgers Coffee), Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company (Maxwell House Coffee) and Massimo Zanetti Beverage, wholesale foodservice distributors such as Sysco Corporation and US Foods, regional institutional coffee roasters such as S&#38;D Coffee &#38; Tea (Cott Corporation) and Boyd Coffee Company, and specialty coffee suppliers such as Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., Rogers Family Company, Distant Lands Coffee, Mother Parkers Tea &#38; Coffee Inc., Starbucks Corporation and Peet&#8217;s Coffee &#38; Tea. As many of our customers are small foodservice operators, we also compete with cash and carry and club stores (physical and on-line) such as Costco, Sam&#8217;s Club and Restaurant Depot and on-line retailers such as Amazon. We also face competition from growth in the single-serve, ready-to-drink coffee beverage and cold-brewed coffee channels, as well as competition from other beverages, such as soft drinks (including highly caffeinated energy drinks), juices, bottled water, teas and other beverages. 

We believe our longevity, product quality and offerings, national distribution network, coffee industry and sustainability leadership, market insight, comprehensive approach to customer relationship management, and superior customer service are the major factors that differentiate us from our competitors. We compete well when these factors are valued by our customers, and we are less effective when only price matters. Our customer base is price sensitive, and we are often faced with price competition. 

Working Capital 

We finance our operations internally and through borrowings under our existing credit facility. For a description of our liquidity and capital resources, see Results of Operations &#32;and Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition &#32; included in Part II, Item 7 of this report and Note 18 , Other Current Liabilities , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our working capital needs are greater in the months leading up to our peak sales period during the winter months, which we typically finance with cash flows from operations. In anticipation of our peak sales period, we typically increase inventory in the first quarter of the fiscal year. We use various techniques including demand forecasting and planning to determine appropriate inventory levels for seasonal demand. 

Regulatory Environment 

The conduct of our businesses, including, among other things, the production, storage, distribution, sale, labeling, quality and safety of our products, and occupational safety and health practices, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States. Our facilities are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material legal proceedings arising under these regulations except as described in Note 22 , Commitments and Contingencies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 

Employees 

On June 30, 2016 , we employed 1,634 &#32;employees, 508 &#32;of whom are subject to collective bargaining agreements. 

Other 

The nature of our business does not provide for maintenance of or reliance upon a sales backlog. None of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government. We have no material revenues from foreign operations or long-lived assets located in foreign countries.
