General 

&#160; 

We are one of the leading commercial real estate finance companies in the United States, with a primary focus on multifamily lending. We have been in business for more than 78 years; a Fannie Mae DUS lender since 1988, when the DUS program began; a HUD lender since acquiring a HUD license in 2009; and a Freddie Mac Program Plus&#174; lender 

&#160;

since 2009. We originate, sell, and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate finance products and broker sales of multifamily properties. Our clients are owners and developers of commercial real estate across the country. We originate and sell multifamily loans through the programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and HUD. We retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans that we originate for the GSE and HUD programs. We are approved as a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (&#8220;DUS&#8221; &#8482;) lender nationally, a Freddie Mac Program Plus lender in 23 states and the District of Columbia, a Freddie Mac targeted affordable housing seller/servicer, a HUD Multifamily Accelerated Processing (&#8220;MAP&#8221;) lender nationally, a HUD Section 232 LEAN lender nationally, and a Ginnie Mae issuer. We broker and service loans for a number of life insurance companies, commercial banks, commercial mortgage backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) issuers, and other institutional investors, in which cases we do not fund the loan but rather act as a loan broker. We also originate and hold interim loans on our balance sheet and offer a proprietary CMBS platform. We offer investment sales brokerage services, with a primary focus in the southeastern United States. 

&#160; 

Walker &#38; Dunlop, Inc. is a holding company, and we conduct substantially all of our operations through Walker &#38; Dunlop, LLC, our operating company. In December 2010, we completed our initial public offering. In connection with our initial public offering, we completed certain formation transactions through which Walker &#38; Dunlop, LLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Walker &#38; Dunlop, Inc., a newly formed Maryland corporation. 

&#160; 

Our Product and Service Offerings 

&#160; 

We originate, sell, and service a range of multifamily and other commercial real estate financing products, including Multifamily Finance, FHA Finance, Capital Markets, and Proprietary Capital. Our clients are developers and owners of real estate across the United States. We focus primarily on multifamily properties and offer a range of commercial real estate finance products to our customers, including first mortgage loans, second trust loans, supplemental financings, construction loans, mezzanine loans, and bridge/interim loans. We originate and sell loans under the programs of the GSEs and HUD. We also originate loans for our own balance sheet and loans that we intend to contribute to securitizations led by large institutional investors. We retain servicing rights and asset management responsibilities on substantially all loans made under the GSE and HUD programs and some of the loans that we place with institutional investors. Our long-established relationships with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, HUD, and institutional investors enable us to offer this broad range of loan products and services. We provide investment sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily properties. Each of our product offerings is designed to maximize our ability to meet client needs, source capital, and grow our commercial real estate finance business. 

&#160; 

The sale of each loan through the GSE and HUD programs is negotiated prior to rate locking the loan with the borrower. For loans originated pursuant to the Fannie Mae DUS program, we generally are required to share the risk of loss, with our maximum loss capped at 20% of the loan amount at origination. In addition to our risk-sharing obligations, we may be obligated to repurchase loans that are originated for the GSE and HUD programs if certain representations and warranties that we provide in connection with such originations are breached. We have never been required to repurchase a loan. We have established a strong credit culture over decades of originating loans and are committed to disciplined risk management from the initial underwriting stage through loan payoff. 

&#160; 

Multifamily Finance 

&#160; 

We are one of 25 approved lenders that participate in Fannie Mae&#8217;s DUS program for multifamily, manufactured housing communities, student housing, affordable, and certain seniors housing properties. Under the Fannie Mae DUS program, Fannie Mae has delegated to us responsibility for ensuring that the loans we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program satisfy the underwriting and other eligibility requirements established from time to time by Fannie Mae. In exchange for this delegation of authority, we share risk for a portion of the losses that may result from a borrower's default. For more information regarding our risk-sharing agreements with Fannie Mae, see &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Credit Quality and Allowance for Risk-Sharing Obligations.&#8221; Most of the Fannie Mae loans that we originate are sold in the form of a Fannie Mae-guaranteed security to third-party investors. We also are contracted by Fannie Mae to service all loans that we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We are one of 23 lenders approved as a Freddie Mac Program Plus lender under which we originate and sell to Freddie Mac multifamily, manufactured housing communities, student housing, affordable, and seniors housing loans that satisfy Freddie Mac's underwriting and other eligibility requirements. Under the program, we submit our completed loan underwriting package to Freddie Mac and obtain Freddie Mac's commitment to purchase the loan at a specified price after closing. Freddie Mac ultimately performs its own underwriting of loans that we sell to it. Freddie Mac may choose to hold, sell, or later securitize such loans. We very rarely have any risk-sharing arrangements on loans we sell to Freddie Mac under Program Plus. We also are contracted by Freddie Mac to service all loans that we originate under its program. 

&#160; 

On September 4, 2012, we closed the acquisition of CWCapital LLC (&#8220;CWCapital&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of CW Financial Services LLC (&#8220;CW FS&#8221;), which was an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (&#8220;Fortress&#8221;), at which time the total consideration transferred was valued at approximately $231.1 million, consisting of $80.0 million in cash and approximately 11.6 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $151.1 million issued in a private placement to CW FS (the &#8220;CW Acquisition&#8221;). Upon closing of the CW Acquisition, CWCapital became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was renamed Walker &#38; Dunlop Capital, LLC. Additionally, Fortress became our largest shareholder. The CW Acquisition increased our servicing portfolio by $14.5 billion and significantly increased our origination capacity and national presence, particularly for our multifamily and FHA finance products. 

&#160; 

Under certain limited circumstances, we may make preferred equity investments in entities controlled by certain of our borrowers that will assist those borrowers in acquiring and repositioning properties. The terms of such investments are negotiated with each investment. As of December 31, 2015, we have made commitments to fund such preferred equity investments in monthly installments totaling $42.8 million, none of which has yet been funded. We expect to fund these commitments over the next 18 to 36 months, beginning in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

FHA Finance 

&#160; 

As an approved HUD MAP and HUD LEAN lender and Ginnie Mae issuer, we provide construction and permanent loans to developers and owners of multifamily housing, affordable housing, seniors housing, and healthcare facilities. We submit our completed loan underwriting package to HUD and obtain HUD's approval to originate the loan. 

&#160; 

HUD-insured loans are typically placed in single loan pools which back Ginnie Mae securities. Ginnie Mae is a United States government corporation in the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, and we very rarely bear any risk of loss on Ginnie Mae securities. In the event of a default on a HUD-insured loan, HUD will reimburse approximately 99% of any losses of principal and interest on the loan, and Ginnie Mae will reimburse the remaining losses. We are obligated to continue to advance principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts on Ginnie Mae securities until the Ginnie Mae security is fully paid. 

&#160; 

Capital Markets 

&#160; 

We serve as an intermediary in the placement of commercial real estate debt between institutional sources of capital, such as life insurance companies, investment banks, commercial banks, pension funds, CMBS issuers, and other institutional investors, and owners of all types of commercial real estate. A client seeking to finance or refinance a property will seek our assistance in developing different alternatives and soliciting interest from various sources of capital. We often advise on capital structure, develop the financing package, facilitate negotiations between our client and institutional sources of capital, coordinate due diligence, and assist in closing the transaction. In these instances, we do not underwrite or fund the loan and do not retain any interest in the loan. In cases where we do not fund the loan, we act as a loan broker and service some of these loans. 

&#160; 

On September 25, 2014, we executed a purchase agreement to acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Johnson Capital Group, Inc. (&#8220;Johnson Capital&#8221;). The acquisition of Johnson Capital closed on November 1, 2014 (&#8220;JC Acquisition&#8221;). The consideration transferred totaled $23.5 million and consisted of $17.6 million in cash and $5.9 million of our common stock issued in a private placement. The JC Acquisition expanded our network of loan originators, provided further diversification to our origination platform, and increased our HUD servicing portfolio. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Proprietary Capital 

&#160; 

We conduct our Proprietary Capital business using our own balance sheet. During 2015 and 2014, we also operated the CMBS Partnership (discussed in detail below) through a partnership agreement with an institutional investor. We made investments side by side with our partnership investor and served as the manager of the partnership. In our capacity as manager, we leveraged the invested capital to originate, hold, and service commercial real estate debt. The Proprietary Capital products we currently offer using our own balance sheet include: 

&#160; 

Interim Loans 

&#160; 

We offer interim loans that provide floating-rate, interest-only debt for terms of up to three years to experienced borrowers seeking to acquire or reposition multifamily properties that do not currently qualify for permanent financing (the &#8220;Interim Program&#8221;). We finance and underwrite all loans originated through the Interim Program. During the time the loans are outstanding, we assume the full risk of loss on the loans. In addition, we service and asset-manage loans originated through the Interim Program, with the ultimate goal of providing permanent financing on the properties. These loans are classified as held for investment on our balance sheet during such time that they are outstanding. We have not experienced any delinquencies or charged off any loans originated under the Interim Program. We held 13 loans originated under the Interim Program with an aggregate $233.4 million balance as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

CMBS 

&#160; 

In addition to our CMBS product offering through our Capital Markets platform, we offer CMBS executions through our own proprietary CMBS platform. At December 31, 2015, we owned a 40% interest in a partnership with an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group (the &#8220;CMBS Partnership&#8221;). The CMBS Partnership began offering financing through a CMBS platform for all commercial property types throughout the United States (the &#8220;CMBS Program&#8221;) during 2014. The property types include multifamily, hospitality, retail, office, industrial, and other commercial real estate. The CMBS Partnership expects to sell all loans originated by it into secondary securitization offerings led by large institutional investors within 120 days of origination. The loans in the CMBS Partnership are selected, funded, and underwritten by the CMBS Partnership. We perform the servicing for loans originated through the CMBS Program and receive a fee for such servicing. The CMBS Partnership assumes the full risk of loss on the loans while it holds the loans. Additionally, the CMBS Partnership may be obligated to repurchase loans it sold into a securitization if certain representations and warranties it provides in connection with such loans are breached. Neither we nor the CMBS Partnership has ever been required to repurchase a loan. 

&#160; 

During the second quarter of 2015, we increased our ownership interest in the CMBS Partnership from 20% to 40%. During 2015 and 2014, we accounted for our ownership interest under the equity method of accounting. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company increased its ownership interest in the CMBS Partnership to 100% (the &#8220;CMBS Partnership Transaction&#8221;), making the CMBS Partnership a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Consequently, the Company began to consolidate the CMBS Partnership&#8217;s balances beginning with the first quarter of 2016. Prior to the CMBS Partnership Transaction, we did not hold the loans and bore none of the direct losses that may have resulted from a borrower default after the loan was sold to a CMBS conduit. 

&#160; 

Investment Sales Brokerage Services 

&#160; 

During the second quarter of 2015, in connection with an acquisition more fully described below, we began offering investment sales brokerage services to owners and developers of multifamily properties that are seeking to sell these properties. We seek to maximize proceeds and certainty of closure for our clients through our knowledge of the commercial real estate and capital markets and our experienced transaction professionals. Our services are offered primarily in the eastern United States, with a particular focus in the Southeast. We added an investment sales brokerage team based in the Mid-Atlantic during the fourth quarter of 2015. We will seek to add other investment sales brokerage talent with the goal of expanding these brokerage services nationally. 

&#160; 

On April 21, 2015, we completed our purchase of 75% of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of Engler Financial Group, LLC (&#8220;EFG&#8221;) for an agreed-upon price of $13.0 million payable in $11.1 million cash and $1.9 

&#160;

million of our common stock issued in a private placement (the &#8220;EFG Acquisition&#8221;). The net assets purchased from EFG were contributed to a newly formed subsidiary, Walker &#38; Dunlop Investment Sales, LLC (&#8220;WDIS&#8221;), through which we conduct our investment sales operations. Prior to the acquisition, EFG was an investment advisory and investment sales brokerage firm serving the multifamily market. Its primary activity was brokering investment sales of multifamily properties with a focus in the southeastern United States. The acquisition allowed us to enter the multifamily investment sales market. 

&#160; 

We consolidate the activities of WDIS and present the portion of WDIS that we do not control as Noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Net income from noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

&#160; 

Direct Loan Originators and Correspondent Network 

&#160; 

We originate loans directly through loan originators operating out of 25 offices nationwide. At December 31, 2015, we employed 104 loan originators and investment sales brokers. These individuals have deep knowledge of the commercial real estate lending business and bring with them extensive relationships with some of the largest property owners in the country. They have a thorough understanding of the financial needs and objectives of borrowers, the geographic markets in which they operate, market conditions specific to different types of commercial properties and how to structure a loan product to meet their borrowers&#8217; needs. These loan originators collect and analyze financial and property information, assist the borrower in submitting information required to complete a loan application and, ultimately, help the borrower close the loan. Our loan originators are paid a salary and commissions based on the fees associated with the loans that they originate. 

&#160; 

In addition to our group of loan originators, at December 31, 2015, we had correspondent agreements with 22 independently owned mortgage banking companies across the country with which we have relationships for GSE and HUD loan originations. This network of correspondents helps us extend our geographic reach into new and/or smaller markets on a cost effective basis. In addition to identifying potential borrowers and key principal(s) (the individual or individuals directing the activities of the borrowing entity), our correspondents assist us in evaluating loans, including pre-screening the borrowers, key principal(s) and properties for program eligibility, coordinating due diligence, and generally providing market intelligence. In exchange for providing these services, the correspondent earns an origination fee based on a percentage of the principal amount of the financing arranged and in some cases a fee paid out over time based on the servicing revenues earned over the life of the loan. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Risk Management 

&#160; 

We use several tools to manage our Fannie Mae risk-sharing exposure. These tools include an underwriting and approval process, evaluating, and modifying our underwriting criteria given the underlying multifamily housing market fundamentals, limiting our geographic, borrower and key principal exposures, and using modified risk-sharing under the Fannie Mae DUS program. Similar tools are used to manage our exposure to credit loss on loans originated under the Interim Program and through the CMBS Program. 

&#160; 

Our underwriting process begins with a review of suitability for our investors and a detailed review of the borrower, key principal(s), and the property. We review a borrower's financial statements for minimum net worth and liquidity requirements, as well as credit and criminal background checks. We also review a borrower's and key principal(s)&#8217;s operating track record, including evaluating the performance of other properties owned by the applicable borrower and key principal(s). We also consider the borrower's and key principal(s)&#8217;s bankruptcy and foreclosure history. We believe that lending to a borrower and key principal(s) with a proven track record as an operator mitigates our credit risk. 

&#160; 

We review the fundamental value and credit profile of the underlying property, including an analysis of regional economic trends, appraisals of the property, and reviews of historical and prospective financials. Third-party vendors are engaged for appraisals, engineering reports, environmental reports, flood certification reports, zoning reports, and credit reports. We utilize a list of approved third-party vendors for these reports. Each report is reviewed by our underwriting team for accuracy, quality, and comprehensiveness. All third-party vendors are reviewed periodically for the quality of their work and are removed from our list of approved vendors if the quality or timeliness of the reports is below our 

&#160;

standards. This is particularly true for engineering and environmental reports on which we rely to make decisions regarding ongoing replacement reserves and environmental matters. 

&#160; 

In addition, we maintain concentration limits with respect to our Fannie Mae loans. We limit geographic concentration, focusing on regional employment concentration and trends. We also limit the aggregate amount of loans subject to full risk-sharing for any one borrower. We minimize individual loan concentrations under our current credit management policy to cap the loan balance subject to full risk-sharing at $60.0 million. Accordingly, we currently elect to use modified risk-sharing for loans of more than $60.0 million in order to limit our maximum loss on any one loan to $12.0 million (such exposure would occur in the event that the underlying collateral is determined to be completely without value at the time of loss). However, we occasionally elect to originate a loan with full risk sharing even when the loan balance is greater than $60.0 million if we believe the loan characteristics support such an approach. 

&#160; 

Servicing and Asset Management 

&#160; 

We service nearly all loans we originate for the GSEs, HUD, and our proprietary capital products and some of the loans we broker for institutional investors, primarily life insurance companies. We are an approved servicer for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD loans. We are a rated primary servicer with Fitch Ratings. Our servicing function includes loan servicing and asset management activities, performing or overseeing the following activities: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

carrying out all cashiering functions relating to the loan, including providing monthly billing statements to the borrower and collecting and applying payments on the loan; 

&#183; 

administering reserve and escrow funds for repairs, tenant improvements, taxes and insurance; 

&#183; 

obtaining and analyzing financial statements of the borrower and performing periodic property inspections; 

&#183; 

preparing and providing periodic reports and remittances to the GSEs, investors, master servicers, or other designated persons; 

&#183; 

administering lien filings; and 

&#183; 

performing other tasks and obligations that are delegated to us. 

&#160; 

Life insurance companies and CMBS conduits (including the CMBS Program), whose loans we may service, may perform some or all of the activities identified in the list above. We outsource some of our servicing activities to a subservicer. 

&#160; 

For most loans we service under the Fannie Mae DUS program, we are currently required to advance the principal and interest payments and tax and insurance escrow amounts for four months. We are reimbursed by Fannie Mae for these advances, which may be used to offset any losses incurred under our risk-sharing obligations once the loan is settled. 

&#160; 

Under the HUD program, we are obligated to advance tax and insurance escrow amounts and principal and interest payments on the Ginnie Mae securities until the Ginnie Mae security is fully paid. In the event of a default on a HUD-insured loan, we can elect to assign the loan to HUD and file a mortgage insurance claim. HUD will reimburse approximately 99% of any losses of principal and interest on the loan and Ginnie Mae will reimburse substantially all of the remaining losses. 

&#160; 

Walker &#38; Dunlop, LLC is assigned a contract with Ginnie Mae, which Walker &#38; Dunlop, LLC acts as a master sub-servicer of pools of loans transferred to it by Ginnie Mae for a fixed per-pool fee. As a master sub-servicer, Walker &#38; Dunlop, LLC performs the complete range of services expected of a Ginnie Mae issuer, including default services; the servicing of current, delinquent, and defaulted loans; foreclosure services; preparation and submission of claims for FHA insurance benefits and reports to Ginnie Mae; construction loan certificates conversion services; and management oversight of projects during the term of the contract. The initial term of the contract was December 16, 2011 to December 15, 2012. The contract provides Ginnie Mae the option to extend the contract for successive one-year terms beginning on December 16 in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Ginnie Mae exercised the option to extend the contract for the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, 2014-2015, and 2015-2016 terms. Ginnie Mae has not transferred any loans to Walker &#38; Dunlop, LLC under the contract, and we do not know if and when it might do so. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe we are positioned to continue growing and diversifying our business by taking advantage of opportunities in the real estate finance market. 

&#160; 

We seek to profitably grow and diversify our business by focusing on the following areas: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Remain a Top Five Lender in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Executions. We intend to further grow our GSE and HUD originations with the goal of maintaining our status as a top five lender of GSE products and becoming a top five lender of HUD products. For 2015, we ranked as the second largest Fannie Mae DUS lender, and we ranked as the fourth largest Freddie Mac Program Plus seller. Additionally, we are a top loan originator for HUD. At December 31, 2015, our origination platform had approximately 45 loan originators focused on selling GSE and HUD products, supplemented by 22 independently owned mortgage banking companies with whom we have correspondent relationships . We believe that we will have significant opportunities to continue broadening our GSE and HUD origination networks in order to maintain or grow our current market position. This expansion may include organic growth, recruitment of talented origination professionals, and potentially acquisitions of competitors with strong origination capabilities. 

&#183; 

Continue to Expand our Capital Markets Business. At December 31, 2015, we had 49 loan originators in 16 offices focused on capital markets transactions across the United States. We added 30 new loan originators to our Capital Markets team in November of 2014 with the acquisition of Johnson Capital, and we intend to continue to grow our Capital Markets team to strengthen our market position and borrower relationships to meet the expected increase in demand for commercial real estate debt origination and refinance activity in the coming years. We intend to continue to grow our national presence, to include additional offices focused on capital markets products and originations. Continued growth of our Capital Markets group will provide greater exposure to the overall commercial real estate market, expose us to new correspondent relationships, and provide us with institutional access to deal flow supporting our Proprietary Capital solutions. 

&#183; 

Continue to Develop Proprietary Sources of Capital and Expand Our Product Offerings. Since our initial public offering, we have expanded our product offerings to include bridge financing for transitional properties, a proprietary CMBS platform, and multifamily investment sales. We anticipate offering additional commercial real estate loan products and services to our clients as their financial needs evolve. We believe that we have the structuring, underwriting, servicing, credit, and asset management expertise to offer additional commercial real estate loan products; and we believe that cash on hand, together with third-party financing sources, will allow us to meet client demand for additional products that are within our areas of expertise, including multifamily and other lending for our balance sheet or for our partnerships. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are one of 25 approved lenders that participate in Fannie Mae&#8217;s DUS program and one of 23 lenders approved as a Freddie Mac Program Plus lender. We face significant competition across our business, including, but not limited to, commercial banks, commercial real estate service providers, CMBS conduits, and insurance companies, some of which are also investors in loans we originate. Many of these competitors enjoy advantages over us, including greater name recognition, financial resources, and access to lower-cost capital. Commercial banks may have an advantage over us in originating commercial loans if borrowers already have other lending relationships with the bank. 

&#160; 

We compete on the basis of quality of service, relationships, loan structure, terms, pricing, and industry depth. Industry depth includes the knowledge of local and national real estate market conditions, commercial real estate, loan product expertise, and the ability to analyze and manage credit risk. Our competitors seek to compete aggressively on the basis of these factors and our success depends on our ability to offer attractive loan products, provide superior service, demonstrate industry depth, maintain and capitalize on relationships with investors, borrowers and key loan correspondents, and remain competitive in pricing. In addition, future changes in laws, regulations, GSE and HUD program requirements, and consolidation in the commercial real estate finance market could lead to the entry of more competitors. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions. The level of regulation and supervision that we are subject to varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activities involved. The regulatory requirements that apply to our activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more restrictive, making our compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restricting our ability to conduct our business in the manner that it is now conducted. Changes in applicable regulatory requirements, including changes in their enforcement, could materially and adversely affect us. 

&#160; 

Federal and State Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities 

&#160; 

Our multifamily and commercial real estate lending, servicing and asset management businesses are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States. In addition, these businesses may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things, regulate lending activities, regulate conduct with borrowers, establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges and require disclosures to borrowers. Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates, as well as other charges on certain collection practices and creditor remedies. Some states also require licensing of lenders, loan brokers, and loan servicers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We also are required to comply with certain provisions of, among other statutes and regulations, the USA PATRIOT Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, which we refer to as &#8220;ERISA,&#8221; and federal and state securities laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Requirements of the GSEs and HUD (Collectively the &#8220;Agencies&#8221;) 

&#160; 

To maintain our status as an approved lender for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and as a HUD-approved mortgagee and issuer of Ginnie Mae securities, we are required to meet and maintain various eligibility criteria from time to time established by the Agencies, such as minimum net worth, operational liquidity and collateral requirements, and compliance with reporting requirements. We also are required to originate our loans and perform our loan servicing functions in accordance with the applicable program requirements and guidelines from time to time established by the Agencies. If we fail to comply with the requirements of any of these programs, the Agencies may terminate or withdraw our approval. In addition, the Agencies have the authority under their guidelines to terminate a lender's authority to sell loans to it and service their loans. The loss of one or more of these approvals would have a material adverse impact on us and could result in further disqualification with other counterparties, and we may be required to obtain additional state lender or mortgage banker licensing to originate loans if that status is revoked. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we employed 504 full-time employees. All employees, except our executive officers, are employed by our operating subsidiary, Walker &#38; Dunlop, LLC. Our executive officers are employees of Walker &#38; Dunlop, Inc. None of our employees is represented by a union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are good. 

&#160;
