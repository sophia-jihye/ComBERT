 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

American Public Education, Inc., or APEI, provides online and on-campus postsecondary education to over 97,500 &#32;students through two subsidiary institutions. In this Annual Report, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;the Company&#8221; and similar terms refer to APEI and its subsidiary institutions collectively unless the context indicates otherwise. 

This Item 1 of our Annual Report contains a Company Overview section that provides information regarding our subsidiary institutions, an explanation of our reporting segments, an overview of the postsecondary educational market and market opportunities, our competitive strengths, growth strategy, executive officers, the seasonality of our operations, and where investors can obtain available information. Item 1 also contains a section entitled &#8220;Our Institutions&#8221; that provides institution specific information regarding each of our two subsidiary institutions, and a section entitled &#8220;Regulatory Environment,&#8221; which contains information on some of the regulations that impact postsecondary educational institutions. 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

Subsidiary Institutions 

Our institutions offer programs designed to prepare individuals for productive contributions to their professions and society, and to offer opportunities that may advance students in their current profession or help them prepare for their next career. Our wholly-owned operating subsidiary institutions include the following: 

&#8226; 

American Public University System, Inc., or APUS, provides online postsecondary education directed primarily at the needs of the military and public safety communities. APUS is an online university that includes American Military University, or AMU, and American Public University, or APU. APUS is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. APUS has approximately 96,000 &#32;students and offers 100 &#32;degree programs and 95 &#32;certificate programs in fields of study related to national security, military studies, intelligence, homeland security, criminal justice, technology, business administration, education, health science, and liberal arts. APUS employs approximately 410 &#32;full-time faculty members and 1,800 &#32;part-time faculty members. 

Since APUS's founding in 1991 as AMU, a distance learning graduate-level institution for military officers seeking an advanced degree in military studies, APUS has gradually broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, public safety, and certain other civilian professional communities. In 2002, AMU was reorganized into a single university system, APUS, with two components: AMU, which is focused on educating military students, and APU, which is focused on educating non-military students. As an online institution of higher learning, we believe APUS is well-suited to meet the needs of its military students who serve in positions requiring extended and irregular work schedules, are on-call for rapid response missions, participate in extended deployments and exercises, travel or relocate frequently or have limited financial resources. Although APUS's focus has broadened, APUS continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with the military community. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 56% &#32;of APUS&#8217;s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment. The remainder of APUS&#8217;s students were military-affiliated individuals (such as veterans, reservists or National Guard members), public safety professionals (such as law-enforcement personnel or other first responders) and other civilians (such as working adult students). 

&#8226; 

National Education Seminars, Inc., which we refer to as Hondros College of Nursing, or HCON, provides nursing education to students at four campuses in the State of Ohio, as well as online, to serve the needs of the nursing and healthcare communities. HCON&#8217;s programs are offered in a quarterly format to approximately 1,520 &#32;students. 

HCON offers a Diploma in Practical Nursing and an Associate Degree in Nursing at its Ohio campuses, which are located in the suburban areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton. HCON also offers an online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing completion program, which we refer to as the RN-to-BSN Program, predominantly to students in Ohio. HCON is nationally accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools and the RN-to-BSN Program is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, or CCNE. HCON&#8217;s locations and programs are approved by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools and the RN-to-BSN Program is approved by the Ohio Department of Higher Education. In addition, the Diploma in Practical Nursing and Associate Degree in Nursing programs are approved by the Ohio Board of Nursing. HCON employs approximately 100 &#32;full-time faculty members and 45 &#32;part-time faculty members. 

We acquired HCON on November 1, 2013. Our acquisition of HCON is consistent with our strategy to diversify our education business and expand further into health science and technology focused programs. We believe HCON will potentially serve as a platform for future healthcare related program expansion. 

Our Reporting Segments 

Our operations are organized into two reporting segments: 

&#8226; 

American Public Education Segment, or APEI Segment. &#32; This segment reflects the operational activities of APUS, other corporate activities, and minority investments. 

&#8226; 

Hondros College of Nursing Segment, or HCON Segment. This segment reflects the operational activities of HCON. We acquired HCON on November 1, 2013, and therefore the consolidated results for periods prior to November 1, 2013 do not include any results from HCON. 

Our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;decreased to $327.9 million &#32;from $350.0 million &#32;in the year ended December 31, 2014 . Net income was $32.4 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to net income of $40.9 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Financial information regarding each of our reporting segments, including information regarding segment revenue, net income, and total assets for each of the last three fiscal years, can be found in our Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report; financial information is reported in this Annual Report in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; &#8220;Selected Financial Data,&#8221; and &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Postsecondary Education Market Structure and Market Opportunities 

Today, the U.S. postsecondary education market comprises more than 4,000 colleges and universities serving both traditional college-aged students and adult learners. The market is highly fragmented with institutions varying by geography, program offerings, delivery method, ownership, affordability, level of academic quality and selectivity of admissions. No single institution holds a significant proportion of the overall postsecondary education market. 

We believe that many students are seeking an educational value that offers them the programs they want, at a competitive price, in an engaging and often mobile format that will support their immediate and long-term career aspirations, and that employers are seeking to hire graduates with competencies aligned to their needs. Thus, institutions such as APUS, with affordable pricing, flexible delivery, and a robust catalog of offerings aligned to workforce needs are well-positioned to address the current challenges and to meet the demands of a connected and mobile society. 

We believe that with nearly 2.2 million active-duty military and reservists, the U.S. Armed Forces will continue to be a significant market for online education even with planned troop drawdowns. Because of their irregular schedules, geographic mobility and access to tuition assistance funding, we believe service members will continue to seek respected universities that provide military-focused support services coupled with online curriculum that is designed to prepare graduates for career advancement. As part of their longstanding tradition, military leaders often encourage service members to capitalize on their earned education benefits, and to enhance their qualifications for purposes of the military&#8217;s compensation, promotion, assignment, and performance systems. 

At the same time, elected and private-industry leaders are heavily promoting new policies and campaigns to facilitate the hiring of veterans, with a priority on placing individuals who are transitioning from military service to the private sector. As these policies lower barriers to nonmilitary jobs and federal contracts for veteran-owned businesses, postsecondary distance universities offer valuable educational opportunities for military constituents regardless of where they live, work and learn. 

The Department of Defense (DoD) uniform tuition assistance policy offers service members a variety of affordable education and financial aid options. Additionally, veterans (and certain service members) are entitled to educational benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). For more information, refer to &#8220;Our Institutions&#8221; and &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.&#8221; 

We believe that, like the U.S. military community, our nation&#8217;s public service professionals need access to affordable and flexible education that fits their changing schedules. More and more, we believe leadership advancement within many public service agencies requires an advanced degree. Often public service professionals have extended and shifting schedules preventing them from attending traditional or in-class programs. Many traditional institutions lack the broad selection of degrees, certifications, and concentrations that are specifically relevant to public service careers. APUS addresses this void by offering a broad array of industry-specific programs that are continually assessed against learning outcomes, and enhanced through guidance and input from selected industry leaders. 

On a national level the expanding healthcare sector is driving demand for nursing education. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&#8217; Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2016-17 Edition, job opportunities for registered nurses are expected to grow approximately 16% between 2014 and 2024, faster than the average growth for all occupations. Despite anticipated growth in job opportunities, a 2014 report from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing stated that over 53,000 qualified applications were not accepted by entry-level baccalaureate programs at nursing schools in 2013. These statistics suggest there may be unmet demand from qualified students for on-campus and online nursing educational programs. These statistics may not be indicative of demand on a regional or local level, including in Ohio. 

Our institutions continue to face significant competition and other challenges, including challenges related to federal policies governing education providers and financial aid. Most public institutions are aided by substantial government subsidies. Public and private nonprofit institutions benefit from government and foundation grants, in addition to tax-exempt status, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources not widely available to for-profit institutions. Many public competitors benefit from longstanding name recognition, and they are able to directly recruit students more cost-effectively, especially in their local markets. In addition, competitors are upgrading the way they deliver their academic programs, which involves a variety of traditional, blended, and asynchronous learning platforms. Additionally, non-traditional competitors, such as entities offering coding bootcamps, are offering new alternative educational paths. Some institutions are shifting their delivery models to include a mix of traditional, nontraditional, credit-bearing and non-credit-bearing education programs, and massively open online courses (MOOCs) can be offered at little to no cost. This trend is accelerating as many institutions realign and adopt the flexible and cost-effective benefits that online education offers the modern learner. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe our institutions demonstrate the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

Academic Excellence. &#32;We are committed to continually assessing and enhancing our academic programs and our student services to support successful outcomes for our students and graduates. APUS invests significant resources in faculty, learning technologies, curriculum design, and student support for its learning community. APUS&#8217;s academic program offerings are overseen by an independent Board of Trustees that includes former college presidents and executive team members, active accreditation evaluators, a former Commandant of the Marine Corps, a former Navy Admiral, and a former Department of the Army Inspector General. &#32; Additionally, APUS utilizes Industry Advisory Councils (IACs) to evaluate and inform the overall and program-specific academic learning strategy. This facilitates efforts to connect APUS&#8217;s curriculum to the industry and the students it serves. Similarly, HCON focuses on educational support by hiring experienced industry professionals while enhancing student services to assist students with courses, labs, and clinical offerings. HCON&#8217;s faculty includes individuals with research experience, and specialized nursing credentials. 

&#8226; 

Affordable Tuition. &#32;The combined tuition and fees at APUS are less expensive for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in-state cost at a public university. This, when combined with APUS&#8217;s undergraduate book grant, which is provided to all undergraduate students, results in significant savings for students. Following a tuition increase that was effective in July 2015, undergraduate tuition at APUS is $270 per semester hour, or $810 per three-credit course. A full 121-credit hour undergraduate degree may be earned for $32,670 in tuition costs at current tuition rates. Following the July 2015 tuition increase, APUS&#8217;s graduate tuition is $350 per semester hour, or $1,050 per three-credit course, which means many APUS graduate degrees may be earned for $12,600 in tuition at current tuition rates. APUS provides a tuition grant to support students who are U.S. Military active-duty service members, Guard, Reserve, military spouses and dependents, and veterans. For such individuals tuition is set at pre-July 2015 rates, with undergraduate course tuition at $250 per semester hour, and graduate course tuition at $325 per semester hour. APUS estimates that the tuition grant applies to approximately 75% of its total net course registrations.Tuition and fees at HCON are also designed to be affordable and competitive with those of similar institutions offering the same level of flexibility, accessibility, and student experience. After taking into account the tuition grant that is available to service members, APUS&#8217;s undergraduate tuition is covered 100% by DoD tuition assistance and graduate tuition is approximately 80% covered. Tuition, fees, and books at HCON are also designed to be affordable and competitive with those of similar institutions offering the same level of flexibility, accessibility, and student experience. 

&#8226; 

Online Higher Education and Diverse Program Offerings. &#32;APUS designs courses and programs specifically for online delivery. APUS recruits and prepares its faculty exclusively to deliver online instruction. Because students are located worldwide, APUS focuses on providing asynchronous, interactive education to students that fits their busy lives. APUS offers 100 &#32;degree programs in fields ranging from homeland security, space studies, and emergency and disaster management, to liberal arts and electrical engineering. HCON currently offers a Diploma in Practical Nursing, an Associate Degree in Nursing, and an online registered nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing completion program. 

Our Strategic Approach 

To grow our revenue and improve our financial performance, we plan to employ the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Maintain Our Leading Position in the Military Market. &#32;APUS has focused on the needs of the U.S. military community since being founded as AMU. The combination of our online model, focused curriculum, and outreach to military communities has enabled APUS to maintain market share against more established schools, many of which are traditional schools offering on-campus instruction that have served the military market for longer periods. APUS remains firmly committed to providing exceptional service and support to the military community. One example of this commitment and the resources dedicated to it is APUS&#8217;s Virtual Veterans Center, which is an online information repository, a gateway to personalized support services, and a gathering place for veteran and active-duty students and alumni. It provides users with branch-specific discussion boards, career services, academic advising, Student Veterans of America chapter information, and a range of other resources. 

&#8226; 

Broaden APUS&#8217;s Acceptance in the Civilian Market. &#32;APUS designs its curriculum to be relevant to public safety professionals and civilian professionals with extended and irregular work schedules, and other adult learners. We believe that today&#8217;s adult students, regardless of their specific career requirements, are looking for a highly-tailored educational experience that prepares them for success. While APUS&#8217;s quality, affordable, and diverse academic offerings are highly attractive options for students. 

&#8226; 

Add New Degree Programs and Offerings at Our Institutions. Over the long term, we intend for our institutions to continue expanding their degree offerings to meet student needs and marketplace demands, with a focus on new programs in fields exhibiting higher than average growth. Our acquisition of HCON, and the type of program offerings at HCON, reflect this strategy, and we plan to focus on increasing student enrollments in HCON&#8217;s programs, grow HCON&#8217;s on-campus and online program offerings, and open new campuses for HCON. APUS is also preparing, academically and culturally, to potentially begin offering doctoral programs in the next few years. 

&#8226; 

Pursue and Expand Strategic Partnerships. We believe that articulation agreements and partnerships with other institutions of higher learning, corporations, professional associations, and other organizations are important to institutional performance, enrollment growth and expanding access to higher education. We plan for our institutions to continue pursuing such relationships. 

&#8226; 

Utilize Innovative Education Technology. APUS has developed proprietary technologies and systems to enhance student services, classroom instruction, learning outcomes, and the overall student experience. To further improve student outcomes, satisfaction rates, access, our institutional efficiency and our brand differentiation, we are focused on providing a unique and advanced learning environment, including through enhancing our existing technologies and investing in emerging technologies and companies. For example, as a result of our investment in Fidelis Education, Inc., or Fidelis Education, we pursued a pilot program to provide students with access to Fidelis Education&#8217;s ClearPath system. The ClearPath system is designed to help online students interact with faculty and staff in meaningful ways outside the classroom, improve persistence, and help students successfully prepare for career transitions. After a successful pilot, in 2015 we opened the ClearPath system to all APUS students. 

&#8226; 

Improve Student Persistence. &#32;Our ability to maintain and increase enrollment depends largely on our ability to attract new students and provide them with an effective university experience. We are focused on increasing the percentage of our students who are prepared for the rigors of higher education and capable of successfully completing courses and graduating from our programs. We have launched several projects at APUS to accomplish these goals, including initiatives to attract college-ready students, increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom, and introduce new classroom interventions to help students succeed academically. In addition, we research and explore new ways to improve student persistence and academic quality through collaborative initiatives with non-profit organizations and other universities. 

To assist us in achieving elements of our growth strategy and further develop our business capabilities, we will continue to assess and pursue strategic investments and acquisitions. Future strategic investments or acquisitions could include, among other things, investments in partnerships or joint ventures with, or the acquisition of, other schools, service providers, or education technology-related companies. Examples of our investments and acquisitions include: 

&#8226; 

Hondros College of Nursing. &#32;In November 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of National Education Seminars, Inc., which we refer to as HCON, for an approximate adjusted aggregate purchase price of $46.8 million. As described more fully elsewhere in this Annual Report, HCON offers a Diploma in Practical Nursing, an Associate Degree in Nursing, and an online RN-to-BSN program. 

&#8226; 

New Horizons Worldwide, Inc. &#32;In September 2012, we made a $6.8 million equity investment and a $6.0 million debt investment in a holding company that acquired New Horizons, a global information technology training company operating over 300 locations around the world through franchise arrangements in approximately 70 countries. In connection with the investment we acquired approximately 19.9% of the fully diluted equity of New Horizons and are entitled to certain rights, including rights to representation on the Board of Directors of the holding company. In December 2014, New Horizons prepaid the $6.0 million debt investment we made in connection with the transaction. 

&#8226; 

Fidelis Education, Inc. In February 2013, we made a $4.0 million investment in preferred stock of Fidelis Education, representing approximately 21.6% of its fully diluted equity. On February 1, 2016, the Company made an additional $950,000 &#32;investment in preferred stock of Fidelis Education, increasing its investment in Fidelis Education to approximately 22% &#32;of its fully diluted equity. Fidelis Education offers a learning relationship management platform that has the goal of improving education advising and career mentoring services offered to students as they pursue college degrees. In connection with its investments, APEI is entitled to certain rights, including the right to representation on Fidelis Education&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

For additional information regarding these and our other investments and acquisitions, please refer to the &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221;

Seasonality 

Our quarterly results fluctuate and, therefore, the results in any quarter may not represent the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year. Our revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our enrollments. Our student population varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, student attrition, the success of our marketing programs, and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these factors.

&#160; 

American Public University System 

APUS is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, and is based in Charles Town, West Virginia. In 2002, APUS was organized into a single university system, with two component universities, AMU, which is focused on appealing to military students, and APU, which is focused on appealing to non-military students. APUS traces its roots to AMU, which was founded as a distance learning graduate-level institution for military officers seeking an advanced degree in military studies. APUS has gradually broadened its focus to include other military communities, veterans, public safety, and certain other non-military communities. APUS is an online institution of higher learning, which we believe is well-suited to its students, especially its military students, who serve in positions requiring extended and irregular work schedules, are on-call for rapid response missions, participate in extended deployments and exercises, travel or relocate frequently and have limited financial resources. 

Although APUS&#8217;s focus has broadened, it continues to have an emphasis on its relationship with the military community. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 56% &#32;of APUS&#8217;s students self-reported that they served in the military on active duty at the time of initial enrollment. The remainder of APUS&#8217;s students are military-affiliated professionals (such as veterans, reservists or National Guard members), public safety professionals (such as law-enforcement personnel or other first responders) and other civilians (such as working adult students). 

Curriculum and Scheduling 

APUS offers 195 &#32;degree and certificate programs through over 1,600 unique courses that are offered in either eight- or sixteen-week formats. Academic terms begin on the first Monday of each month. APUS&#8217;s programs are as follows:

APUS&#8217;s certificate programs generally consist of a minimum of 18 semester hours and focus on a particular component of a broader degree program. Students may earn discrete certificates or earn certificates in combination with work toward a degree program. APUS also offers several Learning Tracks comprised of one two-week &#8220;Classroom Success&#8221; orientation course about online learning, and three academic courses in a related area of interest. A Learning Track allows students to pursue a course of study without having to commit to a degree or certificate program. 

Enrollment and Student Body 

The active student body of APUS consists of approximately 96,000 &#32;students, most of whom hold full-time employment. Active students are defined as those who have completed a course in the past 12 months, or are currently enrolled or registered for an upcoming course. APUS disenrolls students who fail to register for and complete at least one course in a calendar year, although students may apply for re-admission and active status. &#32; Students on extended military deployments may apply for a program hold, which keeps such students active until they return and are able to resume their studies. 

Accreditation 

APUS is regionally accredited by HLC, which accredits degree-granting institutions located in a 19-state region, including West Virginia, and is recognized by ED. The status and meaning of this institutional accreditation is described more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.&#8221; 

&#160; 

In addition to institutional accreditation by HLC, certain programs offered by APUS have received specialized accreditations or professional recognition. For example, the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs, or ACBSP, accredits the following programs: 

&#8226; Associate of Science, Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Accounting; 

&#8226; Associate of Arts, Bachelor and Master of Business Administration; 

&#8226; Associate of Arts and Bachelor of Arts in Hospitality Management; 

&#8226; Associate of Arts, Bachelor of Arts, and Master of Arts in Management; 

&#8226; Associate of Arts in Real Estate Studies; 

&#8226; Associate of Arts and Bachelor of Arts in Retail Management; 

&#8226; Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in Reverse Logistics Management; 

&#8226; Bachelor of Arts in Marketing; and 

&#8226; Bachelor and Master of Arts in Transportation and Logistics Management. 

CCNE accredits the Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Furthermore, APUS has obtained professional recognition for its program concentrations in Human Resources from the Society for Human Resource Management, certain courses in the Sports and Health Sciences program from the American Sport Education Program for Bronze Level Certification and the National Academy of Sports Medicine Performance Enhancement Specialist, for the Information Systems Security program from the National Security Agency - Information Assurance Courseware Evaluation, and certain courses in the Human Development and Family Studies program from the National Council on Family Relations for the Certified Family Life Educator. These accreditations and recognitions are described more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.&#8221; 

Student Recruitment and Marketing 

&#160; 

APUS&#8217;s marketing strategy traditionally focused on building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with organizations and individuals in military and public safety communities. The core of APUS&#8217;s referral strategy is rooted in our military and public safety outreach teams, which serve those primary communities and develop lasting partnerships. We believe APUS&#8217;s reputation as a trusted educator yields peer-to-peer referrals, and positions APUS as a respected institution among top federal and private sector employers. These relationships, as well as APUS&#8217;s student and alumni networks, also create personal referrals. This relationship-based marketing approach enables APUS to achieve student acquisition costs lower than we believe it would otherwise have if it focused more heavily on traditional media advertising. 

APUS supplements relationship-based marketing with traditional media advertising and multifaceted interactive marketing campaigns to create greater brand awareness, particularly for the APU brand outside the military and public safety communities, and to increase inquiries from potential students. In these campaigns, APUS utilizes digital marketing channels such as organic search, pay-per-click, banner advertising, and online social media, among others. This aspect of APUS&#8217;s marketing strategy, along with increased competition and more investment in marketing the less well known APU brand, has resulted in increased student acquisition costs, and has also attracted students who generally did not perform as well as those who enrolled through relationship-based marketing. In the fourth quarter of 2014, APUS revised this strategy to use a more targeted and narrower geographical approach that was intended to attract students with greater college readiness. 

Student Admissions 

APUS welcomes prospective students to apply for admission at any time through an online application process. The current qualifications for most undergraduate programs are a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. Applicants for graduate programs must hold a bachelor&#8217;s degree from an accredited U.S. institution or an equivalent foreign institution. Certain programs may have additional admissions standards and restrictions. Following admission students are issued a student ID number and password, and are provided information on how to finalize their admission and apply for evaluation of transfer credits. Students are also provided information on how to register for courses, arrange for payment, and navigate the online student environment. 

In April 2015, APUS implemented an admissions process requiring prospective students to complete a free, non-credit admissions assessment if they are not (i) active duty military or veteran applicants; (ii) graduates of certified federal, state or local law enforcement or public safety academies; or (iii) students with at least nine hours of transfer credit from an accredited institution with a grade of &#8220;C&#8221; or better for each course. 

APUS continues to improve the learning experience and attract students who are more likely to persist in its programs, and may implement a number of important changes and initiatives to admit more college ready students. Such initiatives may include altering admissions standards, which may have an adverse effect on APUS&#8217;s enrollment and our financial condition. 

For additional information on the risks associated with such initiatives and the APUS admissions process please refer to &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.&#8221; 

Cost of Attendance and Financial Aid 

We believe that APUS&#8217;s ability to offer affordable programs is one of its competitive strengths. Many APUS students also transfer a significant number of previously earned academic credit hours, which reduces the cost and time of earning their degrees. 

Beginning in July 2015, APUS increased undergraduate and graduate tuition by approximately 8%. Undergraduate tuition at APUS is now $270 per semester hour, or $810 per three-credit course. A full 121-credit hour undergraduate degree may be earned for $32,670 in tuition costs at current tuition rates. APUS&#8217;s graduate tuition is now $350 per semester hour, or $1,050 per three-credit course, which means many APUS graduate degrees may be earned for $12,600 in tuition at current tuition rates. The combined tuition, fees and books at APUS are designed to be less expensive for undergraduate and graduate students than the average in-state cost at a public university. APUS provides a tuition grant to support students who are U.S. Military active-duty service members, Guard, Reserve, military spouses and dependents, and veterans. For such individuals tuition is set at pre-July 2015 rates, with undergraduate course tuition at $250 per semester hour, and graduate course tuition at $325 per semester hour. APUS estimates that the tuition grant applies to approximately 75% of its total net course registrations. 

The July 2015 tuition increase was APUS's first undergraduate tuition increase since 2000, and the first graduate tuition increase in four years. Based on information in the College Board's 2015 Trends in College Pricing (undergraduate) and the National Center for Education Statistics Digest of Educational Statistics 2013-14 (graduate), we estimate that, after the tuition increase, APUS's combined tuition, fees, and books remain approximately 19% less for undergraduate students and 38% less for graduate students than the average published in-state rates at public universities. 

Undergraduate students enrolled in courses for academic credit receive their textbooks and certain course materials at no additional cost to them through a book grant program. This book grant represents an average potential savings over the course of a student&#8217;s undergraduate degree program of approximately $5,192 as compared to public four-year colleges and universities according to comparative information from The College Board&#8217;s Trends in College Pricing 2015 &#32;report. &#32; APUS also utilizes open access and online library materials where applicable and works with various publishers to reduce the cost of textbooks and course materials. 

APUS does not charge an admission fee or fees for services such as registration, course drops, and similar events that trigger fees at many other institutions. Because APUS is an exclusively online institution, there are no required resident fees, such as for parking, food service, student union, and recreation. APUS charges students a technology fee, but provides a grant to cover the technology fee for students using DoD tuition assistance programs. When applicable, APUS students are charged certain additional fees, such as graduation, late registration, transcript request, and comprehensive examination fees. 

DoD tuition assistance programs cover $750 of the tuition costs per course for military students, and these students may also be able to use VA education benefits or aid from ED&#8217;s Title IV programs to cover any remaining cost, as described more fully below in &#8220;Sources of Student Financing&#8221; &#32; and &#32; &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.&#8221; APUS has set its tuition grant so that the DoD tuition assistance program covers the full tuition cost of undergraduate courses for members of the military up to the annual maximum benefit. 

Sources of Student Financing 

APUS&#8217;s students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, DoD tuition assistance programs, VA education benefits, ED&#8217;s Title IV programs, private loans, state and federal grants, and corporate reimbursement programs. Most of APUS&#8217;s students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. Students utilizing ED&#8217;s Title IV programs accounted for 32% &#32;of APUS&#8217;s net course registrations in 2015 , and we believe that the ability of our students to participate in these programs is essential to APUS&#8217;s success. Participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs, VA education benefits and ED&#8217;s Title IV programs add to APUS&#8217;s regulatory burden, as described more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements.&#8221; Participation in these programs means that changes to or interruptions in federal appropriations for these programs or other actions by the federal government will impact APUS&#8217;s operations and our financial condition. 

As described more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Environment- Recent Legislative and ED Activity - Federal Legislative Activity - Sequestration and Budgetary Matters,&#8221; in March 2013, in response to automatic across-the-board reductions in federal spending (also known as &#8220;sequestration&#8221;), each of the military services suspended new enrollments in DoD&#8217;s tuition assistance programs. As a result of Congressional action, each of the services reinstated enrollments in DoD tuition assistance programs in April 2013. However, our results of operations in the second quarter of 2013 were negatively impacted by these actions, resulting in what we believe were fewer enrollments from service members than otherwise would have been expected. 

In October 2013, DoD tuition assistance programs were temporarily suspended as a result of the partial U.S. government shutdown. On October 1, 2013, prior to the government shutdown, APUS&#8217;s course registrations for October 2013 were approximately 41,200. However, as of October 14, 2013, approximately 13,100 registrations had been dropped, resulting in a net course registration reduction of approximately 20% compared to October 2012. We believe that many of these dropped registrations resulted from the suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs. After the government shutdown ended, DoD resumed its tuition assistance programs; however, we do not believe that APUS&#8217;s registrations for subsequent periods replaced all of the dropped registrations. 

As a result of continued uncertainty about the availability of funding, several of the military branches announced changes to their tuition assistance programs that took effect in federal fiscal year 2014. For example, the Air Force is no longer authorizing tuition assistance for associates degrees if the service member already has an associates degree from the Community College of the Air Force, the Army now requires service members to complete one year of service after graduation from Advanced Individual Training in order to be eligible for tuition assistance, the Army has reduced the total annual benefit per service member from $4,500 to $4,000, and the Marine Corps now requires Marines to have 24 months on active duty prior to being eligible to apply for tuition assistance. In October 2015, the Coast Guard restored tuition assistance funding to $250 per semester hour, an increase from the previous cap of $187.50 per semester hour, which was implemented in 2014. For additional information regarding the risks associated with DoD tuition assistance programs, please refer to &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.&#8221; 

While DoD&#8217;s tuition assistance programs have been reinstated, subject to the modifications described above, budgetary pressures remain, and we do not know what future action will be taken with respect to DoD tuition assistance programs, which could include eliminating those programs, reducing the funds or benefits (or both) available under those programs, or enacting new restrictions on participation in those programs. Any such changes, or any other reductions in the funding for DoD tuition assistance programs, could have a material adverse effect on APUS&#8217;s enrollments and our financial condition. The potential risks associated with these and similar events are described more fully below in &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.&#8221; 

Faculty and Staff 

APUS&#8217;s faculty consists of approximately 2,210 &#32;full and part-time faculty members with relevant teaching and practitioner experience as well as a professional staff of approximately 950 &#32;non-faculty employees administering APUS&#8217;s academic, technology, service, and business operations. Most of APUS&#8217;s non-faculty employees work at either its headquarters in Charles Town, West Virginia, or at its administrative offices in Manassas, Virginia. None of APUS&#8217;s employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe that APUS has a good relationship with its employees. 

Approximately 410 &#32;faculty members are designated as full-time faculty with the remainder designated as part-time. APUS establishes full-time and part-time positions based on program and course enrollment. Many of APUS&#8217;s full-time faculty began their careers with APUS as part-time faculty. We expect that APUS&#8217;s faculty headcount and the composition of full-time and part-time faculty will vary with fluctuations in enrollment. 

We believe that APUS&#8217;s well-regarded faculty, which includes many former and current practitioners in their fields, attracts new students to APUS. A significant majority of APUS&#8217;s graduate faculty hold a doctorate in the relevant field, while virtually all undergraduate faculty have earned a graduate degree. Exceptions have been granted for a limited number of APUS&#8217;s faculty members who do not meet these degree standards but evidence significant experience and achievement in the field of study that they teach. Many APUS faculty members have relevant experience at leading universities and within military and government institutions. 

We believe that the quality of APUS&#8217;s faculty is critical to the student experience and student outcomes and is therefore vital to APUS&#8217;s success. APUS regularly reviews the performance of its faculty by, among other things, monitoring the amount of online contact that faculty have with students, reviewing student feedback, and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students. If APUS determines that a faculty member is not performing at an acceptable level it works with the faculty member to improve performance, including through assigning the faculty member a mentor. If the faculty member&#8217;s performance does not improve, APUS will no longer allow that faculty member to teach. APUS does not offer its faculty tenure. 

We believe that the composition of APUS&#8217;s student body and curriculum are particularly attractive to potential faculty members because of the opportunity to teach relevant material to students who can implement classroom lessons at their workplaces. APUS recruits faculty members through referrals by current faculty members, advertisements in education and trade association journals, and its internet presence. Upon selection for a position, APUS requires each new faculty member to complete an orientation and training program that leads to their certification to teach at APUS and assignment to courses. 

Information Technology 

APUS has invested significant capital and resources into developing proprietary information systems and processes to support what we refer to as Partnership At a Distance&#8482;, or PAD. PAD is APUS&#8217;s platform for interacting with APUS&#8217;s students. PAD is an information system designed to enable APUS to provide each student with individualized support at appropriate times from pre-enrollment through and beyond graduation, including student advising, administrative support, and community networking. 

APUS uses Sakai Collaboration and Learning Environment, or &#8220;Sakai CLE,&#8221; an open-source Learning Management System for its online classroom. There are approximately 350 educational institutions around the world reportedly using Sakai CLE to support teaching, learning, research, and collaboration. PAD and Sakai CLE are APUS&#8217;s two core enterprise systems. 

APUS has several other systems that are used to support financial aid processing, financial management, human resources processes, marketing, and decision support. 

The backbone of APUS&#8217;s information technology infrastructure consists of two data centers: one in Virginia, and one at a co-location facility in Texas. APUS&#8217;s technology environment is managed internally. Student access to APUS&#8217;s systems is provided through redundant data carriers in both data centers. We believe that APUS has established a functional, secure, and reliable technology system that helps support its mission. 

Information technology systems are an essential part of the APUS student experience and our business operations, and we continue to invest in technology operations and enhancements to support our systems and mission and evaluate when it is appropriate to make significant changes, modifications or upgrades. For example, in 2010, we selected Sakai CLE to replace APUS&#8217;s existing provider as the foundational software for APUS&#8217;s online classroom, and in 2015 APUS selected Global Financial Aid Services for financial aid processing services, which required meaningful information technology changes. These types of changes are not without risk to our operations and financial results. We continually evaluate our PAD system for possible changes and upgrades, and such changes and upgrades may result in us incurring significant costs that could affect our financial results in the near term. 

The performance and reliability of APUS&#8217;s networks and technology infrastructure, including those of third parties systems APUS uses, is critical to its reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure could interrupt APUS&#8217;s ability to operate and could result in the unavailability of its online classrooms, preventing students from accessing their courses and adversely affecting our results of operations. APUS&#8217;s technology infrastructure, and the technology infrastructure of its third-parties vendors, could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, cyber attacks, hacker or terrorist activities, and telecommunications failures. APUS&#8217;s computer networks, and the networks of its third-party vendors, may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, and other security problems. APUS performs security assessments on a periodic basis to review and assess its security. APUS utilizes this information to audit itself to ensure that it is adequately monitoring the security of its technology infrastructure. However, we cannot ensure that these security assessments and audits will protect APUS&#8217;s computer networks against the threat of security breaches. Similarly, although APUS requires its third-party vendors to maintain a level of security that is acceptable to us and works closely with its third-party vendors to address potential and actual security concerns and attacks, we cannot ensure that APUS and its systems and proprietary information or personal information about its students or employees will be protected against the threat of security attacks on third-party vendors that affect APUS systems or such information. System disruptions and security breaches to APUS&#8217;s online computer networks, technology infrastructure, or online classroom infrastructure, or to the networks, infrastructures and systems of third parties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.

Intellectual Property 

APUS exercises rights associated with patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect its intellectual property. APUS&#8217;s course syllabi are its property, may be used in current and future courses as needed to facilitate instruction, and may be modified to meet evolving course or curriculum requirements. Intellectual property of APUS&#8217;s individual faculty members remains the property of each such faculty member and is reserved specifically for use only by the faculty member who owns it, unless the faculty member grants permission for use by others. APUS relies on agreements under which it obtains rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third party content providers. 

APUS has secured rights to trademarks for various names and terms used in its business, including &#8220;American Public University System,&#8221; &#8220;American Military University,&#8221; &#8220;American Public University&#8221; and logos incorporating the foregoing terms and acronyms of those terms, as well as &#8220;Ready When You Are,&#8221; &#8220;Educating those Who Serve,&#8221; &#8220;RESPECTED. AFFORDABLE. ONLINE.&#8221; and the term &#8220;Partnership At a Distance.&#8221; We believe these trademarks and brand names are important to how prospective students identify APUS and are central to a number of its marketing efforts. APUS also owns rights to more than 200 internet domain names pertaining to APUS, AMU, APU and other unique descriptors. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued APUS a patent for PAD in February 2011. 

Competition 

Within the postsecondary education market, APUS competes primarily with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. APUS also competes in specific targeted markets, such as those discussed below. For additional information regarding APUS&#8217;s competitive environment, please refer to &#8220;Business - Company Overview.&#8221; 

APUS has focused on serving the military community since its founding as AMU, and the military market continues to be the primary market for APUS. Within the military market, there are more than 2,700 institutions that serve military students and receive funds through the DoD tuition assistance program. The primary competitors for military students are other institutions offering online instruction, and colleges and universities offering on-campus instruction located near military installations. Over the last several years, a number of APUS&#8217;s competitors have expanded their outreach and marketing efforts directed at active duty and reserve service members, as well as veterans. 

We believe that APUS will continue to see increased competition in the military community from both non-profit and for-profit schools. We believe that competition from for-profit schools will continue to increase as those schools seek to attract students eligible for DoD tuition assistance programs and VA education benefits, rather than ED&#8217;s Title IV programs, in an attempt to comply with ED&#8217;s regulatory requirement known as the 90/10 Rule. This regulatory requirement is described more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements&#8221;. 

Within the market for public safety professionals, such as law-enforcement personnel or other first responders, and non-military professionals and other working adults with extended and irregular work schedules, APUS faces broad competition with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. 

Hondros College of Nursing 

&#32;HCON is nationally accredited by the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS. HCON&#8217;s programs are generally designed to prepare individuals for productive careers in the field of nursing. HCON&#8217;s students principally receive instruction on-campus at one of HCON&#8217;s four campuses in Ohio, which are located in the suburban areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton. HCON also offers certain courses and its RN-to-BSN Program via online delivery. As discussed more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change of Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control,&#8221; HCON participates in ED&#8217;s Title IV programs pursuant to a Provisional Program Participation Agreement. 

Curriculum and Scheduling 

HCON offers on-campus instruction leading to a Diploma in Practical Nursing, or PN Program, and an Associate Degree in Nursing, or ADN program. Graduates of the PN Program are eligible to seek licensure as a licensed practical nurse after passing the NCLEX-PN exam. Graduates of the ADN Program are eligible to seek licensure as a registered nurse after passing the NCLEX-RN exam. HCON also offers online instruction leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, through its RN-to-BSN Program, for students who already possess an associate&#8217;s degree in the field. HCON&#8217;s programs are offered in a quarterly format. Academic terms for the PN and the ADN programs begin four times each year, with courses starting in January, April, July and October. In an effort to better serve students and increase enrollments, HCON has increased its offering of evening and weekend courses. 

Enrollment and Student Body 

HCON&#8217;s student enrollment as of December 31, 2015 , was approximately 1,520 &#32;students. This number includes those HCON students who enrolled in at least one course either on campus or online during 2015 . 

Accreditation 

HCON is accredited on the institutional level by ACICS, which is recognized by ED as a national accrediting agency. The RN-to-BSN Program has received programmatic accreditation from CCNE. The status and meaning of these accreditations and recognitions is described more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Accreditation.&#8221; 

Student Recruitment and Marketing 

&#160; 

HCON&#8217;s marketing strategy is focused on building long-term relationships with businesses, organizations and individuals in the healthcare community, primarily in Ohio. We believe this strategy will continue to generate a significant number of referrals. In addition, HCON utilizes traditional media as well as internet-focused marketing channels, including organic search, local display advertising and pay-per-click. 

Student Admissions 

HCON welcomes prospective students to apply for admission at any time by submitting an application along with an application fee. To be accepted into any HCON program, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, be at least 18 years old at the time of starting the program, and hold a high school diploma or General Education Development certificate. HCON&#8217;s programs also have program-specific admissions requirements. 

Applicants for both the PN Program and the ADN Program are required to complete an interview with an admissions representative, and complete and pass a criminal background check and a drug screening. Applicants for the PN Program are also generally required to take and pass the Health Education Systems Admissions Assessment, or HESI Exam. 

Applicants for the ADN program who graduated from the PN Program must have graduated from that program within two quarters of their enrollment in the ADN program, or must hold an active, unencumbered practical nurse license. Applicants for the ADN program who have not graduated from the PN Program must have completed their practical nursing training at an approved program, and must hold an active, unencumbered practical nurse license. 

Applicants for the RN-to-BSN Program must hold an active, unencumbered registered nurse license in the state in which they desire to complete their practicum. Applicants must also have graduated from an approved registered nursing program with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0, and must complete an interview with an admissions representative. Applicants applying to begin the RN-to-BSN Program in the quarter immediately following graduation from the ADN Program may be admitted without a license, but are required to obtain one prior to their third quarter in the RN-to-BSN Program. 

Cost of Attendance and Financial Aid 

HCON&#8217;s tuition costs vary among its three programs. HCON&#8217;s PN Program may be completed for approximately $19,065 in tuition and fees, the ADN program may be completed for approximately $30,175 in tuition and fees, and the RN-to-BSN Program may be completed for approximately $16,790 in tuition and fees. 

HCON&#8217;s students also incur costs for textbooks and supplies. These costs vary among HCON&#8217;s three programs and are paid for by HCON&#8217;s students as the textbooks or supplies are needed. HCON estimates that over the life of its programs a student&#8217;s costs related to textbooks and supplies will be approximately $2,723 for the PN Program, $4,382 for the ADN Program, and $1,723 for the RN-to-BSN Program. 

HCON&#8217;s students pay various other fees and charges, including application fees and graduation fees. Additionally, students in HCON&#8217;s PN program and ADN program, are charged a one-time fee of $489 for its technology package. HCON&#8217;s students also incur additional costs for uniforms, examination review materials, examination fees, and fees for applications with the Ohio Board of Nursing, among others. Some of these costs are payable to HCON and others are payable directly to third parties. 

Sources of Student Financing 

HCON&#8217;s students finance their education through a combination of individual resources, VA education benefits, ED&#8217;s Title IV programs, private loans, state and federal grants, and corporate reimbursement programs. Most HCON students rely on some form of financial aid in addition to their individual resources. The substantial majority of HCON&#8217;s revenue is derived from students utilizing ED&#8217;s Title IV programs, which results in increased regulatory risks, as discussed more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The &#8216;90/10 Rule.&#8217;&#8221; As a result, HCON&#8217;s management may find it necessary to decrease HCON&#8217;s exposure to Title IV students, which could have a negative impact on its operating results and our financial condition. 

While HCON does not currently participate in DoD&#8217;s tuition assistance programs it may attempt to do so in the future. Should HCON choose to participate in the DoD tuition assistance program, it will be subject to such program&#8217;s requirements and restrictions, which are more fully discussed in the &#8220;Our Institutions - American Public University System - Sources of Student Financing,&#8221; &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements,&#8221; &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity - Federal Legislative Activity - Sequestration and Budgetary Matters,&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; sections of this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Faculty and Staff 

HCON&#8217;s faculty consists of approximately 145 &#32;faculty members with relevant teaching and nursing or healthcare practitioner experience. HCON also employs approximately 80 &#32;staff members who administer HCON&#8217;s academic, technology, service, and business operations. HCON&#8217;s faculty and staff largely work at one of its four campuses. None of HCON&#8217;s employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe that HCON has a good relationship with its employees. 

Approximately 100 &#32;of HCON&#8217;s faculty members are designated as full-time faculty with the remainder designated as part-time faculty. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the PN Program must have earned the minimum of a bachelor&#8217;s degree in nursing. All faculty whose instruction is focused within the ADN Program and RN-to-BSN Program must have earned the minimum of a master&#8217;s degree. All HCON faculty whose instruction is nursing theory-based must have an active license to practice as a Registered Nurse. In addition to the formal education of HCON&#8217;s faculty, many have also obtained specialized certifications in the field of nursing. 

We believe that selecting well-educated and qualified faculty members is a key component to HCON&#8217;s success. In addition to having the necessary educational requirements, HCON seeks faculty who have demonstrated experience in the field of nursing. Almost all faculty who teach HCON&#8217;s nursing courses have nursing experience in a clinical setting, which we believe helps teach HCON&#8217;s students the skills needed to be effective and safe caregivers. 

HCON trains and develops new faculty through a formal, structured on-boarding, training, and mentoring program. All new HCON faculty members receive a 90-day on-boarding experience, which includes a formal orientation to the organization, policies and procedures, teaching strategies, performance expectations and role responsibilities. 

Information Technology 

In 2015, the hosting and maintenance of HCON&#8217;s information technology infrastructure was transitioned from a third-party affiliated with HCON&#8217;s previous ownership to APUS which provides services through an intercompany arrangement. For information regarding the security and reliability of APUS provided systems please refer to &#8220;Our Institutions - American Public University System - Information Technology.&#8221; 

Intellectual Property 

In connection with our acquisition of HCON, we received the right to the corporate name National Education Seminars, Inc. and a royalty-free, irrevocable, exclusive, transferable, sublicensable license to use the names &#8220;Hondros College&#8221; and &#8220;Hondros College of Nursing&#8221; (or, instead of &#8220;Nursing,&#8221; any other qualifier directly related to nursing, medicine or healthcare in connection with the business and operations of HCON). 

HCON exercises rights associated with copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and registrations to protect its intellectual property. 

Competition 

HCON competes with other schools offering nursing programs in the regions where it has campuses, including for-profit and not-for-profit public and private colleges. Because HCON&#8217;s RN-to-BSN Program is offered online, it also competes in a broader market against other online nursing programs. For additional information regarding HCON&#8217;s competitive environment, please refer to &#8220;Business - Company Overview.&#8221; 

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 

In the United States, postsecondary education institutions are overseen by a three-part regulatory framework comprised of (i) accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education, (ii) state regulatory bodies, and (iii) the federal government, through the U.S. Department of Education, or ED. Because APUS participates in military tuition assistance and APUS and HCON participate in veterans education benefits programs administered by the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, respectively, we are also subject to oversight by those agencies. The regulations, standards, and policies of these organizations cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and financial condition. 

The postsecondary education regulatory environment continues to become more complex. Applicable regulations, standards, and policies frequently change, and changes in, or new interpretations of existing regulations, standards, and policies, as well as applicable laws, could have material consequences for our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under federal student financial aid programs, and costs of doing business. In recent years ED has been actively issuing new rules which have had a substantial impact on the proprietary postsecondary education industry. For example, in 2010, ED adopted a new set of rules, which we refer to as the Program Integrity Regulations, which were generally effective on July 1, 2011, establishing significant new compliance requirements for institutions of higher education. In 2014, ED adopted a new set of rules, which we refer to as the Final GE Regulations, defining the circumstances under which an education program prepares students for &#8220;gainful employment in a recognized occupation,&#8221; as is required in order for students enrolled in such programs to be eligible to receive student financial aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. Certain portions of the Program Integrity Regulations and the Final GE Regulations are discussed in this Annual Report. 

Accreditation 

Accreditation is a voluntary, non-governmental process through which an institution or a program submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions, based on the standards of the accrediting agency and the stated aims and purposes of the institution or program. Accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions or programs, and publicly recognize those institutions or programs that meet the stated criteria. Accredited schools and programs are subject to periodic review by accrediting agencies to ensure continued high performance, institutional and program improvement, and institutional and program integrity, and to confirm that accreditation criteria 

continue to be satisfied. An institution or program that is determined not to meet the criteria may have its accreditation limited, revoked, or not renewed. 

Pursuant to provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or the HEA, ED relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether the academic quality of an institution&#8217;s educational programs is sufficient to qualify the institution to participate in student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA, or Title IV programs. &#32; Institutional accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education is also necessary to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. To be recognized by the Secretary of Education, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards and procedures for the review of educational institutions or programs. As described more fully above in each reporting segment&#8217;s &#8220;Our Institutions - Accreditation&#8221; section, each of our institutions are accredited by an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education: 

&#8226; 

American Public University System, or APUS, is institutionally accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, or HLC, a regional accrediting agency. In July 2011, HLC reaffirmed the accreditation status of APUS. In February 2017, HLC will conduct a site visit at APUS and perform a comprehensive evaluation as part of a mid-cycle review. The next comprehensive evaluation for reaffirmation of accreditation is scheduled for the 2020-2021 academic year. 

In 2015, as required by HLC in connection with the 2011 reaffirmation of accreditation, APUS submitted an interim progress report to HLC on the development of a university system-wide coordination and improvement of graduate studies and the report was subsequently accepted by HLC. HLC also from time to time may schedule site visits for other reasons, including a focused visit related to a change of control, structure or organization transaction, a substantive change, or conformity with HLC&#8217;s Criteria for Accreditation (related to topics such as teaching and learning, and resources). 

&#8226; 

Hondros College of Nursing, or HCON, is institutionally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS, a national accrediting agency. On August 13, 2013, ACICS acted to award HCON a new grant of accreditation through December 31, 2016. After completion of our acquisition of HCON, ACICS acted to reinstate HCON&#8217;s accreditation through December 31, 2016, effective from the date of the acquisition. During the first quarter of 2016, ACICS conducted a site visit at each of HCON&#8217;s campuses as part of ACICS&#8217; evaluation of HCON&#8217;s renewal of accreditation application. For more information, see &#8220;Regulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry.&#8221; 

Institutional accreditation is an important attribute of our institutions. Colleges and universities depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating a candidate&#8217;s credentials, and students, corporations, and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards. 

The National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, or NACIQI, is charged with advising the Secretary of Education on whether to recognize accrediting agencies for federal purposes, including for participation in Title IV programs. In December 2009, the ED Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, recommended that ED consider limiting, suspending, or terminating HLC&#8217;s recognition as an accreditor for purposes of determining institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. HLC received additional scrutiny in June 2010 during a House Education and Labor Committee hearing focused on OIG&#8217;s findings with regard to credit hour policies. In November 2015, ED announced several executive actions to increase transparency and rigor in accreditation, including an announcement that ED will ensure that NACIQI members have student outcomes data, state and federal litigation reports, and other information about the schools accredited by each accrediting agency. Increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the Secretary of Education and Congress in connection with ED&#8217;s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accrediting agencies. 

In December 2010, NACIQI reviewed HLC&#8217;s status as a recognized accrediting agency. At that time, NACIQI voted to continue HLC&#8217;s recognition as an accrediting agency but also ordered the agency to submit an additional compliance report in one year. At its December 2011 meeting, NACIQI characterized HLC&#8217;s report as &#8220;informational&#8221; and noted that no vote was to be taken on it. In June 2013, NACIQI voted to recommend continuation of HLC&#8217;s recognition as an accrediting agency until it reached a final decision on whether to re-recognize HLC. In June 2015, NACIQI voted to recommend that ED renew HLC&#8217;s recognition as an accrediting agency through December 2017. ED subsequently accepted NACIQI&#8217;s recommendation and continued HLC&#8217;s recognition through December 2017. If HLC were to lose its recognition as an accrediting agency, APUS could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs. For additional information 

regarding the risks associated with loss of accreditation please refer to the &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry&#8221; section of this Annual Report. 

In addition to institutional accreditation, we have obtained specialized accreditation or professional recognition for several specific programs at our institutions, as described more fully above in each reporting segment&#8217;s section entitled &#8220;Our Institutions - Accreditation.&#8221; Accreditation of a program by a specialized accrediting agency or granting of professional recognition by a professional organization signifies that the program meets the standards of that agency or organization. If we fail to satisfy the standards of these specialized accrediting agencies and professional organizations, we could lose the specialized accreditation or professional recognition for the relevant programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs, prevent us from offering the programs in certain states, or prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their desired fields or employment from particular employers. 

State Licensure/Authorization 

We are subject to extensive regulations by the states in which we are authorized to operate. The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state, and state regulations change frequently. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states may also prescribe regulations related to an institution&#8217;s financial condition, and some states require the posting of surety bonds. State laws and regulations may also affect our ability to offer educational programs, open locations, and award degrees. If we fail to comply with a state&#8217;s regulatory requirements, we may lose our state licensure or authorization, which would result in our inability to enroll students in that state, and could result in our inability to receive Title IV program funds and DoD tuition assistance funds, at least for students in that state. 

Some states assert authority to regulate an institution if its educational programs are offered to residents of those states, regardless of whether the institution maintains a physical presence in the state where the student resides. The increased popularity of online education has led and may further lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations in various states. States may also revise their regulations in this area as a result of future ED regulations, as discussed more fully below in &#8220;State Licensure/Authorization Requirements.&#8221; New laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business. For additional information regarding the risks related to the regulation of the internet, please refer to &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business.&#8221; 

Changes in our business or changes in the nature or amount of our contact with or presence within a particular state could lead states that do not currently require us to be licensed or authorized to require such licensure or authorization in the future. For example, programs that include &#8220;on the ground&#8221; components that may be described as instructional activities, such as student teaching and clinical internships, may be viewed by some state regulatory agencies as constituting a physical presence for regulatory purposes. As those programs expand, it is possible that we will need to seek formal authorization to operate in some states where historically we have not been required to do so. The extent of this expansion in regulatory requirements, and the associated costs, are not known at this time, but we anticipate they may be significant. Furthermore, there may be some states where it takes a significant amount of time to meet the applicable regulatory requirements with respect to a new program initiative, or where we are not able to do so at all. 

Many states also have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in a specified field. Students often seek to obtain professional licensure in their chosen fields after graduation. Their success in obtaining licensure typically depends on several factors, including, for example: the individual merits of the graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association; whether the program meets all state requirements for professional licensure; and the accreditation of the institution and the specific program. 

State Licensure/Authorization Requirements 

&#8220;Home&#8221; State Authorization 

The final Program Integrity Regulations adopted by ED address certain institutional and program eligibility issues, including state authorization. The Program Integrity Regulations specify how an institution may demonstrate that it is authorized to offer postsecondary educational programs by the state(s) where it is located, which we refer to as its &#8220;home&#8221; state. If requested by ED, an institution must be able to document its home state&#8217;s approval in order to participate in Title IV programs. In addition, the home state must have a process to review and take appropriate action on complaints concerning 

postsecondary institutions. ED has stated that it will not publish a list of states that meet, or fail to meet, these requirements. If ED determines that an institution does not have the required state approval, the institution will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs. After ED stayed implementation of the home state authorization rules from July 1, 2011 to July 1, 2015, the rules were implemented effective July 1, 2015. We cannot predict the extent to which ED will determine that the institutional authorization or complaint review process of any state satisfies ED&#8217;s regulations. If one of our institutions were to lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs because it failed to obtain authorization by the state in which it is located or because a state&#8217;s institutional authorization and complaint process did not satisfy ED&#8217;s requirements, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

State Authorization of Online Education 

In November 2013, ED announced its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking panel to consider regulations for, among other issues, state authorization of programs offered through distance education. Negotiated rulemaking sessions occurred in the winter and spring of 2014, but the negotiating committee did not reach consensus. In June 2014 ED announced that it would delay the release of proposed rules regarding state authorization for distance education. ED had included provisions regarding state authorization for distance education in the Program Integrity Regulations, which provided that, if an institution offered postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state, it was required to obtain any necessary state approvals to do so. However, on June 5, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia&#8217;s July 12, 2011 ruling upholding ED&#8217;s power to promulgate regulations on state authorization for distance education but vacating on procedural grounds those provisions of the Program Integrity Regulations. In a Dear Colleague Letter dated July 27, 2012, ED warned that while it cannot enforce the vacated provision, institutions continue to be responsible for complying with all state laws as they relate to distance education. No assurance can be given with respect to whether ED will adopt new rules on state authorization for distance education or, in the event that such regulations are adopted, our ability to comply with the new regulations. 

SARA 

The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement, or SARA, is a voluntary agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. SARA is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a National Council and administered by four regional education compacts, which accept applications from states in their regions to join SARA. SARA requires states to approve institutions in their state to participate in SARA, based upon institutional accreditation and financial stability, and to resolve student complaints. SARA membership is open to degree-granting postsecondary institutions from all sectors, including public colleges and universities as well as non-profit and for-profit independent institutions. An institution must be accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. SARA member states agree to impose no additional (non-SARA) authorization requirements on institutions from other SARA states. For SARA purposes, an institution&#8217;s &#8220;home state&#8221; is the state where its main campus or central unit holds its principal legal domicile. SARA shifts principal oversight responsibilities from the state in which the distance education is being received to the &#8220;home state&#8221; of the institution offering the instruction. For purposes of SARA, an institution has a physical presence in a state and therefore must meet the state&#8217;s non-SARA licensure requirements if it conducts certain activities in a state. Membership in SARA was opened to states in January 2014. The State of West Virginia joined SARA effective December 1, 2014. APUS&#8217;s initial application to become a SARA institution was approved on December 8, 2014, and APUS has been a participating SARA institution since that time. 

State Authorization/Licensure of Our Institutions 

APUS is physically headquartered in the State of West Virginia, with administrative offices in the Commonwealth of Virginia. At present, APUS enrolls students from each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia. APUS is currently authorized to offer its programs by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, or WVHEPC, the regulatory agency governing postsecondary education in the State of West Virginia. We believe that under current law the only state authorization or licensure necessary for APUS to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs is its authorization from WVHEPC. We believe the same is true for Title IV programs. Failure to comply with the requirements of WVHEPC could result in APUS losing its authorization from WVHEPC, its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance, or its ability to offer certain programs, any of which could force APUS to cease operations. 

Due to APUS having administrative offices located in Virginia, under Virginia law APUS is also required to be authorized by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, or SCHEV. Accordingly, APUS has obtained SCHEV&#8217;s authorization to operate as an out-of-state institution in Virginia. 

Since December 2014, APUS has been a participating institution in SARA, which is described more fully above, resulting in APUS being authorized through reciprocity in 34 SARA states. West Virginia is a SARA state but, as discussed above, APUS is required to be authorized by the WVHEPC due to West Virginia being its home state. Virginia is a SARA state but, as discussed above, APUS is required to be authorized in Virginia due to having administrative offices located within Virginia; therefore, SCHEV&#8217;s regulation of APUS is outside the scope of SARA. Additionally, APUS has obtained licensure or authorization to operate or conduct activities in three states that have not joined SARA. APUS has also sought and received confirmation that its operations do not require state licensure or authorization, or has been notified that it is exempt from licensure or authorization requirements, in 11 states. 

HCON is physically headquartered in Westerville, Ohio, and has four campuses in Ohio. HCON is currently authorized to offer its programs by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, the regulatory agency that is responsible for authorizing for-profit and non-profit private career schools offering associate degree, certificate, and diploma programs in the State of Ohio. HCON&#8217;s Practical Nursing Diploma and Associate Degree in Nursing programs are approved by the Ohio Board of Nursing. HCON&#8217;s online completion program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing is approved by the Ohio Department of Higher Education, the regulatory agency in Ohio responsible for authorizing education programs at the bachelor&#8217;s degree level and above. HCON is approved as an out-of-state institution by the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education and the Nevada Commission on Postsecondary Education. As of December 31, 2015, HCON is not a participating SARA institution. 

Failure to comply with state authorization or licensure requirements could restrict our institutions&#8217; ability to recruit or enroll students in certain states or result in other sanctions being imposed on our institutions, including fines and penalties. In some cases, state authorization or licensure may impose limitations on certain activities and may impose particular requirements with respect to certain programs. We review the licensure requirements of states to determine whether our institutions&#8217; activities in those states may constitute a presence or otherwise may require authorization or licensure by the respective state education agencies. We cannot predict the extent to which SARA will impact our institutions&#8217; regulatory burden and costs, whether states will join and retain membership in SARA, the manner in which SARA&#8217;s rules will be interpreted and enforced by SARA&#8217;s member states, APUS&#8217;s ability to comply with SARA&#8217;s requirements and retain membership eligibility, or the impact that failure to meet the SARA requirements may have on our business. To date, state-specific limitations and requirements have not had a material effect on our institutions&#8217; operations. However, new laws, regulations, interpretations, or changed circumstances related to our institutions&#8217; educational programs could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students and offer programs in particular states, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions&#8217; enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business. 

Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements 

Our students finance their education through a combination of Title IV programs administered by ED, tuition assistance programs administered by the DoD, education benefits administered by the VA, private loans, corporate reimbursement programs, and individual resources. Participation in federal student aid programs, including those administered by DoD and VA, adds to the regulation of our operations. In particular, the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny in the form of numerous standards we must satisfy in order to participate in and administer Title IV programs. 

Department of Education 

The federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through Title IV programs, in the form of grants and loans to eligible students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified by ED to participate in Title IV programs, provided the student&#8217;s program satisfies Title IV program eligibility requirements. An institution may participate in Title IV programs only if it is certified to do so and it enters into a written program participation agreement, or PPA, with the Secretary of Education. The PPA conditions initial and continued participation in Title IV programs upon compliance with ED regulations, including regulations applicable to individual Title IV programs, and any additional conditions specified in the PPA. 

Types of Title IV Financial Aid Programs . 

Title IV program aid is primarily awarded to students on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending an institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute to that cost. All recipients of Title IV program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study. In addition, each school must ensure that Title IV program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts and in a timely manner to eligible students. 

Students at our institutions receive grants and loans to fund their education under several Title IV programs, of which the two largest are Direct Loans and Pell Grants. Students at our institutions are eligible to participate in the following Title IV programs: 

(1) Federal Student and Parent Loans . &#32; ED&#8217;s most significant form of aid includes loans to students and their parents through the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, or Direct Loan Program. Direct Loan Program loans are made directly by the federal government to students or their parents. The Direct Loan Program offers Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loans, Federal Grad PLUS Loans and Federal Consolidation Loans. Prior to July 1, 2010, students could obtain loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, or FFEL Program, in addition to or instead of Direct Loan Program loans, depending on the federal loan program in which their school participated. The FFEL Program was eliminated through legislation enacted in March 2010, and, after June 30, 2010, Federal Stafford Loans, Federal Parent PLUS Loans, Federal Grad PLUS Loans, and Federal Consolidation Loans may only be made through the Direct Loan Program. 

Federal Stafford Loans, or Stafford Loans, may either be subsidized or unsubsidized. A student with demonstrated financial need may be eligible to receive a subsidized Stafford Loan where ED pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled at least half-time in school and during the first six months after leaving school. A student without demonstrated financial need may be eligible to receive an unsubsidized Stafford Loan where the student is responsible for the interest that accrued while in school and after leaving school. Students who are eligible for a subsidized Stafford Loan may also be eligible to receive an unsubsidized Stafford Loan. Federal Parent PLUS Loans, or Parent PLUS Loans, may be obtained by the parents of a dependent undergraduate student in an amount not to exceed the difference between the total cost of that student&#8217;s education (including allowable expenses) and other aid to which that student is entitled. Students who are classified as independent, and dependent students whose parents are unable to obtain Parent PLUS Loans, can receive additional unsubsidized Stafford Loans. Federal Grad PLUS Loans, or Grad PLUS Loans, are available to graduate or professional students enrolled at least half-time. The obligation to begin repaying federal loans does not commence until six months after a student ceases enrollment as at least a half-time student. Federal Consolidation Loans allow a student who has graduated, left school, or dropped below half-time enrollment to combine multiple federal education loans into one loan with one interest rate and one monthly payment. 

&#32; (2) Federal Grant Programs . Pell Grants are ED&#8217;s primary program for grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The maximum amount of availability of a Pell Grant is $5,730 for the 2014-2015 award year, $5,775 for the 2015-2016 award year, and $5,815 for the 2016-2017 award year. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, or the Appropriations Act, amended the HEA to reduce the income threshold for an automatic zero &#8220;expected family contribution&#8221; for both dependent and independent students, which for some students decreased the amount of their Pell Grants. The Appropriations Act also amended the HEA to reduce the duration of a student&#8217;s lifetime eligibility to receive a Pell Grant from 18 semesters (or its equivalent) to 12 semesters (or its equivalent). This may eliminate the ability of some of our students to continue to receive Pell Grants, depending on their prior receipt of Pell Grants from our institutions and from other institutions prior to enrolling in one of our schools. 

The Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant, or FSEOG, program provides grant awards designed to supplement Pell Grants for the neediest undergraduate students. The availability of FSEOG awards is limited by the amount of those funds allocated by ED to an institution under a formula that takes into account the size of the institution, its costs, and the income levels of students. 

The &#32; Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant, or TEACH Grant, program provides grant assistance to undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, and graduate students who agree to serve for at least four years as full-time &#8220;highly qualified&#8221; teachers in high-need fields in public or not-for-profit private elementary or secondary schools that serve students from low-income families. Due to sequestration, the maximum award for any TEACH Grant first disbursed on or after October 1, 2015 and before October 1, 2016 was reduced to $3,728 from an earlier maximum of $4,000. 

(3) Federal Work-Study . Under the Federal Work-Study program, ED pays a share, generally 75%, of the cost of part-time employment of eligible students, based on their financial need, to perform work for the institutions they attend, or for off-campus public or non-profit organizations. 

Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs 

To be eligible and certified to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the Secretary of Education, must be authorized to operate by the appropriate regulatory authority in each state where the institution maintains a physical presence, and must comply with specific standards and procedures set forth in the HEA and the regulations issued thereunder by ED. 

ED periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations. Accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing compliance of institutions with Title IV program requirements. As a result, our institutions are subject to extensive oversight and review. For all these reasons, we cannot predict with certainty how Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. See &#8220;Recent Legislative and Regulatory Activity&#8221; below for more information. Key provisions relating to institutional participation in Title IV and the processing of Title IV aid that could adversely affect us include the following: 

Eligibility and Certification Procedures. &#32; An institution must apply periodically to ED for continued certification to participate in Title IV programs. Recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change of control. An institution may come under review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new program, or, in certain cases, when it modifies academic credentials that it offers. 

ED may place an institution on provisional certification status if ED finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all Title IV requirements and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is initially certified or undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control. During a period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its PPA. In addition, ED may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school, or make any other significant change. If ED determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its PPA, it may seek to revoke the institution&#8217;s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. 

APUS is fully certified to participate in Title IV programs through September 30, 2020. HCON was deemed to have undergone a change of ownership and control in November 2013, requiring review by ED in order to reestablish eligibility and continue participation in Title IV programs. As described more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control,&#8221; in January 2016 we received a letter from ED approving the change in ownership and control and granting HCON provisional certification to participate in the Title IV programs until December 31, 2018. HCON received a fully executed provisional program participation agreement in February 2016. HCON &#32; must comply with specific conditions while it is provisionally certified, as described more fully in &#8220;Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs,&#8221; below. 

State Authorization. &#32; To participate in Title IV programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies. As described more fully above in &#8220;State Licensure/Authorization,&#8221; ED has specified the types of state approvals that are acceptable to demonstrate that an institution is authorized to offer educational programs beyond the secondary level by the state where it is located. 

Administrative Capability. &#32;Current ED regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite &#8220;administrative capability&#8221; to participate in Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things: 

&#8226; 

comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations; 

&#8226; 

have capable and sufficient personnel to administer Title IV programs; 

&#8226; 

have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students; 

&#8226; 

not have cohort default rates above specified levels; 

&#8226; 

have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds; 

&#8226; 

not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; 

&#8226; 

provide financial aid counseling to its students; 

&#8226; 

refer to ED&#8217;s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs; 

&#8226; 

submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations; 

&#8226; 

report annually to the Secretary of Education on any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a private education lender or group of lenders to any employee who is employed in the institution&#8217;s financial aid office, or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans; 

&#8226; 

develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve discrepant information with respect to a student&#8217;s application for Title IV aid; and 

&#8226; 

not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. 

If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, ED may require the repayment of federal student financial aid funds, transfer the institution from the &#8220;advance&#8221; system of payment of Title IV program funds to cash monitoring status or to the &#8220;reimbursement&#8221; system of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs. 

Financial Responsibility. &#32; The HEA and ED regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions must satisfy in order to participate in Title IV programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the services described in its official publications and statements, properly administer Title IV programs in which it participates, and meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds and any repayments to ED for debts and liabilities incurred in programs administered by ED. 

ED evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards. The financial responsibility standards include a complex formula that uses line items from the institution&#8217;s audited financial statements. The formula focuses on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institution&#8217;s capital resources, financial viability, and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institution&#8217;s viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institution&#8217;s profitability or ability to operate within its means). Generally, an institution&#8217;s financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further federal oversight. Under certain circumstances, an institution may be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis. 

ED may also apply the financial responsibility standards to an eligible institution&#8217;s parent ownership entities. At the request of ED, for purposes of evaluating the financial responsibility of our institutions, including the composite score calculation, we supply consolidated financial statements to ED. 

Failure of one of our institutions to meet the &#8220;financial responsibility&#8221; requirements, because it does not meet the minimum composite score to establish financial responsibility or is unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, or because it fails to meet other financial responsibility requirements, could cause the institution to lose access to Title IV program funding, or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation. Because ED may also apply the financial responsibility standards to an eligible institution&#8217;s ownership entities, ED&#8217;s determination that our Consolidated Financial Statements do not satisfy the &#8220;financial responsibility&#8221; requirements could cause both APUS and HCON to lose access to Title IV program funding, or result in other penalties or conditions on continued participation. 

The &#8220;90/10 Rule.&#8221; &#32; A requirement of the HEA, commonly referred to as the &#8220;90/10 Rule,&#8221; applies only to &#8220;proprietary institutions of higher education,&#8221; which includes for-profit schools like our institutions. Under this rule, a proprietary institution is prohibited from deriving from Title IV programs, on a cash accounting basis (except for certain institutional loans) for any fiscal year, more than 90% of its revenue (as computed for 90/10 Rule purposes). If an institution violates the 90/10 Rule for any fiscal year, the institution is placed on provisional status for two fiscal years. An institution that violates the rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years and is required to demonstrate compliance with Title IV eligibility and certification requirements for at least two fiscal years prior to resuming Title IV program participation. ED discloses on its website any proprietary institution of higher education that fails to meet the 90/10 requirement, and reports annually to Congress the relevant ratios for each proprietary institution of higher education. 

Using the applicable 90/10 formula, the following table contains the percentage of cash-basis revenue earned from Title IV program funds. 

&#160; 

2013 

APUS 

43% 

46% 

47% 

HCON 

75% 

81% 

87% 

We continue to monitor compliance with the 90/10 Rule. 

The 90/10 Rule has been a subject of interest over the past several Congresses which has resulted in several members of Congress introducing proposals and legislation that would modify the 90/10 Rule. One previous Congressional proposal would decrease the limit on Title IV funds from 90% to 85% and would have counted DoD tuition assistance and GI Bill education benefits toward that limit. Further, the President&#8217;s 2016 Budget proposed the inclusion of DoD tuition assistance and GI education benefits in the 90% portion of the 90/10 calculation. Such proposals, or other similar legislation, should they become law, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of our institutions. 

Incentive Payment Rule. &#32; As part of an institution&#8217;s Title IV program participation agreement with ED and in accordance with the HEA, an institution may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or federal student financial aid. Failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in termination of participation in Title IV programs, limitation on participation in Title IV programs, or financial penalties. Under regulations effective July 1, 2011, ED eliminated 12 &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; under the incentive payment rule and codified a stricter reading of the rule. 

On March 24, 2015, the ED Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, issued a final audit report titled &#8220;Federal Student Aid&#8217;s Oversight of Schools&#8217; Compliance with the Incentive Compensation Ban.&#8221; In its report, OIG concluded that ED&#8217;s Office of Federal Student Aid failed to (i) revise its enforcement procedures and guidance after ED eliminated the safe harbors, (ii)develop procedures and guidance on appropriate enforcement action, and (iii) properly resolve incentive compensation ban findings. In response to the report, OIG and the Office of Federal Student Aid agreed on corrective action that may increase scrutiny and enforcement action related to payment of incentive compensation. 

On June 2, 2015, ED released a memorandum regarding enforcement of the prohibition on the payment of incentive compensation by postsecondary institutions to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admissions activities, or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance based directly or indirectly upon success in securing enrollments or financial aid. Institutions agree to comply with the incentive compensation rules as a condition of their participation in the Title IV aid program. The memorandum indicated that ED will revise its approach to measuring damages for noncompliance with the prohibition against incentive compensation. In administrative enforcement actions, ED will calculate the amount of the institutional liability based on the cost to ED of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to ED of all of the Title IV funds received by the institution over a particular period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which &#32; students were recruited in violation of the incentive compensation prohibition. ED may also impose a fine upon an institution, or take administrative action to limit, suspend, revoke, deny, or terminate an institution&#8217;s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, if the institution violates &#32; the prohibition. We are currently unable to predict the impact that ED's revised approach to measuring damages under the incentive compensation prohibition might have on our financial condition if one of our institutions is found to be in violation of the prohibition. 

We believe that our employee compensation and third-party contractual arrangements comply with the incentive payment rule currently in effect. However, certain ambiguities in the final rule, ED&#8217;s accompanying statements in the rule release, and guidance issued by ED in March 2011 and June 2015, create uncertainty as to how the revised rule will be interpreted and enforced by ED. In light of these uncertainties, or otherwise, we can make no assurances that ED would not find deficiencies in our past, current, or future employee compensation plans and relevant third-party contractual arrangements. 

In addition, in recent years, other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants to whistleblower lawsuits, known as &#8220;qui tam&#8221; cases, brought pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that an institution&#8217;s compensation practices did not comply with the incentive compensation rule. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert management&#8217;s time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit. 

Gainful Employment. &#32;Under the HEA, as amended, proprietary schools are generally eligible to participate in Title IV programs only in respect of educational programs that prepare students for &#8220;gainful employment in a recognized occupation.&#8221; Historically, this concept has not been defined in detailed regulations. Final regulations adopted by ED, which generally became effective on July 1, 2011, and which we refer to as the Program Integrity Regulations, address certain institutional and program eligibility issues, including gainful employment. Under the Program Integrity Regulations, all institutions must use a template designed by ED to disclose to prospective students, with respect to each gainful employment program, occupations that the program prepares students to enter, total cost of the program, on-time graduation rate, job placement rate, if applicable, and the median loan debt of program completers for the most recently completed award year. The Program Integrity Regulations included additional rules pertinent to gainful employment programs. A federal court struck down these additional rules and left the disclosure requirements in place. 

In September 2013, ED convened a negotiated rulemaking committee, which we refer to as the Gainful Employment Rulemaking Committee, to prepare proposed regulations to replace those struck down by the federal court. The Gainful Employment Rulemaking Committee met in the fall of 2013, but did not achieve consensus on regulatory language. On October 31, 2014, ED published the final regulations related to gainful employment, which we refer to as the Final GE Regulations. On May 27, 2015, a U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York dismissed a suit brought by the Association of Proprietary Colleges&#8217;, which challenged the Final GE Regulations. On June 23, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed a separate suit brought by the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, or APSCU, which also challenged the Final GE Regulations. APSCU appealed the District Court&#8217;s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Oral argument for the appeal was held on January 22, 2016, and the final result is pending. On July 1, 2015, the Final GE Regulations went into effect, with the exception of new disclosure requirements, which take effect January 1, 2017. 

The Final GE Regulations establish debt-related measures for determining whether certain postsecondary education programs prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Final GE Regulations set forth two debt-to-earnings measures: an annual earnings rate, and a discretionary income rate. A program will pass the measures if the program's graduates have annual loan payments: 

&#8226; 

less than or equal to 8% of their total earnings; or 

&#8226; 

less than or equal to 20% of their discretionary income. 

A program that does not pass either of the debt-to-earnings measures and that has an annual earnings rate that is greater than 8% and less than or equal to 12%, or a discretionary income rate that is greater than 20% and less than or equal to 30%, will be in a warning &#8220;zone.&#8221; A program fails the measures if its annual earnings rate is greater than 12% (or the denominator of the rate (annual earnings) is zero) and its discretionary income rate is greater than 30% (or the income for the denominator of the rate (discretionary earnings) is negative or zero). 

Pursuant to the Final GE Regulations, and subject to the potential for adjustments based on a transition period, a program will become ineligible for Title IV funding if it fails both debt-to-earnings measures twice in three consecutive years, or if the program is in the warning &#8220;zone&#8221; for four consecutive years. An institution will be required to provide warnings to students, including prospective students, when notified by ED that a program could become ineligible based on its final debt-to-earnings measures for the next award year. 

In addition to the debt-to-earnings measures, the Final GE Regulations include new requirements related to gainful employment programs. For example, the Final GE Regulations require an institution&#8217;s most senior executive officer to certify, as part of the program participation agreement, that each eligible gainful employment program offered by the institution satisfies certain requirements related to institutional and programmatic accreditation and professional licensure or certification exam requirements. Also, the Final GE Regulations expand upon the existing gainful employment program disclosure requirements; the new disclosure requirements are effective January 1, 2017. A failure to comply with the Final GE Regulations could result in our institutions losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions&#8217; enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business. 

Student Loan Defaults. &#32; Under the HEA, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV programs if defaults on the repayment of FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program loans by its students exceed certain levels. 

Pursuant to the Higher Education Opportunity Act enacted in 2008, or the HEOA, which amended the HEA, an institution&#8217;s cohort default rate, or three-year cohort default rate, is calculated as the percentage of borrowers in the cohort who default before the end of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the borrowers entered repayment. ED calculates a single cohort default rate for each federal fiscal year that includes in the cohort all current or former student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any FFEL Program or Direct Loan Program loan during that year. Beginning with the three-year cohort default rate for the 2011 cohort published by ED in September 2014, three-year cohort default rates are applied for purposes of measuring compliance with the requirements. For previous years, the applicable cohort default rate, or two-year cohort default rate, was calculated as the percentage of borrowers in the cohort who defaulted before the end of the first fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the borrowers entered repayment. Pursuant to ED requirements, if the three-year cohort default rate for any year after 2011 exceeds 40%, an institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, and if the institution&#8217;s three-year cohort default rate exceeds 30% for three consecutive years, beginning with the 2009 cohort, the institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If an institution's cohort default rate is equal to or greater than 30% in any year after 2011, it must establish a default prevention task force. 

In September 2015, ED released APUS's and HCON's official three-year cohort default rates for federal fiscal year 2012. The final official ED cohort default rate for the federal fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012 are as follows: 

&#160; 

2011 

APUS 

11.9% 

13.0% 

23.3% 

HCON 

12.7% 

12.1% 

11.8% 

If one or both of our institutions has a default rate in excess of allowable levels, it could result in that institution&#8217;s or those institutions&#8217; loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or incurring additional costs related to default prevention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Privacy of Student Records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, and the Department of Education&#8217;s FERPA regulations require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students&#8217; educational records by limiting an institution&#8217;s disclosure of a student&#8217;s personally identifiable information without the student&#8217;s prior written consent. FERPA also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution, to notify students at least annually of their rights under FERPA, and to maintain records in each student&#8217;s file listing certain requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, ED may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution&#8217;s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In addition, educational institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, a federal law designed to protect consumers&#8217; personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers. GLBA and the applicable GLBA regulations require an institution, to among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive, written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents, or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective actions, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC. Institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC with respect to their collection, use and disclosure of student information. Institutions must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a section of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts. 

College Affordability and Transparency Lists. &#32;As required by the HEOA, ED publishes on its website lists of the top 5% of institutions, in each of nine categories, with (i) the highest tuition and fees for the most recent academic year, (ii) the highest &#8220;net price&#8221; for the most recent academic year, (iii) the largest percentage increase in tuition and fees for the most recent three academic years, and (iv) the largest percentage increase in net price for the most recent three academic years. An institution that is placed on a list for high percentage increases in either tuition and fees or in net price must submit a report to ED explaining the increases and the steps that it intends to take to reduce costs. ED reports annually to Congress on these institutions and publishes its reports on its website. ED also posts lists of the top 10% of institutions in each of the nine categories with lowest tuition and fees or the lowest net price for the most recent academic year. Under the HEOA, net price means average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students who receive student aid at a higher education institution after such aid is deducted. For 2013-2014, APUS was listed as the institution with the seventh lowest tuition and seventh lowest net price among private for-profit, four-year or more institutions. We cannot predict with certainty the effect such lists will have on our operations. 

College Scorecard. &#32;President Obama directed ED to develop and publish a new college ratings system by the 2015-2016 school year. On December 19, 2014, ED issued a framework for the college ratings system. On June 25, 2015, ED stated that in lieu of creating its previously announced college ratings system, it would instead create a consumer-driven website that will allow users to compare colleges based on measures that may be of importance to them. In September 2015, ED publicly released its &#8220;College Scorecard&#8221; website. Among other characteristics, the College Scorecard allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation. We do not believe the College Scorecard is an appropriate indicator of APUS's graduation rate because the College Scorecard's graduation rate includes only the performance of first time, full-time undergraduate students, which represents less than approximately 1% of all APUS students. Furthermore, substantially all of the other College Scorecard measures are based on data collected only about students who receive Title IV program aid. While a significant portion of APUS students receive Title IV program aid, in total they are a minority of APUS's students. We cannot predict the extent to which the College Scorecard may impact our institution's enrollments, reputation, or operating results. 

Third-Party Servicers. &#32; ED regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution&#8217;s participation in Title IV programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. An institution must report to ED new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers as well as other matters related to third-party servicers. If any third-party servicer that we engage does not comply with applicable statute and regulations including the HEA, we may be liable for its actions, and we could lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. 

Title IV Return of Funds. &#32; Under ED&#8217;s return of funds regulations, when a student withdraws, an institution must return unearned funds to ED in a timely manner. An institution must first determine the amount of Title IV program funds that a student &#8220;earned&#8221; before withdrawal. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV programs, in a specified order, the lesser of (i) the unearned Title IV program funds or (ii) the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date of the institution&#8217;s determination that a student withdrew. 

If funds are not timely returned, an institution may be subject to adverse action, including being required to submit a 

letter of credit equal to 25% of the refunds the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under ED regulations, late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institution&#8217;s annual compliance audit constitute material noncompliance for which an institution generally must submit an irrevocable letter of credit. HCON&#8217;s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2012 identified a deficiency related to timely return of Title IV program funds. In a Preliminary Audit Determination Letter dated July 10, 2013, ED requested additional information from HCON about the situation and required HCON to conduct a file review to identify those files that reflected an inaccurate refund. HCON was required to post an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $128,290, which expires in July 2016. ED had indicated that the matter will be addressed as part of its review of HCON&#8217;s application for a change of ownership, which is described more fully below in &#8220;Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control.&#8221; 

Misrepresentation. Under the HEA and its implementing regulations, ED may fine, suspend or terminate the participation in Title IV programs by an institution that engages in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. In the future, ED could promulgate regulations that expand its role in monitoring and enforcing prohibitions on misrepresentation. For information regarding a recent ED finding of substantial misrepresentation at HCON based on circumstances that occurred prior to our acquisition of HCON, see &#8220;Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control.&#8221; 

Credit Hours. The HEA and current regulations use the term &#8220;credit hour&#8221; to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV program funds an institution may disburse during a payment period. The Program Integrity Regulations define the previously undefined term &#8220;credit hour&#8221; in terms of a certain amount of time in class and outside class, or an equivalent amount of work. The Program Integrity Regulations also require accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution&#8217;s credit hour assignments. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institution&#8217;s programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If ED determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, ED could require the institution to repay any incorrectly awarded amounts of Title IV program funds. In addition, if ED determines that an institution has significantly overstated the amount of credit hours assigned to a program, it may fine the institution, or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in Title IV programs. 

VAWA and Clery . On April 1, 2014, a negotiated rulemaking committee, convened by ED, reached consensus on proposed regulations to address implementation of the changes made by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, or VAWA, to section 485(f) of the HEA, otherwise known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, or the Clery Act. On October 20, 2014, ED promulgated final regulations to implement changes made by VAWA, the Final VAWA Regulations. The Clery Act requires an institution to report to ED and disclose in its annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred on or within the institution&#8217;s so-called &#8220;Clery geography.&#8221; Under the Final VAWA Regulations, an institution must report and disclose statistics about, for example, crimes of &#8220;dating violence,&#8221; &#8220;domestic violence,&#8221; and &#8220;stalking,&#8221; as defined by the Final VAWA Regulations. Also, under the Final VAWA Regulations, an institution&#8217;s annual security report must include certain statements about what an institution will do to assist persons who allege that they have been a victim of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking; in addition, an institution must publish in its annual security report procedures for 

institutional disciplinary action in such cases. The Final VAWA Regulations require institutions to provide &#8220;primary prevention programs&#8221; for incoming students and new employees and &#8220;ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns&#8221; for students and employees, and to describe these programs and campaigns in their annual security report. A failure to comply with the Final VAWA Regulations could result in our institutions being fined or having our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs limited, suspended, or terminated, which could, in turn, adversely affect our institutions&#8217; enrollments and revenue and have a material effect on our business. 

Borrower Defenses. On June 8, 2015, ED issued a fact sheet where it announced debt relief mechanisms that it asserts are designed to hold for-profit institutions accountable. The announcement specifically addresses debt relief for students at Corinthian Colleges&#8217; institutions that closed and Corinthian Colleges&#8217; institutions that did not close, but the fact sheet is framed more broadly. In the fact sheet, ED discusses the ability to discharge federal student loans, which we refer to as Federal Direct Loans, when an institution closes. Generally, pursuant to ED's regulations, when an institution closes, students are eligible to discharge their Federal Direct Loans if they were attending the institution when it closed or had withdrawn within 120 days of the closing date. ED also points out that ED's regulations provide Federal Direct Loan recipients with a defense against an attempt to collect their Federal Direct Loans based on an act or omission of the institution that would give rise to a cause of action under applicable state law. ED indicates that such provision has &#8220;rarely been used in the past&#8221; and that it is taking &#8220;unprecedented action&#8221; with respect to Corinthian Colleges students to extend debt relief to such students wherever possible. In the fact sheet, ED also announced plans to develop new regulations to &#8220;clarify and streamline loan forgiveness&#8221; under the loan discharge provision. 

On October 20, 2015, ED announced that it would establish a new negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations for determining which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a student borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program (&#8220;borrower defenses&#8221;) and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and ED. ED further announced that the rulemaking committee is intended to address (i) the procedures to be used for a borrower to establish a defense to repayment; (ii) the criteria that ED will use to identify acts or omissions of an institution that constitute defenses to repayment of Federal Direct Loans; (iii) the standards and procedures that ED will use to determine the liability of the institution participating in the Federal Direct Loan Program for amounts based on borrower defenses; (iv) the effect of borrower defenses on institutional capability assessments; and (v) other loan discharges. The rulemaking committee met in January 2016. We are unable to predict when ED may ultimately issue regulations on these topics, the result of any other current or future rulemakings or the impact of such rulemakings on our business. If ED determines that borrowers of Federal Direct Loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their Federal Direct Loans based on a state law claim, the repayment liability to ED could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Cash Management Regulations: On October 27, 2015, ED announced the publication of final regulations to amend ED's cash management regulations, which we refer to as the Cash Management Regulations. The Cash Management Regulations go into effect on July 1, 2016. Among other topics, the Cash Management Regulations address arrangements between postsecondary institutions and financial account providers to disburse Title IV Program credit balances to students, including through the use of debit or prepaid cards. The Cash Management Regulations require institutions to establish a process to facilitate student choice in how students receive Title IV Program federal student financial aid credit balances; limit the personally identifiable information about students that may be shared with financial account providers; and require institutions to obtain student consent before opening an account in the student&#8217;s name. Under the Cash Management Regulations, an institution that has entered into an arrangement with a financial account provider must mitigate certain fees incurred by Title IV aid recipients, and certain types of fees are prohibited. The Cash Management Regulations require that contracts governing arrangements with financial account providers be publicly disclosed and evaluated in light of the best financial interests of students. The Cash Management Regulations also make other changes to requirements for the institutional administration of Title IV Programs, including by clarifying how previously passed coursework is treated for Title IV eligibility purposes, altering the requirements for converting clock hours to credit hours, and updating other provisions in ED&#8217;s cash management regulations. For example, the Cash Management Regulations establish a requirement that institutions participating in the Title IV Programs under the reimbursement or heightened cash monitoring payment methods must pay any credit balance due to a student before seeking reimbursement or a request for funds. The Cash Management Regulations also specify the circumstances under which an institution may include the cost of books and supplies as part of institutional tuition and fees charged to a student, such as if the institution has made arrangements with publishers to obtain books at below-market rates or if books or electronic course materials are not available elsewhere. The Cash Management Regulations also expand the group of students to whom an institution must provide a way to obtain or purchase, by the seventh day of a payment period, the books and supplies applicable to the payment period. Previously, an institution was required to provide such assistance only to students who receive Pell Grants, but under the Cash Management Regulations, an institution will be required to provide such assistance to any student who is eligible for Title IV Program aid. Our institutions utilize a third party servicer to provide services related to the disbursement of Title IV financial aid credit balance refunds. We are currently unable to predict the 

impact that compliance with the Cash Management Regulations might have on our operations and operating results. 

Department of Defense 

Service members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the DoD, or DoD tuition assistance programs. Service members may use this tuition assistance to pursue postsecondary degrees at institutions that are accredited by accrediting agencies recognized by the Secretary of Education. For students in APUS undergraduate programs, we have established tuition rates per semester credit hour that under current DoD policies can be 100% covered by DoD tuition assistance funds provided that the student does not exceed the annual limits per student. At this time, HCON does not participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. 

Under a DoD final rule effective January 7, 2013, each institution participating in DoD tuition assistance programs is required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and DoD prior to being permitted to participate in the DoD tuition assistance programs. In May 2014, DoD promulgated new regulations and a revised MOU, the 2014 MOU. On July 7, 2014, DoD released revisions to the 2014 MOU, and APUS signed the revised 2014 MOU in August 2014. The 2014 MOU contains requirements and limitations that were not contained in previous MOUs to which APUS was a party. Pursuant to the 2014 MOU, among other requirements, institutions must: explain certain ED and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, tools to service members, such as ED&#8217;s &#8220;College Navigator&#8221; website and the CFPB&#8217;s &#8220;Paying for College&#8221; website; comply with requirements related to readmission policies for service members; abide by new limitations on the use of funds derived from tuition assistance; provide additional academic and student support services; disclose information about transfer of credit; in certain circumstances, return tuition assistance funds to DoD (such as when a student ceases to attend or an institution cancels a course); offer to service members loan counseling before private student loans are offered or recommended; and comply with ED's Title IV &#8220;program integrity&#8221; rules, including rules related to incentive payments and misrepresentation. The 2014 MOU also provides that an institution may only participate in DoD tuition assistance programs if it is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED, approved for VA funding, and a participant in Title IV programs. Additional information regarding the potential risks associated with the 2014 MOU are addressed in the "Risk Factors" section of this Annual Report. 

On March 14, 2013, DoD issued an instruction restricting the ability of service members in certain duty locations outside the continental United States, or overseas locations, to receive DoD tuition assistance for courses offered by institutions of higher education that are not parties to contracts with the DoD to provide DoD voluntary education programs at those locations. Because we do not have contracts with the DoD to provide instruction at overseas locations, service members who begin a postsecondary education program after arrival in an applicable overseas duty location may not use DoD tuition assistance programs to pay for their education in our programs until after they have already successfully completed a course with an institution that has entered into a contract to provide voluntary education programs at that overseas location. Service members who were already enrolled in one of our programs before arriving at an overseas duty location may continue to receive DoD tuition assistance for the in-progress program, but they will be encouraged to enroll in courses provided by institutions that have entered into contracts with the DoD to provide programs at the applicable overseas duty location. 

On January 30, 2014, the DoD, VA, ED, and FTC, in collaboration with the CFPB and Department of Justice, announced a new online student complaint system for service members, veterans, and their families to report negative experiences at education institutions and training programs administering the Post-9/11 GI Bill, DoD tuition assistance programs, and other military-related education benefit programs. The complaint system is designed to help the government identify and address unfair, deceptive, and misleading practices. The complaint system is based on President Obama&#8217;s April 27, 2012 Executive Order 13607, EO 13607, which requires federal agencies to create a centralized complaint system for students receiving federal military and veterans educational benefits to register complaints that can be tracked and responded to by relevant agencies. An institution having recurring substantive complaints, or demonstrating an unwillingness to resolve complaints, may face a range of penalties, including revocation of its MOU and removal from participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs. 

Department of Veterans Affairs 

The VA administers education benefits provided by federal law, including the Montgomery GI Bill, or GI Bill, and the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, or Post-9/11 GI Bill. Pursuant to federal law related to those programs, APUS is approved to provide education to veterans and members of the selective reserve and their dependents by the state approving agencies in West Virginia and Virginia. Programs at each of HCON&#8217;s campuses are approved for VA benefits by the state approving agency in Ohio. 

The Post-9/11 GI Bill expanded education benefits for veterans who have served on active duty since September 11, 2001, including reservists and members of the National Guard, as well as benefits available under the GI Bill. The Post-9/11 GI Bill expanded the ability of service members to transfer their benefits to family members. The Post-9/11 GI Bill also provides veterans up to $1,000 per academic year for books, supplies, equipment, and other education costs. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, or Improvements Act, revised the calculations of benefits related to tuition and fees under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. For a veteran attending a non-public U.S. institution, the Improvements Act provides tuition and fees based on the net cost to the veteran (after accounting for state and federal student financial aid, scholarships, institutional aid, fee waivers, and similar assistance), up to $21,084.89 per year. Veterans pursuing a program of education on a more than half-time basis at an on-campus location are eligible for a monthly housing allowance equal to the basic allowance for housing available to service members who are at a military pay grade E-5 and have dependents. Veterans pursuing a program of education solely through distance education on a more than half-time basis are eligible to receive $783 per month. 

To the extent that DoD tuition assistance programs do not cover the full cost of tuition for service members, eligible service members may also use their benefits under the GI Bill or the Post-9/11 GI Bill through the &#8220;Top-Up&#8221; program. The &#8220;Top-Up&#8221; program allows active-duty service members to use their GI Bill or Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to pay the difference between the total cost of a college course and the amount of DoD tuition assistance that is paid by the military for the course, but is limited to 36 months of payments. 

Additional Sources of Student Payments 

In addition to the Title IV, DoD, and VA programs described above, eligible students may participate in several other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental and private sources. Some of our students finance their own education or receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers. Our institutions may offer interest free payment plans of less than 12 months to students to assist them with the financing of educational expenses. Our institutions enter into agreements with various employers who provide employee tuition reimbursement plans. Through these agreements our institutions agree to a variety of terms, including terms related to the provision of tuition grants to eligible employees. In certain circumstances, our students may access alternative loan programs from private lenders. Alternative loans from private lenders are intended to cover the difference between what the student receives from all financial aid sources and certain costs of the student&#8217;s education. Students can apply to a number of different private lenders for this funding. As part of an institution&#8217;s Title IV PPA, the institution must adopt a code of conduct pertaining to student loans, including alternative loans. 

Consumer Protection 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The CFPB has pursued enforcement actions against certain for-profit institutions of higher education and has released several reports that directly address issues related to institutions of higher education. On August 29, 2012, the CFPB submitted a report to several Congressional committees entitled &#8220;Private Student Loans.&#8221; The report contained specific suggestions for Congressional action to restructure the student lending experience, including possibly requiring institutions to certify that a student is not eligible for any further federal student financial aid funds before a private loan may be issued to such student. On October 18, 2012 the CFPB released a report entitled &#8220;The Next Front? Student Loan Servicing and the Cost to Our Men and Women in Uniform.&#8221; The report details the challenges that some service members have encountered when utilizing private and federal student loans. In October 2015, the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman released its annual report analyzing more than 6,400 complaints the CFPB received from private student loan borrowers between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015. We do not know what enforcement actions the CFPB may pursue, or what steps Congress or federal agencies may take, in response to these reports and whether such actions (if any) will have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. 

On January 31, 2013, the CFPB encouraged institutions of higher education, students, and others to provide information to the CFPB about the financial products and services currently offered to students, and comments on how current and future arrangements between higher education institutions and financial institutions could be structured in order to promote positive financial decision-making among consumers. In response to those comments, the CFPB issued its findings on campus banking products during a forum held in September 2013. In December 2013 and again in February 2014, the CFPB issued a request asking financial institutions to voluntarily make available on their websites agreements with colleges and universities to market deposit accounts, prepaid cards, debit cards, and other financial products to students. In February 2014, the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, issued a report on college debit cards in which the GAO recommended that Congress consider requiring financial institutions that provide debit and prepaid card services to colleges and universities to publicly disclose their agreements. The GAO report included a letter from ED, concurring with GAO&#8217;s recommendations and indicating that the issue would be considered by the Program Integrity and Improvement negotiated rulemaking committee scheduled to meet in spring 

2014. On October 27, 2015, ED released the Cash Management Regulations discussed above in &#8220;Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs.&#8221; 

On February 21, 2013, the CFPB issued a Notice and Request for Information soliciting input on affordable repayment options for borrowers with existing student loans. Based on the comments received, in May 2013, the CFPB issued a report analyzing the impact of student loan burdens and proposing a number of policy and market-based solutions. On December 3, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule that allows the CFPB to supervise certain &#8220;larger&#8221; nonbank federal and private student loan servicers for the first time, effective March 1, 2014. 

In July 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin stating that any entity subject to the CFPB&#8217;s jurisdiction, whether a third-party collector or a creditor collecting its own debts, can be held accountable for any unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in collecting a consumer&#8217;s debts. In November 2013, the CFPB issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking announcing that it is considering whether rules governing the collection of debts are warranted under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA, or other CFPB authorities, and, if so, what types of rules would be appropriate. As part of its proposed rulemaking, the CFPB sought comments about applying a regulatory regime similar to the FDCPA, which applies only to third-party debt collectors, to first-party debt collectors. Should the CFPB issue rules regulating first-party debt collectors such rules might apply to our institutions, which may adversely impact our collections efforts. 

On December 23, 2014, the CFPB issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM, proposing to establish disclosure requirements for prepaid accounts, such as reloadable cards that institutions may use to refund students&#8217; credit balances. The proposed rule would require financial institutions to provide certain disclosures to consumers prior to and after the acquisition of a prepaid account, including disclosure of terms and fees, and posting sample account agreements online. 

In August 2015, the CFPB issued a civil investigative demand, or CID, to ACICS, the accrediting agency that accredits HCON. The CID required ACICS to provide documents and testimony, to identify all schools it has accredited since January 1, 2010, and to identify the individuals involved in ACICS&#8217;s reviews of certain schools, not publicly identified. In September 2015, ACICS submitted a petition to the CFPB to set aside the CID, arguing that ACICS is not under the CFPB&#8217;s jurisdiction. ACICS argued that it does not provide any financial product or service nor does it assist or support its accredited institutions in procuring and maintaining loans from ED. In October 2015, the CFPB rejected ACICS&#8217;s petition and filed a petition to enforce the CID in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. We are unable to predict the impact that the CFPB CID may have on ACICS or its practices. 

Other Issues Related to Consumer Protection and Complaints 

Concurrent with release of the Final GE Regulations, ED announced that it will lead an effort to formalize an interagency task force to help ensure oversight of for-profit higher education institutions. In particular, ED and other federal and state agencies will coordinate their activities and promote information sharing to protect students from unfair, deceptive, and abusive policies and practices. ED explained that the task force will build on existing efforts among various federal agencies, and will include the Departments of Justice, Treasury, VA, the CFPB, the FTC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. State attorneys general will be invited to participate as well. According to ED, the task force will formalize and strengthen a working group that has been working together over the past year and that has coordinated efforts in several reviews and investigatory work. The task force will meet at least once each quarter. 

Many states have become more active in regulating proprietary education from a consumer protection perspective, specifically related to enforcement of consumer protection laws and implementation of new regulations by state attorneys general. For example, a group of state attorneys general, led by the Attorney General of Kentucky, are examining the for-profit education industry. The Kentucky Attorney General&#8217;s website reports that approximately 30 state attorneys general are participating. While we have a strong track record of regulatory compliance, such activities, even if not directed at one of our institutions, may make our operating environment more challenging. 

Our institutions are recipients of complaints filed with state regulatory authorities, the Better Business Bureau, and posted in online forums. Our institutions attempt to resolve such complaints in a cooperative manner. However, even if such complaints are resolved or are otherwise unfounded they may still harm the reputation of our institutions. 

Compliance with Regulatory Standards and the Effect of Regulatory Violations 

Compliance Reviews 

Our institutions are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including ED, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, agencies that guarantee FFEL Program loans, DoD, VA, and accrediting agencies. The HEA and ED regulations also require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable ED Office of Inspector General audit standards. In addition, to enable the Secretary of Education to make a determination of financial responsibility, institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with ED regulations. 

The DoD MOU requires institutions to participate in the DoD Third Party Assessment to ensure that the institution is in compliance with the DoD MOU and that service members are provided quality voluntary education opportunities that meet their needs. A Third Party Assessment of AMU was conducted in June 2012 with a revised report submitted in October 2012. The report stated that, based on the assessment team&#8217;s findings, AMU and APUS were in compliance with the DoD MOU that APUS executed. 

Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations &#32; 

If our institutions fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV programs, ED could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring our institutions to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV program funds, requiring the posting of a letter of credit in favor of ED as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against our institutions, referring the matter for criminal prosecution, or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend, or terminate participation in Title IV programs. If such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against our institutions and resulted in a substantial curtailment, or termination, of participation in Title IV programs, our institution&#8217;s enrollments, revenue, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. If APUS&#8217;s approval to participate in Title IV programs is terminated, APUS will also lose its ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs pursuant to the DoD MOU, which would materially and adversely affect our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition. 

If one of our institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or if the amount of available Title IV program funds were reduced, we could seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. Although we believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to students attending our institutions, there is no assurance that this would be the case, and the interest rate and other terms of such financial aid might not be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds. We may be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing alternative sources of financial aid. Accordingly, the loss of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available federal student financial aid, would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid. 

In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in Title IV programs, we also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public. 

Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations 

Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with our operations are also subject to regulation from a variety of agencies. ED&#8217;s regulations, state regulatory requirements and accrediting agency standards may, in certain instances, limit our ability to acquire or sell institutions, and to establish additional locations and programs. Many states require approval before institutions can add new programs, campuses, or teaching locations. HLC, WVHEPC, SCHEV, ACICS, the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, and the Ohio Department of Higher Education generally require institutions to notify them, and sometimes require institutions to obtain their approval, in advance of opening a new location or implementing new programs. 

Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control 

ED&#8217;s regulations, state regulatory requirements and accreditation standards may limit our ability to acquire, merge, or sell institutions, and may impose restrictions on activities following a transaction. These restrictions may impede our ability to grow by acquisition, or to dispose of assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 

A change in control could occur as a result of future transactions in which we are involved, such as corporate reorganizations or changes in the Board of Directors. Moreover, as a publicly traded company, the potential adverse effects of a change in control could influence future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control could discourage bids for your shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares. 

U.S. Department of Education 

The HEA provides that an institution which undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to ED in order to reestablish such eligibility. ED&#8217;s regulations provide that a change in control of a publicly traded company occurs in one of two ways: (i) if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing a change in control, or (ii) if the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock, or ceases to be the largest stockholder. As a result, a significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock, including an acquisition resulting in a stockholder owning at least 25% of our outstanding stock, could be determined by ED to be a change in ownership and control pursuant to ED&#8217;s regulations. 

Upon a change in ownership and control, an institution is ineligible to receive Title IV program funds during the period prior to recertification. The HEA provides that ED may temporarily provisionally certify an institution seeking approval of a change in ownership and control based on preliminary review of a materially complete application received within 10 business days after the transaction. ED may continue such temporary provisional certification on a month-to-month basis until it has rendered a final decision on the institution&#8217;s application. If ED determines to approve the application after a change in ownership and control, it issues a provisional certification, which extends for a period expiring not later than the end of the third complete award year following the date of provisional certification. ED&#8217;s regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change in ownership and control, including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institution&#8217;s parent corporation. 

When a change in ownership and control occurs, ED applies certain financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review and approval of the change. The institution generally is required to submit a same-day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership. The institution&#8217;s same-day balance sheet must demonstrate an acid test ratio of at least 1:1, which is calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities (and excluding all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables). The same-day balance sheet must demonstrate positive tangible net worth. In addition, when a change in ownership and control occurs and there is a new owner, the institution must submit to ED audited financial statements of the institution&#8217;s new owner&#8217;s two most recently completed fiscal years that are prepared and audited in accordance with ED requirements. ED may determine whether the financial statements meet financial responsibility standards with respect to the composite score formula. If the institution does not satisfy these requirements, ED may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institution&#8217;s agreement to letters of credit, provisional certification, and additional monitoring requirements. The composite score formula and related ED conditions are described more fully above in &#8220;Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Financial Responsibility&#8221;. If the new owner does not have the required audited financial statements, ED may impose certain restrictions on the institution, including with respect to adding locations and programs. 

On November 1, 2013, as a result of our purchase of all of the outstanding stock in National Education Seminars, Inc., HCON was deemed to have undergone a change of ownership and control requiring review by ED in order to reestablish eligibility and continue participation in Title IV programs. As required under ED&#8217;s regulations, we timely submitted a change in ownership application and required documentation. In January 2016, we received a letter from ED approving the change in ownership and control of HCON and granting HCON provisional certification to participate in Title IV programs until December 31, 2018. HCON received a fully executed provisional program participation agreement in February 2016. HCON must comply with specific conditions while it is provisionally certified, as described more fully in &#8220;Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs,&#8221; below. Prior to receiving ED&#8217;s approval of the change in ownership and control and as 

part of ED&#8217;s post-closing review, in May and December 2014 ED requested additional information related to a putative class action brought against HCON by two former HCON students that was settled in exchange for a de minimis &#32;settlement payment, with HCON admitting to no wrongdoing; we provided the requested information to ED shortly after it was requested. On December 4, 2015, ED sent HCON a letter informing HCON that ED had determined to fine HCON $27,500. The fine was based on ED&#8217;s review of the submitted information and a finding that HCON had substantially misrepresented its programmatic accreditation status during a time period prior to our ownership of HCON. On December 18, 2015, HCON responded to ED in a letter in which it noted its disagreement with ED&#8217;s findings but informed ED of its decision to pay the fine in order to promptly resolve the matter and to enable ED to finalize its review of the application for a change in ownership. HCON paid the fine in December 2015. 

State Regulatory Agencies 

Many states require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary among state regulatory agencies. Many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval. A change in control under the definitions of a state agency that regulates us may require us to obtain approval of the change in ownership and control in order to maintain our state approval. Under certain circumstances, WVHEPC and the SCHEV may require us to seek approval of changes in ownership and control in order to maintain APUS&#8217;s state authorization or licensure. 

We were required to seek, and we obtained, approval from the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools and the Ohio Department of Higher Education for the change in ownership and control of HCON. In the future, if we attempt to acquire other institutions, the states regulating the target institutions may require us to seek approval, which may or may not be granted. 

Accreditors 

Many accrediting agencies require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval for certain changes in ownership or other aspects of institutional status, but the types of and triggers for such reporting or approval vary among states and accrediting agencies. 

HLC, the accrediting agency for APUS, requires HLC accredited institutions to inform HLC in advance of any substantive change. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to HLC include changes in the legal status, ownership, or form of control of the institution, such as the sale of a for-profit institution. HLC must approve a substantive change in advance in order to include the change in the institution&#8217;s accreditation status. HLC also requires an on-site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval. 

Pursuant to policies adopted in 2009 and 2010, HLC oversight extends to defined changes that occur in an institution&#8217;s parent or controlling entity, and not necessarily in the institution itself. Actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including a significant acquisition of another institution, significant changes in board composition or organizational documents, and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than 25% of the capital stock could trigger additional reviews of the institution and possible change from accredited status to candidate status, which enhances the risks associated with these types of actions. In particular, a change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution&#8217;s ability to participate in Title IV programs. 

ACICS, the accrediting agency for HCON, requires ACICS-accredited institutions to inform ACICS in advance of any substantive change. Examples of substantive changes requiring advance notice to ACICS include changes in the legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution. An institution must notify ACICS of a change of ownership at least 15 days before consummating the proposed change, and ACICS must act to reinstate the institution&#8217;s accreditation status after the change of ownership. ACICS also requires an on-site evaluation within six months to confirm the appropriateness of the approval. HCON timely notified ACICS of the November 1, 2013 change of ownership, and on December 20, 2013, ACICS granted to HCON a reinstatement of accreditation through December 31, 2016, effective from the date of the change. ACICS conducted on-site quality assurance visits in the summer of 2014 and found HCON to be in compliance with accreditation criteria. During the first quarter of 2016, ACICS conducted a site visit at each of HCON&#8217;s campuses as part of ACICS&#8217; evaluation of HCON&#8217;s renewal of accreditation application. 

Should we attempt to enter into transactions with institutions accredited by other accreditors, we would be required to follow the requirements of such accreditors. Our management may not have experience with the accreditors of the target 

institution, which would increase the risks related to such a transaction and management of the institution subsequent to the transaction. 

Other Agencies 

Pursuant to federal law providing benefits for veterans and reservists, APUS is approved for education of veterans and members of the selective reserves and their dependents by the state approving agencies in West Virginia and Virginia. Programs at each of HCON&#8217;s campuses are approved for VA benefits by the state approving agency in Ohio. In certain circumstances, state approving agencies may require an institution to obtain approval for a change in ownership and control. The state approving agency in Ohio approved the November 1, 2013 change of ownership of HCON. However, there is no guarantee that relevant state approving agencies will approve future transactions. 

Restrictions on Adding Locations and Educational Programs 

ED may, as a condition of certification to participate in Title IV programs, require prior approval of new campus locations, programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. ED&#8217;s regulations also require that it approve any change in ownership resulting in a change of control. As described above in &#8220;Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control,&#8221; HCON was deemed to have undergone a change of ownership and control on November 1, 2013 requiring review by ED in order to reestablish eligibility and continue participation in Title IV programs. In January 2016, we received a letter from ED approving the change in ownership and control of HCON and granting HCON provisional certification to participate in the Title IV programs until December 31, 2018. HCON received a fully executed Provisional Program Participation Agreement, or PPPA, in February 2016 . While provisionally certified, HCON operates under the PPPA, which requires HCON to apply for and receive approval from the Secretary of Education before initiating any substantial changes, such as establishing an additional location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered and Title IV program funds will be disbursed, offering academic programs at higher than the bachelor&#8217;s degree level, or adding a new education program. 

The HEA requires proprietary institutions of higher education to be in full operation for two years before qualifying to participate in Title IV programs. However, the applicable regulations in many circumstances permit an institution that is already qualified to participate in Title IV programs to establish additional campus locations that are exempt from the two-year rule. The new campus location must satisfy all other applicable requirements for institutional eligibility, including approval of the additional campus location by the relevant state authorizing agency and the institution&#8217;s accrediting agency. ED&#8217;s regulations also require institutions to report and, in certain cases (such as when an institution is provisionally certified), to seek approval for a new additional campus location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered if the institution wants to disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at that location. Institutions are responsible for knowing whether they need approval, and institutions that add locations and disburse Title IV program funds without having obtained any necessary approval may be subject to administrative repayments and other sanctions. Under the PPPA, HCON must obtain ED approval for the addition of any additional location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered and Title IV program funds will be disbursed. 

A fully certified degree-granting institution generally is not obligated to obtain ED&#8217;s approval of an additional program leading to a degree at the same level previously approved by ED. Similarly, a fully certified institution generally is not required to obtain advance approval for a new program that both prepares students for gainful employment in the same or related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated as an eligible program at that institution and meets certain minimum-length requirements. However, as a condition of certification to participate in Title IV programs, ED could require prior approval of such programs or otherwise restrict the number of programs an institution may add. In the event that an institution is required to obtain ED&#8217;s approval for the addition of a new program, fails to do so, and erroneously determines that the new educational program is eligible for Title IV program funds, the institution could be liable for repayment of Title IV program funds received by the institution or students in connection with that program. 

Recent Legislative and ED Activity 

Federal Legislative Activity 

As a result of budgetary pressures, Congress has enacted several pieces of legislation that impact the funding of Title IV and other tuition assistance programs. Due to the substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through Title IV programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and significant political interest in the cost of education, Congress continues to show interest in regulation and oversight of institutions of higher education, especially those that are for-profit. 

Sequestration and Budgetary Matters 

On August 2, 2011, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011 which put into place a series of automatic federal budget cuts, known as sequestration. The budget cuts, or sequestration, impact certain federal student aid programs. While the Pell Grant program was specifically exempted from the effects of sequestration in fiscal year 2013 and the Fiscal Year 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Bill increased the maximum award to $5,915 in the 2016-2017 award year, the Pell Grant program could be subject to cuts or changes in the future. While sequestration does not otherwise change the amount or terms or conditions of Direct Loan Program loans, including Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, it raises the loan fee paid by borrowers for Direct Loan Program loans disbursed after March 1, 2013. Cuts to ED&#8217;s administrative budget could lead to delays in student eligibility determinations, and delays in origination and processing of federal student loans. 

After sequestration took effect in March 2013, the Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps announced the suspension of their tuition assistance programs. Congress subsequently approved legislation requiring DoD to restore its tuition assistance programs. In October 2013, the DoD tuition assistance programs were again temporarily suspended as a result of the U.S. government partial shutdown. Each branch of the military restored its tuition assistance program through fiscal year 2014. As a result of continued uncertainty about the availability of funding, several of the military branches announced changes to their tuition assistances programs that took effect in federal fiscal year 2014. For example, the Air Force is no longer authorizing tuition assistance for associate&#8217;s degrees if the service member already has an associate&#8217;s degree from the Community College of the Air Force, the Army now requires service members to complete one year of service after graduation from Advanced Individual Training in order to be eligible for tuition assistance, the Army has reduced the total benefit per service member per year from $4,500 to $4,000, and the Marine Corps now requires Marines to have 24 months on active duty prior to being eligible to apply for TA. In October 2015, the Coast Guard restored tuition assistance funding to $250 per semester hour, an increase from the previous cap of $187.50 per semester hour which was implemented in 2014. Additional changes to the tuition assistance programs could occur, including due to Congressional action or DoD policy and funding changes. 

Higher Education Act 

The HEA must be periodically reauthorized by the U.S. Congress and each Title IV program must be funded through appropriations acts on an annual basis. The most recent comprehensive reauthorization occurred in 2008 when Congress reauthorized most HEA programs through the 2014 federal fiscal year by passing the HEOA. Although the current HEA authorization expired at the end of the 2014 federal fiscal year, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 extended funding for Title IV programs through September 30, 2016. 

Congress continues to discuss reauthorization of the HEA. Amendments to the HEA could occur during reauthorization, which could require us to modify our business practices and increase administrative costs, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations. 

Regulatory Activity 

ED&#8217;s Accreditation Initiative 

On November 6, 2015, ED announced several executive actions to increase transparency and rigor in accreditation. ED announced the launch of a new ED website on which it has published each accreditor&#8217;s current standards related to student outcomes and student and institutional metrics. ED will require all accreditors to forward to ED probation decision letters, the publicly releasable portions of which ED will publish on its website. ED also announced the request of a report on strategies to improve information coordination between and among accreditors and ED. ED announced that it will ensure decision-makers in the accreditor recognition process, such as members of NACIQI, have information including outcomes data, state and federal litigation reports, and other information about each agency&#8217;s schools. Acknowledging that its authority related to accreditation 

and student outcomes is restricted under the HEA, ED also made several proposals for legislative change related to accreditation. 

ED&#8217;s Student Aid Enforcement Unit 

On February 8, 2016, ED announced the creation of a Student Aid Enforcement Unit to enable ED to respond more quickly and efficiently to allegations of illegal actions by higher education institutions. The Enforcement Unit will consist of four divisions, including an Investigations Group, a Borrower Defense Group, an Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group, and a Clery Group. The Enforcement Unit will collaborate with partner state and federal agencies to enforce violations of law. The Enforcement Unit will also work with ED&#8217;s Program Compliance Unit to review evidence that may affect program reviews. The creation of the Enforcement Unit is designed to ensure that ED can support more reviews of what it refers to as &#8220;high-risk institutions,&#8221; respond to concerns raised by states&#8217; and other federal agencies&#8217; investigations, and respond to complaints and claims for loan forgiveness by students. The Enforcement Unit will be led by a lawyer who most recently led the FTC&#8217;s consumer protection unit. As part of the 2017 budget, the President is requesting $13.6 million in additional funds to strengthen ED&#8217;s enforcement and oversight activities. ED has indicated that the new Investigations Group will utilize a broad set of interventions and tools, including subpoena authority, document demands, and interrogatories and interviews to enforce against violations of federal law. 

Pending Federal Rulemakings 

On July 9, 2015, ED published an NPRM that proposes to amend the regulations governing the Federal Direct Loan Program to create a new income-contingent repayment plan in accordance with the President&#8217;s initiative to allow more Federal Direct Loan borrowers to cap their loan payments at 10% of their monthly incomes. In addition, the regulations propose to streamline and enhance existing processes and provide additional support to struggling borrowers, including, among other things, establishing new procedures for FFEL Program loan holders to identify service members who may be eligible for benefits under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Also, the proposed regulations would expand the circumstances under which an institution could challenge or appeal a draft or final cohort default rate. We cannot predict the extent to which any rules promulgated by ED will impact our institutions, nor can we predict possible regulatory burdens and costs. 

The States 

As discussed above in &#8220;Consumer Protection - Other Issues Related to Consumer Protection and Complaints,&#8221; many states have become more active in regulating proprietary education from a consumer protection perspective, specifically in regards to enforcement of consumer protection laws and implementation of new regulations by state attorneys general. Since our institutions operate in many jurisdictions our institutions may be subject to regulations promulgated by a variety of regulators.
