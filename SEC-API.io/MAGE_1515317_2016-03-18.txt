 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION 

About Our Company 

Magellan Gold Corporation ( &#8220; Magellan &#8221; , &#8220; the Company &#8221; , &#8220; our &#8221; or &#8220; we &#8221; ) was formed and organized effective September 28, 2010, under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are an exploration stage company and our principal business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources in Arizona, California and Nevada. We have not presently determined whether the properties to which we have mining rights contain mineral deposits that are economically recoverable. 

We were formed and organized by Athena Silver Corporation ( &#8220; Athena &#8221; ), a Delaware corporation, and by John C. Power and John D. Gibbs, two of the control persons and principal shareholders of Athena. Effective September 2010, we issued an aggregate of 33 million shares of common stock to our founders in consideration of $.0025 per share: 30 million shares were issued to Messrs. Power and Gibbs and 3 million shares were issued to Athena. During 2011, the majority of the shares issued to Athena were distributed, in the nature of a spin-off dividend of such shares, to the shareholders of Athena, as of a Record Date of December 31, 2010, pro rata.

Our initial focus was on two mining leases secured in 2010 to explore 70 unpatented lode claims known as the &#8220; Secret Claims &#8221; in Washoe County, Nevada and 10 unpatented lode claims known as the &#8220; Randall Claims &#8221; in Churchill County, Nevada. We did not renew these leases after the Silver District option was signed in August 2012 and it became our flagship project. 

In August 2012, we entered into an Option Agreement with Columbus Silver (US) Corporation ( &#8220; Columbus &#8221; ) to purchase &#8220; The Silver District Claims &#8221; consisting of 85 unpatented lode mining claims, 4 patented lode claims, an Arizona State Exploration Permit of 154.66 acres and 23 unpatented mill site claims, totaling over 2,000 acres in La Paz County, Arizona. The underlying claims are subject to third party lease and or purchase obligations and net smelter royalties of varying percentages. In June and July 2013, Magellan staked 9 additional unpatented lode mining claims in the Silver District adjacent to the land package under option from Columbus; the Company currently retains 2 of these original 9 claims.

Effective September 29, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Columbus Silver (US) Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Columbus Exploration Corporation (TSXV:CLX) to purchase the patented and unpatented mining claims that had been covered by the Option Agreement. The Purchase Agreement superseded the Option Agreement and conveyed the Silver District Claims to the Company. In consideration of the Silver District Claims, we made a one-time payment to Columbus in the amount of $100,000. Following our purchase of the Silver District Claims, we formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary &#8220; Gulf + Western Industries, Inc. &#8221; ( &#8220; Gulf + Western &#8221; ) and transferred our interest in the Silver District Claims to Gulf + Western.

In November 2015 we were granted a new Arizona State Exploration Permit that effectively increases the size of our exploration permit in the Silver District from 154.66 acres to 334.85 acres.

In October 2012 Magellan staked fifty (50) unpatented lode mining claims known as the &#8220; Sacramento Mountains Project &#8221; totaling approximately 1,000 acres on Federal (BLM) land. In 2015, we renewed 14 of these claims and let the balance of the claims lapse. The Project is located in the northwest corner of the 

Sacramento Mountains approximately 10 miles WNW of Needles, California. On February 12, 2016, the White House announced President Obama had designated three national monuments in southern California covering 1.8 million acres of federal lands. We believe our Sacramento claims are within borders of one of these new monuments. We are in the process of determining what effect this new designation may have on our Sacramento Mountains Project.

Our primary focus during the next twelve months will be to further explore, and, if warranted and feasible, conduct exploration drilling to further develop our Silver District and Sacramento Mountain Projects, subject to available funding. 

We have only had limited operations to date and rely upon the sale of our securities and borrowings from significant investors to fund our operations, as we have not generated any revenue.

Our principal executive offices are located at 2010A Harbison Drive # 312, Vacaville, CA 95687. Our telephone number is (707) 884-3766, and our Internet website is www.magellangoldcorp.com .

Conflicts of Interests 

Athena Silver Corporation is a company under common control. Mr. Power is our President and director and is also a director and CEO of Athena. Mr. Power and Mr. Gibbs are significant investors in both Magellan and Athena.

Silver Saddle Resources, LLC ( &#8220; Silver Saddle &#8221; ) is a private company under common control. Mr. Power and Mr. Gibbs are significant investors and managing members of Silver Saddle.

Magellan, Athena and Silver Saddle are exploration stage companies and each is involved in the business of acquisition and exploration of mineral resources.

The existence of common ownership and common management could result in significantly different operating results or financial position from those that could have resulted had Magellan, Athena and Silver Saddle been autonomous. &#160; In addition, the common ownership could result in significant conflicts of interest both in terms of the allocation of working capital as well as under the doctrine of corporate opportunity, inasmuch as all three entities are engaged in mineral exploration in the United States. Messrs. Power and Gibbs have not adopted any policy or guidelines to mitigate the potential adverse effects of their conflicting interests between and among, Magellan, Athena and Silver Saddle.

Investors in Magellan should be cognizant that the interests of Magellan may, in the future, be in conflict with the other activities of Magellan &#8217; s control persons.

Our Properties 

Our primary focus during the next twelve months, and depending on available resources, will be to acquire, explore, and if warranted and feasible, permit and develop our mineral properties.

We have two material mineral properties that we currently intend to engage in exploration activities and, if commercially recoverable deposits are found, mineral development activities. To date, we have only begun preliminary exploration work. 

The following map illustrates the location of our significant properties in the States of Arizona and California:

SILVER DISTRICT, LA PAZ COUNTY, ARIZONA 

Effective August 28, 2012, Magellan entered into an Option Agreement with Columbus Silver (US) Corporation, a Nevada corporation ( &#8220; Columbus &#8221; ), which Option Agreement granted the Company the right to acquire all of Columbus &#8217; interest in its Silver District properties located in La Paz County, Arizona. Magellan paid Columbus an initial $63,200 on signing the Option and an additional $50,000 before December 31, 2012. An amendment was signed in August 2013 extending the payments to exercise the option. 

During February 2014 and January 2013, we paid the final two payments of $80,000 and $30,000, respectively, towards the purchase of the James Blaine-patented claim purchase obligation entered into between Columbus and a third party. We also paid all of the costs to maintain all of the claims and leases in 2013, 2014 and 2015. 

Effective September 29, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Columbus to purchase the patented and unpatented mining claims that had been covered by the Option Agreement. The Purchase Agreement superseded the Option Agreement and conveyed the Silver District Claims to the Company. In consideration of the Silver District Claims, we made a one-time payment to Columbus in the amount of $100,000. Following our purchase of the Silver District Claims, we formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary &#8220; Gulf + Western Industries, Inc. &#8221; ( &#8220; Gulf + Western &#8221; ) and transferred our interest in the Silver District Claims to Gulf + Western.

The Silver District project area consists of 87 unpatented lode mining claims, 6 patented lode claims, an Arizona State Exploration Permit of 334.85 acres and 23 unpatented mill site claims, totaling over 2,000 acres. The project is located approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Yuma in southwest Arizona. 

2014 Drilling Program 

In May 2014, we completed the drilling of three holes at our Silver District Project. The three holes were the initial holes of a permitted 12-hole exploratory program on Magellan &#8217; s unpatented claims near the Papago and Red Cloud Mines. The drilling program was permitted and bonded with the BLM and State of Arizona. Following the drilling program, our bond with the BLM in the amount of $21,457 was refunded.

Two of the three holes drilled (core holes PA-01 / 336 total depth &#38; PA-02 / 380 total depth) were designed to test the Papago target, and one hole (RC-01/ 244 total depth) was directed at the Red Cloud target. Our consulting geologist selected 52 samples that were delivered to ALS Labs in Reno, NV for analysis. 

The highlights of the assay results include the following:

&#183;

Excellent comparison of our core hole PA-01 with historic RC hole S242P. Magellan PA-01 intercept of 90 feet grading 6.05 OPT Ag, (including 10 feet of 17.06 OPT Ag), compared very favorably with the historic result of 90 feet grading 5.78 OPT Ag (including 10 feet averaging 14.60 OPT Ag).

&#183;

Previously unreported significant zinc and lead assays from the mineralization in PA-01 4.71% Zn and 1.56% Pb over 90 feet, including 10 feet averaging 8.35% Zn and 4.02% Pb. 

&#183;

PA-01 intercepted a previously unknown vein structure, about 15 feet wide and approximately 50 feet below the known mineralized structure, that includes 3 feet grading 3.64% Zn, 0.62% Pb and 0.15 OPT Ag. The significance of this occurrence relative to the Papago resource area is unknown.

&#183;

PA-02 was drilled 250 feet east of PA-01 to test for the down plunge extension of that intercept, but did not encounter any mineralization due to offset by a late fault.

&#183;

RC-01 was drilled just north of the Red Cloud open pit to intersect the extension of the Red Cloud vein beneath the Red Cloud Fault. Although the vein was known to be partly cut off by that fault, the hole intersected over 10 feet of the footwall of the vein, which has never been mined, including five feet grading 3.2% Pb, 7.47% Zn, 0.6 OPT Ag and Trace Au. The granodiorite in the footwall of the vein was extensively altered with stockwork veins for over 50 feet, containing anomalous levels of Pb, Zn, Ag and Au. 

The 2014 drill results will be incorporated into the existing historic drill database for use in planning additional drilling. Geologic evaluation of the entire district continues as Magellan develops additional drill targets in and around the multiple satellite deposits in the Silver District land package. 

2015 Sampling Program 

In 2015 the Company carried out a program of rock chip surface sampling. The samples were collected across seven of fourteen known deposits. Results were successful in validating the occurrence of silver values up to 13.0 ounces per ton and fluorspar values up to 25.7% over significant widths. Silver District deposits are localized along three major vein systems having a collective strike length of eight miles. Previous shallow drilling that partially tested these vein systems identified mineralized material containing silver and fluorite, with additional barite and lead-zinc mineralization. 

The sample results are consistent with historical drilling results. In addition, with respect to any future mining development, ICP 33-element analysis returned low values for environmentally undesirable elements such as mercury, arsenic and uranium.

Following are highlights of sample results:

Clip (15 ft rock chip across vein): 

13.0 opt Ag; 5.2% Fluorspar (CaF 2 ); 

6.9% Barite (BaSO 4 )

Geronimo (12 ft rock chip across vein): 

10.5 opt Ag; 5.7% Fluorspar; 1.5% Pb

MP (20 ft rock chip across vein): 

5.3 opt Ag

Red Cloud (30 ft rock chip across vein): 

4.1 opt Ag; 25.7% Fluorspar; 2.1% Zn

Pacific (20 ft rock chip across vein): 

1.0 opt Ag; 20.9% Fluorspar; 2.2% Pb; 

3.8%Zn

For locations of the deposits from which the samples were collected, refer to Magellan &#8217; s management presentation available on the Company &#8217; s website, www.magellangoldcorp.com. 

Geochemical analyses were performed by ALS Minerals in Reno, NV and Vancouver, B.C. Silver analysis was by four acid digestion, HCl leach and atomic absorption finish. Fluorine analysis was by Na 2 O 2 fusion, citric acid leach and ion selective electrode. Barium analysis was by fusion XRF. Lead and zinc analyses were by four acid digestion with ICP-AES finish. All samples were analyzed as part of a 33 element package by four acid digestion and ICP-AES finish. Gold analysis was by fire assay with atomic absorption finish.

SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS PROJECT 

The Sacramento Mountains Project is located approximately 10 miles west-northwest of Needles, California in the northwest corner of the Sacramento Mountains. In October 2012 Magellan staked fifty unpatented lode mining claims (SMF 1-50) on Federal (BLM) land. 

In August 2015 we renewed fourteen core claims with the BLM and let the remaining claims lapse. The claims we retained are listed as follows:

SMF 18 &#8211; 21 

&#160;

This property is without known reserves and our proposed program is exploratory in nature.

In 2013 Magellan permitted an exploratory drill program of up to six drill holes with the BLM, and submitted a bond in the amount of $8,639. The permit was good for two years from February 2013 but has been extended until February 2017.

On February 12, 2016, the White House announced President Obama had designated three national monuments in southern California covering 1.8 million acres of federal lands. We believe our Sacramento claims are within the borders of one of these new monuments. We are in the process of determining what effect this new designation may have on our Sacramento Mountains Project.

Discontinued Mineral Interests 

Pony Express Claims 

On November 18, 2010, we staked two unpatented lode mining claims (the &#8220; Pony Express Claims &#8221; ) giving us the right to explore, develop and conduct mining operations on these claims located in Churchill County, Nevada. We did not renew these claims in 2014.

Unpatented Mining Claims: The Mining Law of 1872 

Except for the Arizona State Mineral Lease and patented claims held within the Silver District Claims, our mineral rights consist of leases covering &#34;unpatented&#34; mining claims created and maintained in accordance with the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872, or the &#8220; General Mining Law. &#8221; Unpatented mining claims are unique U.S. property interests, and are generally considered to be subject to greater title risk than other real property interests because the validity of unpatented mining claims is often uncertain. The validity of an unpatented mining claim, in terms of both its location and its maintenance, is dependent on strict compliance with a complex body of federal and state statutory and decisional law that supplement the General Mining Law. Also, unpatented mining claims and related rights, including rights to use the surface, are subject to possible challenges by third parties or contests by the federal government. In addition, there are few public records that definitively control the issues of validity and ownership of unpatented mining claims. We have not filed a patent application for any of our unpatented mining claims that are located on federal public lands in the United States and, under possible future legislation to change the General Mining Law, patents may be difficult to obtain.

Our exploration, development and mining rights relate to patented and unpatented mining claims covering federal and State lands in Arizona and California. Most of our patented and unpatented claims are located in the Silver District in Arizona. 

Location of mining claims under the General Mining Law, is a self-initiation system under which a person physically stakes an unpatented mining claim on public land that is open to location, posts a location notice and monuments the boundaries of the claim in compliance with federal laws and regulations and with state location laws, and files notice of that location in the county records and with the Bureau of Land Management ( &#8220; BLM &#8221; ). Mining claims can be located on land as to which the surface was patented into private ownership under the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916, 43 U.S.C. &#167;299, but the mining claimant cannot injure, damage or destroy the surface owner's permanent improvements and must pay for damage to crops caused by prospecting. Discovery of a valuable mineral deposit, as defined under federal law, is essential to the validity of an unpatented mining claim and is required on each mining claim individually. The location is made as a lode claim for mineral deposits found as veins or rock in place, or as a placer claim for other deposits. While the maximum size and shape of lode claims and placer claims are established by statute, there are no limits on the number of claims one person may locate or own. The General Mining Law also contains provision for acquiring five-acre claims of non-mineral land for mill site purposes. A mining operation typically is comprised of many mining claims.

The holder of a valid unpatented mining claim has possessory title to the land covered thereby, which gives the claimant exclusive possession of the surface for mining purposes and the right to mine and remove minerals from the claim. Legal title to land encompassed by an unpatented mining claim remains in the United States, and the government can contest the validity of a mining claim. The General Mining Law requires the performance of annual assessment work for each claim, and subsequent to enactment of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. &#167;1201 et seq. , mining claims are invalidated if evidence of assessment work is not timely filed with BLM. However, in 1993 Congress enacted a provision requiring payment of $140 per year (now $155 per year) claim maintenance fee in lieu of performing assessment work, subject to an exception for small miners having less than 10 claims. No royalty is paid to the United States with respect to minerals mined and sold from a mining claim. In addition, in Nevada, holders of unpatented mining claims are required to pay the county recorder of the county in which the claim is situated an annual fee of $10.50 per claim.

The General Mining Law provides a procedure for a qualified claimant to obtain a mineral patent ( i.e., fee simple title to the mining claim) under certain conditions. It has become much more difficult in recent years to obtain a patent. Beginning in 1994, Congress imposed a funding moratorium on the processing of mineral patent applications which had not reached a designated stage in the patent process at the time the moratorium went into effect. Additionally, Congress has considered several bills in recent years to repeal the General Mining Law or to amend it to provide for the payment of royalties to the United States and to eliminate or substantially limit the patent provisions of the law.

Mining claims are conveyed by deed, or leased by the claimant to the party seeking to develop the property. Such a deed or lease (or memorandum of it) needs to be recorded in the real property records of the county where the property is located, and evidence of such transfer needs to be filed with BLM. It is not unusual for the grantor or lessor to reserve a royalty, which as to precious metals often is expressed as a percentage of net smelter returns.

Patented Mining Claims 

Patented mining claims, such as the ones located in our Silver District Project, are mining claims on federal lands that are held in fee simple by the owner. No maintenance fees or royalties are payable to the BLM; however lease payments and royalties with third parties are applicable on some of these claims.

LOCATION, HISTORY AND GEOLOGY OF OUR PROPERTIES 

SILVER DISTRICT 

The property covers the heart of the historic Silver District in La Paz County, approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Yuma in southwest Arizona. 

This property is currently without known reserves and our proposed program is exploratory in nature.

Location, Access and Composition 

The Silver District is located approximately 50 miles by road north of Yuma, Arizona on the southeast flank of the Trigo Mountains. Access to the property via a 4WD vehicle from Yuma is seasonally good, with 34 miles of paved or well-maintained gravel road and another 14 miles of seasonally maintained unimproved roads to the Red Cloud Mine, in the southwestern corner of the district. 

The Silver District Project consists of 87 unpatented lode mining claims, 6 patented lode claims, an Arizona State Exploration Permit of 334.85 acres and 23 unpatented mill site claims, totaling over 2,000 acres in La Paz County, Arizona. 

Certain of the underlying claims are subject to third party lease and or purchase obligations and net smelter royalties of varying percentages.

History 

The Silver District was discovered in 1862 and supported small but significant silver-lead production, largely from underground operations at the Red Cloud and Clip (Blaine patented claim) mines, during the ten year period from 1883 to 1893. Recorded production is estimated at 1.56 million ounces silver and 2.33 million pounds lead. There have been occasional small scale development activities since that time and in recent years the area has been a site for collection of high value, specimen wulfenite crystals.

Modern exploration, principally shallow drilling, metallurgical test work and a number of scoping studies to evaluate development of the silver and fluorspar deposits, was carried out intermittently from 1973 through 1992, initially by Gulf + Western Industries (no relation to our recently-formed subsidiary) through its New Jersey Zinc subsidiary, and followed by Orbex Resources and its successor companies, Silver Glance Resources and Silverspar Minerals. A total of 465 holes for an aggregate length of 62,866 feet were drilled during this period. The project has been largely inactive since the early 1990 &#8217; s.

Columbus Silver (US) Corporation acquired the project in 2004 and focused its efforts on re-consolidation of the property position, organization and compilation of technical records and limited field mapping and sampling.

Power and Water 

There are no modern mine developments or equipment on the property. The Red Cloud Mine patented mining claim has a covered shop and full time watchman with living facilities. It also has a water well and a small diesel generator. There is no commercial water or power available at the site and these would have to be developed with any mining development.

Geology 

The Silver District deposits consist of variable silver and lead-zinc mineralization in massive quartz-calcite-fluorspar-barite veins and breccia zones that occur within three major north-northwest trending vein systems having a collective strike length of about eight miles. The veins cut Tertiary volcanic and volcaniclastic rock formations, which overly an older, possibly Pre-Cambrian crystalline to metamorphic basement complex. Potential ore-grade silver (lead-zinc), fluorspar and barite deposits occur as pod-like bodies within all three vein systems. Various historic resource estimates, all pre-dating NI 43-101 reporting standards, have been carried out by past operators in the District.

EXPLORATION PLANS 

Subject to available funding, the following outlines our exploration plans for the Silver District.

Past explorers identified a number of outcropping ore bodies (some of which saw production in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries) and with shallow drilling defined new and larger deposits to open-pit depths. These known occurrences are the exposed portions of three long, through-going district wide fault trends. Potential for the discovery of additional mineralization is excellent at depth below known ore bodies and along the fault trends between known ore bodies. The best method for making new discoveries is by drilling at depth below known ore bodies. Geology and geophysics could prove useful in defining blind targets in non-outcropping areas. We chose he known mineralization at the historic Red Cloud and Papago mines as our initial exploration targets in the exploration drilling carried out in 2014.

Geological mapping, with rock sampling and assaying, will help guide drilling and geophysical surveying over the next twelve months. Geophysical test surveys to detect sulfide mineralization below known resources at Red Cloud and Papago, if successful, will be used to delineate drill targets under other historic resources and along the unexplored sections of the major mineralized structures. 

Subject to securing the necessary funding, we have budgeted $500,000 for exploration work over the next 12 to 24 months, comprising $100,000 for geology, geochemistry and computer modeling, $50,000 for geophysical orientation surveys, and $350,000 for diamond drilling and assaying of approximately 6,000 feet of core. 

We anticipate the exploration program will be supervised by Douglas R Bowden, a consulting geologist based in Sparks, Nevada. Mr. Bowden has over 35 years of experience in mining exploration in the United States, Canada and Mexico and is a licensed geologist in the State of Utah.

SACRAMENTO MOUNTAINS PROJECT 

This property is currently without known reserves and our proposed program is exploratory in nature.

Location, Access and Composition 

The Sacramento Mountains Project is located in the northwest corner of the Sacramento Mountains, approximately 10 miles west-northwest of Needles, San Bernardino County, California.. The northern end of the Project is near I-40, and existing utility service roads and 4WD roads provide access to the project area.

Magellan controls 100% unencumbered interest in fourteen unpatented lode mining claims on federal land, totaling approximately 280 acres. Originally, in 2012 we staked fifty claims but in August 2015 renewed only fourteen core claims with the BLM while allowing the remainder of the claims to lapse. The claims were properly recorded in San Bernardino County and with the Bureau of Land Management. The claims will remain in good standing until September 1, 2016, at which time annual renewal maintenance fees of $155 per claim (total $2,170) become due. 

On February 12, 2016, the White House announced President Obama had designated three national monuments in southern California covering 1.8 million acres of federal lands. We believe our Sacramento claims are within borders of one of these new monuments. We are in the process of determining what effect this new designation may have on our Sacramento Mountains Project.

Power and Water 

Commercial power is available along I- 40. The availability of water is unknown.

Geology 

The Project area is underlain by a sequence of Mid-Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rocks series that unconformably overlie a much older, possibly Pre-Cambrian metamorphic and crystalline complex that also forms the central core of the Sacramento Mountains. The entire sequence has been eroded and much of the area on the flanks of the mountains is covered by a gravel pediment or active gravel washes. A number of epithermal veins of quartz-calcite-barite composition cut the volcanic and sedimentary rocks and have historically been explored for copper, silver and gold. The veins occur as swarms within zones up to tens of feet wide and several hundred feet long. The veins dip moderately to steeply and strike in varying directions. There is some evidence in other parts of the Sacramento Mountains that the unconformity between the Tertiary and basement rocks may be mineralized, but the unconformity is not exposed on the Property and lies at an unknown depth below surface outcroppings of Tertiary rocks. Exploration targets include precious metal deposits in mineralized vein structures that continue to depth, and disseminated gold deposits associated with detachment faults along the projected underlying unconformity. 

History 

There are a number of historic pits, trenches, shafts and adits on outcroppings within the claim block that probably date to the 1890s, and some that may have been reopened in the 1920s. Modern exploration began in the 1980s by such mining companies as Duval, AMAX, Goldfields (London) and Fischer-Watt Mining. Further work was completed by Fischer-Watt in the 1990 &#8217; s. Exploration activities by these mining companies included surface mapping, geochemical sampling and limited programs of localized drilling near historic workings. Only limited anecdotal records of these activities exist in the Public Domain. 

Current State of Exploration 

All activities proposed are entirely exploratory in nature.

The claim group comprises an early stage exploration opportunity. Our exploration activity to date has been limited to land acquisition and preliminary field examination of old workings shown on USGS Quadrangle maps. AMAX reportedly drilled one RC hole near one of the historic workings within our t claim block that is reported to have encountered anomalous gold values. We intend to examine all outcroppings within the claim block and sample those that may be associated with mineralization. Our work may also include sampling and geochemical analysis of stream sediments, soils and vegetation. The workings that AMAX targeted with past drilling will be examined closely to determine whether core drilling would be warranted by the Company. The property has no known reserves. 

Silver-gold mineralization is contained in quartz-calcite veins that cut Tertiary volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks in the Sacramento Mountains. This epithermal system comprises numerous vein outcroppings throughout our claim block. The veins contain numerous historic prospects and small workings. The RC hole drilled by AMAX was in the northern part of the claim block and reportedly encountered anomalous gold values adjacent to exposed veining in outcrop. The vein has been intermittently traced for over 3000 feet along strike. Exploration of the exposed vein system and extensions under cover will initially entail core drilling to test down dip from mineralization exposed in the largest adit and to twin the AMAX RC hole. A geophysical survey of the immediate drill area may be useful in tracing the vein to depth and in 

testing a possible second target for mineralization at the intersection of the vein with the regional unconformity that exists between the Tertiary section and the underlying metamorphic basement. 

Subject to available funding, we have budgeted $130,000 for exploration work over the next 12 months, comprising $25,000 for geologic mapping and sampling, $15,000 for a geophysical orientation survey, and $90,000 for initial diamond drilling of two holes and assaying of 1,500 feet of core. 

We anticipate the exploration program will be supervised by Douglas R Bowden, a consulting geologist based in Sparks, Nevada. Mr. Bowden has over 35 years of experience in mining exploration in the United States, Canada and Mexico and is a licensed geologist in the State of Utah.

OUR EXPLORATION PROCESS 

Our exploration program is designed to acquire, explore and evaluate exploration properties in an economically efficient manner. We have not at this time identified or delineated any mineral reserves on any of our properties. 

Our current focus is primarily on the exploration of our Silver District (Arizona) and Sacramento Mountains Project. We plan to develop a formal sample collection and analysis process in due course; this process will include appropriate quality assurance and quality control procedures.

Subject to our ability to raise the necessary funds, we may acquire additional exploration properties near our existing properties or elsewhere and implement exploration programs that may cover these future properties.

We expect our exploration work on a given property to proceed generally in three phases. Decisions about proceeding to each successive phase will take into consideration the completion of the previous phases and our analysis of the results of those phases.

The first phase is intended to determine whether a prospect warrants further exploration and involves:

&#183;

researching the available geologic literature;

&#183;

interviewing geologists, mining engineers and others familiar with the prospect sites;

&#183;

conducting geologic mapping, geophysical testing and geochemical testing;

&#183;

examining any existing workings, such as trenches, prospect pits, shafts or tunnels;

&#183;

digging trenches that allow for an examination of surface vein structures as well as for efficient reclamation, re-contouring and re-seeding of disturbed areas; and,

&#183;

analyzing samples for minerals that are known to have occurred in the test area.

Subject to obtaining the necessary permits in a timely manner, the first phase can typically be completed on an individual property in several months at a cost of less than $200,000.

The second phase is intended to identify any mineral deposits of potential economic importance and would involve:

&#183;

examining underground characteristics of mineralization that were previously identified;

&#183;

conducting more detailed geologic mapping;

&#183;

conducting more advanced geochemical and geophysical surveys;

&#183;

conducting more extensive trenching; and

&#183;

conducting exploratory drilling.

Subject to obtaining the necessary permits in a timely manner, the second phase can typically be completed on an individual property in nine to twelve months at a cost of less than $1 million. Our Silver District Project has reached the second phase.

The third phase is intended to precisely define depth, width, length, tonnage and value per ton of any deposit that has been identified and would involve:

&#183;

drilling to develop the mining site;

&#183;

conducting metallurgical testing; and

&#183;

obtaining other pertinent technical information required to define an ore reserve and complete a feasibility study.

Depending upon the nature of the particular deposit, the third phase on any one property could take one to five years or more and cost well in excess of $1 million. None of our properties has reached the third phase. 

We intend to explore and develop our properties ourselves, although our plans could change depending on the terms and availability of financing and the terms or merits of any joint venture proposals.

PLAN OF EXPLORATION 

We intend to conduct further exploration on our Silver District (Arizona) and Sacramento Mountains Project (California) during 2016 in the manner previously described. Our 2016 plan of exploration is contingent upon securing additional loans or equity funding.

GOLD AND SILVER PRICES 

&#160;

Our operating results are substantially dependent upon the world market prices of gold and silver. We have no control over gold or silver prices, which can fluctuate widely. The volatility of such prices is illustrated by the following graphs, which respectively set forth the prices of gold and silver per ounce (as reported by www.kitco.com) during the periods indicated:

These historical prices are not indicative of future gold or silver prices. 

MARKETING 

&#160;

All of our mining operations, if successful, will produce precious metals in dor&#233; form or a concentrate that contains precious metals.

We plan to refine and market our precious metals dor&#233; and concentrates using a geographically diverse group of third party smelters and refiners. The loss of any one smelter or refiner may have a material adverse effect if alternate smelters and refiners are not available. We believe there is sufficient global capacity available to address the loss of any one smelter or refiner.

HEDGING ACTIVITES 

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to changes in gold and silver prices by selling precious metals production at market prices. We may sell precious metals from our future mines, if any, both pursuant to forward contracts and at spot prices prevailing at the time of sale. We may also enter into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for certain anticipated gold and silver production and to manage risks associated with commodities and foreign currencies.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

General 

Our activities are and will be subject to extensive federal, state and local laws governing the protection of the environment, prospecting, mine development, production, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such regulatory requirements are substantial and possible future legislation and regulations could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delays in the development and continued operation of our properties, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In the context of environmental permitting, including the approval of reclamation plans, we must comply with known standards and regulations which may entail significant costs and delays. Although we are committed to environmental responsibility and believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, amendments to current laws and regulations, more stringent implementation of these laws and regulations through judicial review or administrative action or the adoption of new laws could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations.

Federal Environmental Laws 

Certain mining wastes from extraction and beneficiation of ores are currently exempt from the extensive set of Environmental Protection Agency ( &#8220; EPA &#8221; ) regulations governing hazardous waste, although such wastes may be subject to regulation under state law as a solid or hazardous waste. The EPA has worked on a program to regulate these mining wastes pursuant to its solid waste management authority under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( &#8220; RCRA &#8221; ). Certain ore processing and other wastes are currently regulated as hazardous wastes by the EPA under RCRA. If our future mine wastes, if any, were treated as hazardous waste or such wastes resulted in operations being designated as a &#8220; Superfund &#8221; site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( &#8220; CERCLA &#8221; or &#8220; Superfund &#8221; ) for cleanup, material expenditures would be required for the construction of additional waste disposal facilities or for other remediation expenditures. Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or an owner or operator at the time of its contamination generally may be held liable and may be forced to undertake remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government &#8217; s cleanup efforts. Such owner or operator may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements may also be imposed upon our future tailings and waste disposal, if any, in Nevada under the Federal Clean Water Act ( &#8220; CWA &#8221; ) and state law counterparts. We have reviewed and considered current federal legislation relating to climate change and we do not believe it to have a material effect on our operations. Additional regulation or requirements under any of these laws and regulations could have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations.

EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS 

We have only one part-time employee, Mr. Power, who devotes approximately 25% of his time and attention to our business. We have agreed to pay Mr. Power $2,500 per month for his services.

We rely heavily on the services of our consulting geologist and other technical consultants.
