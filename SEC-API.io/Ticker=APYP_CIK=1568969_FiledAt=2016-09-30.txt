&#160;

Our Products, Markets and Customers 

&#160;

Our company&#8217;s primary products are mobile applications. Our company develops internal mobile applications and also acquires existing profitable mobile applications (&#8220;apps&#8221;), in order to build a diverse portfolio of apps that will service a wide range of industries and consumers. Our company plans to acquire apps that are currently in development, as well as apps that are ready to be presented to the public. By purchasing existing small but profitable application development companies, we aim to considerably cut the time to the market for introducing apps, which based on our company&#8217;s experience, is approximately six months. Our company intends to market and sell our developed and acquired apps under our own name. Our company&#8217;s target customers vary widely, due to the numerous types of apps that are currently available. Below, our current business strategy and plan are detailed in an effort to explain the methods by which our company generates revenue. Our company does not currently have any proposals or arrangements to enter into any business acquisitions or other business combinations.

&#160;

Source Code Assets 

&#160;

On February 1, 2013, we acquired a portfolio of 13 iOS kid friendly gaming mobile applications on the iOS platform. The game titles include SkyRaiders, DartWheel for iPhone &#38; iPad, VultureHunt, PumpkinNinja, TinyCrusaders, TinyScots, TinyJones, TinyKnights, CowboyClimb, Stacker, Snap &#38; DoodleFreak.

&#160;

On April 2, 2013 we acquired a mobile application that will help the millions of amusement and theme park visitors by providing them with accurate attraction wait times, ride information, theme park maps, hours of park operation, parade and show times, firework times, and much more in the palms of millions of iPhone users' hands. Currently, these features are available for Disney World's Magic Kingdom &#210; , Epcot &#210; , Disney's Hollywood Studios &#210; , and Disney's Animal Kingdom &#210; .

&#160;

On October 15, 2014, we acquired an automobile and the MySocial mobile application for $60,000. The purchase was satisfied through the issuance of a Promissory Note in an amount of $60,000. The MySocial mobile application is a social media application that allows a user to share news, videos, and other information to various social media outlets.

&#160;

We plan on expanding our portfolio of apps, both in terms of the number of apps it owns, as well as the categories and industries in which those apps function.

&#160;

Current Products 

&#160;

Currently our company has 14 fully developed theme park wait time applications operating on two platforms in five different languages. In addition, we have 13 fully developed gaming applications. The fully developed theme park and gaming applications are currently being offered by our company. We have also acquired 23 separate source code applications that are classified into the following categories: games, business, education, entertainment, finance, lifestyle, medical, music, navigation, news, travel, utilities, and wellness. We are currently finishing the development of our source code applications, and plan to offer the applications for sale once they have been fully developed.

&#160;

Our company currently generates nominal revenues from paid downloads and advertisement integration. We currently use advertising integration in the free versions of our mobile applications that are downloaded by consumers. Advertisement integration has accounted for roughly five percent of our total revenues as of the date of this annual report. Our company plans to continue using advertisement integration in the free versions of our mobile apps. However, at the time of the initial download, or at any time after the initial download of our application, the consumer can choose to pay for the full application, at which time the advertisements are removed. Our company plans on generating future revenues from the purchase of underdeveloped mobile applications, application development and mobile application development consulting. There is currently no single customer or product that has accounted for a material portion of our revenues.

Management and Development Role 

&#160;

We intend to become a management company that supervises and directs the application development work, while focusing our efforts on the promotion, marketing, and sales of its acquired apps. We intend to obtain the services of specialized app marketing companies in order to become well positioned in online mobile app stores. In addition, our company believes that by properly marketing our apps, we will be able to increase downloads, lower the acquisition costs associated with the acquired apps, and expand our portfolio of apps for all current and future platforms. To date, our company has been selling our apps through online mobile application stores. Our company intends to hire third party marketing companies, which will advertise for our company on websites, search engines and other mobile applications, in order to increase our potential customer base, which our company believes will increase our application downloads and purchases.

&#160;

Needs Assessment 

&#160;

Management believes the principal growth area in the personal computer market today is that of Smartphones and portable tablet devices; aside from being a large and quickly growing market, these mobile devices usually allow full time internet connectivity. At this time, our company believes that by marketing our current app portfolio, and also expanding our portfolio, our company will be able to provide a wide range of apps to many different types of potential purchasers.

&#160;

Revenue Model and Distribution methods of the products or services 

&#160;

Our revenue model is based on the continued development and acquisition of our apps, as well as the sale of such apps. We either develop apps internally, or acquire third party apps or app developing companies, and then resell those apps to our customers through mobile app stores. The apps must meet our stringent criteria, and we plan on only developing and acquiring apps that fit categories and platforms that already have a strong customer base. Our company does not currently have any proposals or arrangements to enter into any business acquisitions or other business combinations

&#160;

We are redefining the current app development industry by not only developing and marketing our own apps, but also acquiring third party apps and app development companies. 

&#160;

Our company generates revenue through the sale of the apps, which we either develop internally, or acquire from outside sources. Such apps are then sold in mobile app stores. The cost of developing a wide variety of apps is prohibitive for a majority of companies.

&#160;

Our company will identify and address additional target categories and industries for its products based on market research and feedback from our customers.

&#160;

Status of any publicly announced new product or service 

&#160;

None

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

We do not have a seasonal business cycle.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The app development market is very competitive, with many companies developing apps worldwide. Also, it is possible that our business model may be duplicated in the future. However, at the current time we believe our system and business method of not only generating internal apps, but also continuously acquiring third party apps and app development companies will give us access to a large number of mobile apps, and while that will not decrease the amount of competitors in the industry, it will place us in a very competitive position, as we will have apps that function in a wide range of categories. Our ability to sell apps that operate in a wide range of categories will allow us to reach a large customer base, consisting of consumers who will purchase our mobile applications on app stores, which we believe will allow us to be successful and competitive, regardless of the number of other application development companies that compete in our industry. Rather than targeting small amounts of consumers with a limited number of apps, we believe that our wide range of products will allow us to sell our products to consumers with varying interests from multiple demographics.

&#160;

Platform 

&#160;

Mobile app development companies other than ours do exist. However, our business strategy and revenue generation model will allow us to obtain a large amount of apps in all categories that perform on all platforms, which will separate us from our competitors, due to the large number of potential customers we will be able to target based on our wide range of apps. Another important difference between us and our competitors, is that we will not only be creating and developing our own internal apps, but also will be acquiring existing apps that will be added to our app portfolio. We believe that by developing and acquiring a large number of apps, we will be able to sell our products to a large potential customer based covering many demographics.

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

Structured as a mobile app development, acquisition and management company, our business model is designed to provide an almost unlimited amount of apps that can be of use to a large amount of different consumer purchasers. We will sell our products to consumers in mobile application stores, and we will also hire third party marketing companies in order to reach a large number of potential consumer purchasers of our apps.

&#160;

Compliance Approval 

&#160;

Our company does not require any government approval for our services. As a mobile application product provider, our business will not be subject to any environmental laws.

&#160;

Compliance with Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our company will be subject to local and international laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to our operations. We will also be subject to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of our business. Our company believes that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities of our management to ensure that our company is in compliance with securities regulations as they apply to our company&#8217;s products as well as ensuring that our company does not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect to our products. Our company will also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain complaint with securities regulations as well as any corporate tax liability we incur.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We have incurred $Nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our company currently has no patents or trademarks on our brand name and we have not and do not intend to seek protection for our brand name or our mobile applications at this time; however, as business develops and operations continue, it may seek such protection. Despite efforts to protect our proprietary rights, such as our brand and service names, since we have no patent or trademark rights unauthorized persons may attempt to copy aspects of our company business, including our web site design, services, product information and sales mechanics or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Any encroachment upon our company&#8217;s proprietary information, including the unauthorized use of our brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated against us for infringement upon another company's proprietary information or improper use of their trademark, may affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on our business. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets and domain name and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation or adverse proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of operations.

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160;

Our company does not currently have any licenses to use any third-party intellectual property, but is in the process of acquiring all necessary licensing rights to use all necessary third-party intellectual property. Our company is currently working with intellectual property counsel to obtain such licenses, and is currently in negotiations, through our intellectual property counsel, with third party intellectual property owners to obtain such licenses through licensing agreements. Our company will execute any necessary licensing agreements in order to use any trademarked third party intellectual property. Our company may be unsuccessful in obtaining such licenses, which could affect our ability to continue operations, and could also result in lawsuits related to intellectual property infringement.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, we have no employees other than our officers and directors.
