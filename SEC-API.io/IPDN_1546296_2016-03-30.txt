 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

The Company is a dynamic operator of professional networks with a focus on diversity. We use the term &#8220;diversity&#8221; (or &#8220;diverse&#8221;) to describe communities, or &#8220;affinities,&#8221; that are distinct based on a wide array of criteria which may change from time to time, including ethnic, national, cultural, racial, religious or gender classification. We serve a variety of such communities, including Women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Disabled, Military Professionals, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT). Our goal is (i) to assist our registered users and members in their efforts to connect with like-minded individuals, identify career opportunities within the network and (ii) connect members with prospective employers while helping the employers address their workforce diversity needs. We believe that the combination of our solutions allows us to approach recruiting and professional networking in a unique way and thus create enhanced value for our members and clients.

Industry Overview 

&#160;

Ninety-four companies in the Fortune 100 feature diversity hiring on their online career centers. The online diversity recruitment market is highly fragmented and is characterized by the following trends: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Acceptance and Growth of Online Recruitment and Advertisement . Businesses now recognize and strive to take advantage of the socialization of the Internet for recruitment and for brand management, marketing and advertising. Results of the Jobvite Recruiter Nation Survey 2015, Jobvite, Inc., an online professional network, indicate that 92% of recruiters use online social networking tools for recruitment and 56% have successfully hired through an online social networking website. The market for advertising on online social networks in the United States is also expected to continue to grow rapidly. According to Statista Inc., a leading online statistics company, the advertising revenue of social networks worldwide amounted to $25.1 billion in 2015 and is projected to grow to $41 billion by 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Regulatory Environment Favorable to Promoting Diversity in the Workplace . In August 2011, President Obama signed Executive Order 13583 to establish a coordinated government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce. This Executive Order requires companies considering contracting with the federal government to be prepared to demonstrate the diversity of their workforce. Certain companies that have federal contracts are subject to this Executive Order. In the public sector, the Dodd&#8211;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220; Dodd-Frank Act &#8221;) mandated that each of the eight U.S. financial agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and twelve Federal Reserve banks create Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion (&#8220; OMWI &#8221;) to be responsible for all agency matters relating to diversity in management, employment and business activities. The OMWI monitor diversity within their ranks as well as within the pool of contractors who provide goods and services to the government. Previously, the Federal Reserve system and some of the agencies were essentially exempt from contract diversity efforts. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Growing Ethnic Diversity of the U.S. Population and Labor Force . Multicultural groups are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. Hispanics, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and all other multiculturals &#160; were estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to make up 38% of the U.S. population in 2014, with census projections showing that multicultural populations will become a numeric majority by 2044. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2014 National Projections, multicultural population is expected to increase 95% between 2014 and 2060. In sheer numbers, Hispanic-Americans are expected to experience the most growth among diversity groups, growing from 17% of the total population in 2014 to 29% by 2060. African-American population is expected to increase from 14% in 2014 to 18% in 2060, and Asian-American population from 6% in 2014 to 12% in 2060. Not surprisingly, diversity recruitment is increasingly becoming a common, if not standard, business practice by major employers. According to the Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, of the 2015 annual average of approximately 149 million employees nationwide, approximately 47% were women and approximately 34% were Hispanic, African American or Asian American. According to a job report on private sector hiring published by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in July 2015, the percentage of minority employment in the U.S. compared to overall employment grew from 11% in 1966 to 37% in 2014. In the U.S., Hispanic-Americans had the fastest growth rate in the U.S. private sector, with employment of Hispanic-Americans increasing from 2.5% to 13.9% between 1966 and 2013. The share of the labor force that is Hispanic-American is projected to increase from 16.3% in 2014 to 19.8% in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Demographic Trend Toward Women&#8217;s Career Advancement . According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over 74 million women 16 years old and over in the workforce as of January 2016. The number of women in the labor force is expected to increase to 77.2 million by 2024. In 2015, women accounted for 52% of all workers employed in management, professional, and related occupations. According to the Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2015 women also made up the majority of healthcare support occupations (87.6%) and healthcare practitioners and technical occupations (75.1%), the occupations expected to grow most rapidly between 2014 and 2024. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Rising Spending Power of Diverse Population . According to Nielsen N.V., a global consumer research company, U.S. multicultural buying power is growing at an exponential rate versus total U.S. consumers, increasing from $661 billion in 1990 to $3.4 trillion in 2014. This represents a percentage increase of 415%, which more than doubled the total U.S. buying power increase of 204%. The spending power of diverse groups is expected to continue to grow in the U.S., with the Hispanic market being the fastest growing according to the 2014 Multicultural Economy Report from the Selig Center for Economic Growth at The University of Georgia Terry College of Business (the &#8220; Selig Center &#8221;). The Selig Center estimates that by 2019 Hispanics will account for 10.6% of total U.S. buying power. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Increasing Socialization of the Internet . The Internet has revolutionized how information is created and communicated - a wealth of information is readily accessible by browsing the Internet anonymously. However, we believe the social aspect of the Internet is emerging as an increasingly powerful influence on our lives. While an individual&#8217;s interpersonal connections traditionally have not been visible to others, social and professional networking websites enable members to share, and thereby unlock, the value of their connections by making them visible. Today, personal connections and other information, such as online social and professional networking websites, are increasingly becoming a powerful tool for a growing population of users to connect with one another. 

&#160;

Our Solutions 

&#160;

We operate in three business segments: (i) Professional Diversity Network (&#8220; PDN Network &#8221;), which includes online professional networking communities with career resources tailored to the needs of various diverse cultural groups, (ii) National Association of Professional Women (&#8220; NAPW Network &#8221;), a women-only professional networking organization, and (iii) Noble Voice operations (&#8220; Noble Voice &#8221;), a career consultation and lead generation service. In 2015, our PDN Network, NAPW Network and Noble Voice businesses represented 8.8%, 66.6% and 24.6% of our revenues, respectively. 

&#160;

For financial information about our operating segments please see Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. 

&#160;

PDN Network 

&#160;

Recruitment Solutions . The PDN Network consists of several online professional networking communities dedicated to serving diverse professionals in the United States and employers seeking to hire diverse talent. We use the word &#8220;professional&#8221; to describe any person interested in the Company&#8217;s websites presumably for the purpose of career advancement or related benefits offered by the Company, whether or not such person is employed and regardless of the level of education or skills possessed by such person. Our networking communities harness our relationship recruitment methodology to facilitate and empower professional networking within common affinities. We believe that those within a common affinity often are more aggressive in helping others within their affinity progress professionally. We operate these relationship recruitment affinity groups within the following sectors: Women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Disabled, Military Professionals, Lesbians, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT), and Students and Graduates seeking to transition from education to career. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 7,485,000 registered users. We use the term &#8220;registered user&#8221; to describe a consumer who has affirmatively visited one of our properties, opted into an affinity group and provided us with demographic or contact information enabling us to match them with employers and/or jobs. We expect that continued registered user growth of the PDN Network will enable us to further develop our list of online professional diversity networking and career placement solutions. We currently provide access to our PDN Network websites to registered users at no cost. We intend to introduce a premium paid membership across the PDN Network, similar to the premium paid membership currently offered by the NAPW Network. Merger with NAPW, Inc. in September 2014 (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;) allowed us to expand our talent pool by adding engaged professional women. The same Hire AdvantEdge product that creates value for members by matching them with employers in a high touch manner provides employers with a very desirable candidate in an efficient, resourced and qualified manner. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We offer to large and medium employers seeking to diversify their employment ranks, and to third party recruiters (i) real-time solutions that deliver diverse talent, (ii) advertising and promotion of their job opportunities to our networks of diverse professionals and (iii) assistance with posting their job opportunities to career agencies in a manner compliant with the regulations and requirements of the Equal Employment Opportunity Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program (&#8220; OFCCP &#8221;), including those of state and local governments. Our recruitment advertising solutions promote hiring and retention success by providing job seekers with information that we believe allows them to look beyond a corporate brand, deeper into employers&#8217; core values. We use sophisticated technology to deliver recruitment advertising using Internet banner ads and email marketing targeted by geography and occupation, based upon data from our audiences&#8217; profiles and job searches on our websites. As of December 31, 2015, we had over 440 companies utilizing our products and services. 

&#160;

Networking Events. In addition to online networking, our registered users can participate in a number of local and national events held across the United States, including monthly NAPW local chapter meetings, business expos, charitable events and other events developed specifically to facilitate face-to-face networking with other professionals. In 2015, we held over 20 Career Networking Conferences, including NAPW&#8217;s three-city National Networking Summit Series and two online career fairs for veterans and their spouses. We schedule NAPW Network events after PDN Career Networking Conferences in order to create opportunities for employers participating in the PDN Network events to receive exposure to more candidates. In addition, we derive new members for both our PDN Network affinities and NAPW Network membership roll from participation in the events, promote retention among paying NAPW Network members and derive goodwill and positive publicity for our corporate brands. 

&#160;

Hire AdvantEdge . In early 2015, we launched the new Hire AdvantEdge product which allows us to sell the qualified candidate lead referral to employers via an e-commerce model. Hire AdvantEdge is a data-driven product, which matches registered users with jobs offered by our employment partners, qualifies those registered users for our partners&#8217; jobs, secures an indication of interest, and directly provides our partner with the registered user&#8217;s information or submits an application on behalf of the registered user to our partner&#8217;s recruitment system. This allows us to deliver to recruiters qualified candidates in an efficient manner with very little lag in time. Hire AdvantEdge was made possible by the combination of Noble Voice&#8217;s current interaction with job seekers, its technology and Professional Diversity Network&#8217;s relationships with employers who desire to recruit qualified diverse talent. The PDN Network Hire AdvantEdge product delivers enhanced membership value to those registered users seeking to reenter the workforce or to upgrade their professional employment condition. This benefit comes at no additional cost to members, reinforcing the membership value proposition and creating long-term value. In 2016, we plan to enhance the Hire AdvantEdge product with a licensed recruitment platform, a cloud based software system that will access Hire AdvantEdge from our business partners&#8217; desktops. This Hire AdvantEdge license will enable recruiters to post jobs directly and to search the PDN Network database. They will also be able to enhance their recruitment opportunities with both an assessment and the ability to process applicants through their internal applicant tracking systems. 

&#160;

PDN(Hired). During 2015 we also launched our PDN(Hired) product, which uses matching and targeting technology to match members with our partners on a renewing license basis, designed to provide the Company with increasing residual income as we add new partners and sell additional licenses. Though in its early stages, the PDN(Hired) product is a significant step towards increasing online sales in a scalable and residual manner. 

&#160;

NAPW Network 

&#160;

The NAPW Network is a professional networking organization for women, with approximately 850,000 paid and unpaid members as of December 31, 2015. We use the term &#8220;member&#8221; to describe a consumer who has viewed our marketing material, opted into membership with the NAPW Network, provided demographic information and engaged in an onboarding call with a membership coordinator. We believe NAPW Network is the most prominent women-only professional networking organization in the United States. Members of the NAPW Network enjoy a wealth of resources dedicated to developing their professional networks, furthering their education and skills and promoting their businesses and career accomplishments. We acquired the NAPW Network in September 2014 through a merger of NAPW, Inc., a New York corporation (&#8220; Old NAPW &#8221;) with and into NAPW Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (the &#8220; Merger Sub &#8221;). Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, between the Merger Sub, the Old NAPW and Matthew B. Proman, the sole shareholder of Old NAPW, dated July 11, 2014 (the &#8220; M erger Agreement &#8221;), upon the closing of the Merger, the Old NAPW ceased to exist and the Merger Sub continued as the surviving corporation and was renamed &#8220;NAPW, Inc.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We provide NAPW Network members with opportunities to network and develop valuable business relationships with other professionals through NAPW&#8217;s website, as well as at events hosted at nearly 200 local chapters across the United States. PDN Network products and services are being deployed to provide enhanced value to the NAPW membership experience, which we believe will be an important component in increasing both the number of new memberships and renewals of existing memberships. 

&#160;

Professional Identity Management. Through the NAPW Network website, NAPW Network members are able to create, manage and share their professional identity online and promote themselves and their businesses. NAPW Network members can also promote their career achievements and their businesses through placement on the NAPW Network website&#8217;s home page, in proprietary press releases, in the online Member Marketplace and in monthly newsletter publications. In addition, the PDN Network provides members with direct access to employers seeking to hire professional women at a high level of connectivity and efficiency. The Merger has enabled us to match members with our employment partners and then converse with the member to confirm such member&#8217;s desire to take the position to which we matched them, confirm that member is qualified for the position and directly notify the employer about a member that we have qualified and confirmed has competed an application within the employer&#8217;s recruitment system. In addition to Hire AdvantEdge and PDN(Hired), PDN Network provides alternative values to NAPW Network members who are employed or are seeking employment, including, but not limited to, our patented resume optimizing service (Resunate), our semantic search job alerts and a new professional networking platform based upon PDN Network&#8217;s core networking technology. For those members who are self-employed, PDN Network has launched a &#8220;NAPW Certified Women-Owned Business&#8221; program that includes an online marketplace for companies to source services from an NAPW Certified Women-Owned Business. 

&#160;

Networking Events. Historically, NAPW Network&#8217;s offline networking opportunities included monthly local chapter events and a National Networking Conference NAPW sponsored. In 2015, we sponsored a three-city National Networking Summit Series, with events in Chicago and Los Angeles and a New York event. Additionally, the Company held more than 20 other professional networking events nationwide, in conjunction with PDN Network&#8217;s Career Networking Conferences. In the next few years, we expect to continue to leverage the existing PDN Network events platform to host NAPW networking events in major markets around the nation. Because PDN Network networking career events are already being conducted we have the ability to add an additional event for NAPW at the same venue, one hour after the PDN Network event ends, at a substantially lower cost compared to hosting a stand-alone NAPW event. Employers who sponsor the PDN Network career networking events will have the opportunity to participate in the NAPW event and meet with members to discuss employment opportunities in what we believe is an inviting and upscale networking environment. We believe that providing the opportunity for NAPW Registered Users to meet, outside of the monthly local chapter events and the single national event, will add value to all NAPW Registered Users through allowing them to attend any or all of our PDN Network events. Non-members may also attend, subject to certain restrictions. 

&#160;

Access to Knowledge. In addition to networking and promotional opportunities, NAPW Network also provides to its members the ability to further develop their skills and expand their knowledge base through monthly newsletters, online and in-person seminars, webinars and certification courses. 

&#160;

Upgraded Memberships and Ancillary Products . Upgraded packages include the VIP membership, which includes additional promotional and publicity tools as well as free access for the member and a guest to the National Networking Summits and continuing education programs; the press release package, which provides members with the opportunity to work with professional writers to publish personalized press releases and thereby secure valuable online presence; and the registry product, which allows members to create a durable, historical record chronicling their career achievements. 

&#160;

Partner Discounts . We also offer to NAPW Network members exclusive discounts on third-party products and services. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Noble Voice 

&#160;

The Noble Voice call centers qualify callers for real-time job placement. The Noble Voice division typically conducts over 25,000 career consultations per week. We monetize these consultations by using proprietary technology to drive inexpensive online traffic to our offline call centers and generating value-added leads, which we sell to strategic partners who provide continuing education and career services. Noble Voice maintains a sophisticated Customer Relations Management database and interface (&#8220; CRM &#8221;) and marketing controls, and is able to efficiently manage the number of consultations to match demand. We have leveraged Noble Voice&#8217;s technology to roll out our Hire AdvantEdge product and an upgraded CRM for use by the NAPW Network across all aspects of its operations. Noble Voice&#8217;s technology also allowed us to improve our methods of communication for lead-generation, deliver upgraded benefits to our NAPW Network members, PDN Network registered users and our clients through their client portal, launch NAPW Network&#8217;s new website, drive a significant increase in web traffic and time on site and greatly increase the rate of new user registrations on our online properties. 

&#160;

We acquired the assets that now constitute Noble Voice from Global Outreach Ventures, Inc. (&#8220; Global Outreach &#8221;), a career consultation company in November 2014. The acquired assets consisted of two subsidiaries, Noble Voice LLC and Compliant Lead LLC, which together employ approximately 200 full and part-time employees located in Darien, Illinois. As the result of the acquisition, Noble Voice LLC and Compliant Lead LLC became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, and the Company issued 300,000 shares to the owners of Global Outreach and paid a promissory note in the amount of $1,294,753 during the 12 months following acquisition based upon collected accounts receivable and assumed accounts payable included among these assets. 

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Customer Support 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We sell NAPW Network membership subscriptions offline through our NAPW Network sales force, which currently includes 57 sales professionals. We developed a secure, work-from-home technology along with a training and supervision platform aimed at reducing the overhead costs, increasing per-representative profitability, and offering our sales professionals flexible working arrangements. We currently have 10 sales representatives selling upgraded memberships and ancillary products. We believe that we maintained high visibility for the NAPW Network during 2015 through its 1.3 billion advertisements served online, in-person impressions through its live networking activities and interactions via its online properties and social media accounts. 

&#160;

Our sales resources for recruitment and recruitment advertising products and services include a sales force, third-party strategic partners who deliver employers with demand for our products, and technology, which facilitates e-commerce transactions. We market directly to employers and third-party recruiters. Our sales team uses a combination of telephone, email and face-to-face marketing, including personal visits to companies or their recruitment agencies, as well as appearances at industry and trade group events where diversity recruitment recruiters are in attendance. We have also formed strategic alliances with parties who are able to help extend our organic reach. In addition, we are developing purely online marketing channels to bring recruiters to us in bulk and use products based on a matching and targeting technology to facilitate sales. Our recruitment and recruitment advertising sales force is divided between three groups: (i) the &#8220;table-setters,&#8221; who are responsible for setting up first meetings with prospect companies, (ii) the career sales professionals, who conduct the first meeting and mature the conversation to a successful conclusion, and (iii) sales professionals who provide ongoing account management and are responsible for successful client renewals. We have specialty units within our sales force dedicated to serving: (i) federal, state and local governments and companies and contractors who serve these governmental entities, (ii) small and medium sized businesses as defined by companies with less than 2,500 employees and (iii) large enterprises with greater than 2,500 employees. 

&#160;

Customer Support, Compliance and Testing 

&#160;

In addition to our sales professionals, we also employ support teams to provide customer support, compliance and testing. Our customer support teams, located in our Garden City, NY and Darien, IL offices, work together to improve engagement with our members and to ensure a high degree of member satisfaction and retention. Our compliance team focuses on ensuring the integrity of the NAPW Network sales process. The team works closely with customer support and sales management to ensure that sales are conducted in an ethical manner and to identify sales representatives who would benefit from enhanced training. Our testing team consists of representatives who work with our Development and Executive teams to identify new lead-generation, sales and membership product opportunities, and to test those as well as new approaches to our current sales. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Strengths 

&#160;

We believe the following elements give us a competitive advantage to accomplish our mission: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Dedicated Focus on Diverse Professionals . Our focus on providing career opportunities for diverse professionals differentiates us from other online social networking websites, such as Facebook. We believe our websites have a distinctly career-oriented feel and utility when compared with other online social networking websites. We believe that users prefer to manage their professional and social identities and contacts separately. While other online professional networking websites, such as LinkedIn, also have a professional focus, we are singularly focused on diverse professionals in the United States. We believe that we communicate effectively with each of our diverse communities and create environments that harness a natural affinity among members of common culture, ethnicity, gender, orientation, nationality and experience to stimulate increased member trust, networking and engagement. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Platform That Harnesses the Power of Web Socialization . We believe that our membership base will continue to grow and that our platform will be an increasingly powerful tool that enables our members to leverage their connections and shared information for the collective benefit of all of the participants on our platform. We believe that we are the first online professional network to focus on the diversity recruitment sector. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Relationships with Strategic Partners . We believe that our relationships with strategic partners are difficult to replicate and give us a competitive advantage in the networking opportunities, career tools and resources we can offer to our members, as well as the diverse audiences we can access for employers and advertisers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Relationships with Professional Organizations . Our team has experience working with multicultural professional organizations. We partner with a number of leading minority professional organizations, including:

&#183; 

Customized Technology Platform . Our technology platform has been custom-designed and built to facilitate networking engagement, job searching, real-time job qualification and matching, and text-based communications. 

&#160;

We believe that the following elements give us a competitive advantage with respect to the NAPW Network: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Exclusive Focus on Professional Women . As a result of NAPW Network&#8217;s exclusive focus on professional women, we believe that through NAPW Network we provide a unique, secure and less intimidating environment within which our members can successfully network and establish new and lasting business relationships. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Attractive Industry Demographic Trends . Favorable demographic trends regarding women&#8217;s participation in the labor force will further the growth in NAPW Network&#8217;s membership base and we have first-mover advantage with respect to generalized professional networking for women. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Large, growing and diverse national membership base . We believe that NAPW Network is the largest women-only networking organization in the United States by number of members, with approximately 850,000 members located in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The membership base of the NAPW Network is diverse in terms of ethnicity, age, income, experience, industry and occupation. It includes members from small and large corporations, as well as entrepreneurs and business owners. We believe the diversity of the NAPW Network membership base is a key component of its value. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Comprehensive Product and Service Offerings to Deliver Value to Members . We believe that our comprehensive product offerings provide women valuable tools to help them advance their careers and expand their businesses. Through networking opportunities online and at local chapter events in their communities, regional events and the NAPW Network national Networking Conference, discounts provided on seminars, webinars and educational certification courses, and opportunities to promote themselves and their businesses, NAPW members are provided the opportunities and tools for their professional development. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

Business Model with Efficient Member Acquisition and Recurring Cash Flow . We believe that NAPW Network&#8217;s direct marketing lead generation efforts, which utilize both direct mail and digital strategies, are among the most efficient in the industry as measured by our internal response and click-through rates. This efficiency, combined with our effective call center operations, results in what we believe to be our market leading members acquisition process and direct variable contribution. Further, NAPW Network memberships renew annually, providing a valuable recurring stream of cash flow. 

&#160;

Strategic Alliances 

&#160;

We consider our partner alliances to be a key value to our clients because it enables us to expand our job distribution and outreach efforts. We continue to expand our relationships with key strategic partners that we believe are valuable to our core clients. We currently maintain relationships with the following key strategic partner organizations:

Operations 

&#160;

Our headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois, and houses our CEO and CFO, as well as many of our sales, marketing and IT personnel. We also have an office in Minnetonka, MN where our telesales team for our Events business is located. Websites for the PDN Network are hosted by Engine Yard based in San Francisco, California. Engine Yard provides a robust and easy platform for our hosting needs, allowing us to scale up resources to meet our peak needs. It also allows us to quickly and easily deploy website updates. Our websites have backup and contingency plans in place in the event that an unexpected circumstance occurs. 

&#160;

Membership service operations for the NAPW Network are located in Garden City, New York. NAPW Network&#8217;s publication operations are also based in Garden City, New York.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark rights to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks in the United States. Our registered trademarks in the United States include the &#8220;iHispano&#8221; mark with stylized logo, the &#8220;Black Career Network&#8221; mark with stylized logo, the &#8220;Professional Diversity Network&#8221; mark with our tagline &#8220;the power of millions for the benefit of one,&#8221; the name &#8220;National Association of Professional Women&#8221; and &#8220;NAPW,&#8221; and the taglines &#8220;Power to Be You,&#8221; and &#8220;Endless Opportunities,&#8221; as well as others. We also own the copyrights to certain articles in NAPW publications. We strive to exert control over access to our intellectual property and customized technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of our business. 

&#160;

Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be successful. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business or our ability to compete. In addition, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and adversely affect our operating results. 

&#160;

Other companies in the Internet, social media, technology and other industries own patents, copyrights and trademarks, and we expect that from time to time they may request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suits against us for alleged infringements or other violations of intellectual property rights. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, with respect to our members and our recruitment consumer advertising and marketing solutions, we compete with existing general market online professional networking websites, such as LinkedIn and Monster Worldwide, Inc., as well as ethnic minority focused social networking websites, such as Black Planet and MiGente, and other companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter that are developing or could develop competing solutions. We also generally compete with online and offline enterprises, including newspapers, television and direct mail marketers that generate revenue from recruiters, advertisers and marketers, and professional organizations. With respect to our hiring solutions, we also compete with traditional online recruiting companies such as Career Builder, talent management companies such as Taleo, and traditional recruiting firms. 

&#160;

Larger, more well-established companies may focus on professional networking and could directly compete with us. Other companies might also launch new competing services that we do not offer. Nevertheless, we believe that our focus on diverse online professional networking communities and the number of registered users or members, as the case may be, overall and within each affinity that we serve, are competitive strengths in our market. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to a number of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. These laws are still evolving and could be amended or interpreted in ways that could be detrimental to our business. In the United States and abroad, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the advertisements posted or the content provided by users. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users and other third parties could materially harm our business. In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct, such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information, money laundering or supporting terrorist activities may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our service. 

&#160;

In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security incident, or security breach for personal data, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often unclear and difficult to implement. The costs of compliance with these laws are significant and may increase in the future. Further, we may be subject to significant liabilities if we fail to comply with these laws. 

&#160;

We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of member data. We post on our websites our privacy policy and terms of use. Compliance with privacy-related laws may be costly. However, any failure by us to comply with our privacy policy or privacy-related laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or private parties, which could be detrimental to our business. Further, any failure by us to protect our members&#8217; privacy and data could result in a loss of member confidence in us and ultimately in a loss of members and customers, which could adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

Because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure. 

&#160;

Our direct marketing operations with respect to the NAPW Network are subject to various federal and state &#8220;do not call&#8221; list requirements. The Federal Trade Commission has created a national &#8220;do not call&#8221; registry. Under these federal regulations, consumers may have their phone numbers added to the national &#8220;do not call&#8221; registry. Generally, we are prohibited from calling anyone on that registry. In September 2003, telemarketers were granted access to the registry and are now required to compare their call lists against the national &#8220;do not call&#8221; registry at least once every 31 days. Telemarketers are required to pay a fee to access the registry. Enforcement of the &#8220;do not call&#8221; provisions began in late 2003, and the rule provides for fines of up to $16,000 per violation and other possible penalties. These rules may be construed to limit our ability to market our products and services to new customers. Further, we may incur penalties if we do not conduct our telemarketing activities in compliance with these rules. 

&#160;

Our opt-in process with respect to Noble Voice is governed by the provisions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (&#8220; TCPA &#8221;) and other federal and state laws and regulations. Under these regulations, certain types of telephone solicitations are restricted and consumers must affirmatively opt in to being contacted by various methods including automated dialing systems and via text messaging. The TCPA provides for a private right of action against companies that violate its provisions, and allows consumers to sue for up to $1,500 per violation. These regulations may be construed to limit our ability to market our products and services to new customers. Further, we may incur penalties if we do not conduct our opt-in process in compliance with these rules. 

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Our quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonality of employers&#8217; businesses. Historically, demand for employment hiring is lower during the first quarter and typically increases during the remainder of the year. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 355 employees, of which 182 were full time employees. We also regularly engage independent contractors to perform various services. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
