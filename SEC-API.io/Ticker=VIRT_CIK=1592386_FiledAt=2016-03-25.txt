BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Virtu is a leading technology &#8209;enabled market maker and liquidity provider to the global financial markets. We stand ready, at any time, to buy or sell a broad range of securities and other financial instruments, and we generate revenue by buying and selling securities and other financial instruments and earning small bid/ask spreads across a large volume of transactions. We make markets by providing quotations to buyers and sellers in more than 12,000 securities and other financial instruments on more than 230 unique exchanges, markets and liquidity pools in 35 countries around the world. We believe that our broad diversification, in combination with our proprietary technology platform and low &#8209;cost structure, enables us to facilitate risk transfer between global capital markets participants by supplying liquidity and competitive pricing while at the same time earning attractive margins and returns. 

&#160; 

We believe that market makers like us serve an important role in maintaining and improving the overall health and efficiency of the global capital markets by continuously posting bids and offers for financial instruments and thereby providing to market participants an efficient means to transfer risk. All market participants benefit from the increased liquidity, lower overall trading costs and enhanced execution certainty that we provide. While we do not have customers in a traditional sense, we make markets for global banks, brokers and other intermediaries, and indirectly provide services to retail and institutional investors, including corporations, individuals, hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and other investors, all of whom can access our liquidity on exchanges or venues in order to transfer risk in 

&#160;

multiple securities and asset classes for their own accounts and/or on behalf of their customers. The following table illustrates the diversification of our revenues:

&#160; 

We refer to our market making activities as being &#8220;market neutral,&#8221; which means that we are not dependent on the direction of any particular market nor do we speculate. Our market making activities are designed to minimize capital at risk at any given time by limiting the notional size of our positions. Our strategies are also designed to lock in returns through precise hedging in the primary instrument or in one or more economically equivalent instruments, as we seek to eliminate the price risk in any positions held. Our revenue generation is driven primarily by transaction volume across a broad range of securities and other financial instruments, asset classes and geographies. We avoid the risk of long or short positions in favor of seeking to earn small bid/ask spreads on large trading volumes across thousands of securities and financial instruments. 

&#160; 

We do not engage in the types of principal investing and predictive, momentum and signal trading in which many other broker &#8209;dealers and trading firms engage. In fact, in order to minimize the likelihood of unintended activities by our market making strategies, if our risk management system detects a trading strategy generating revenues outside of our preset limits, it will freeze, or &#8220;lockdown,&#8221; that strategy and alert risk management personnel and management. Although this approach may prevent us from maximizing potential returns in times of extreme market volatility, we believe the reduction in risk is an appropriate trade &#8209;off that is in keeping with our aim of generating consistently strong revenue from trading. 

&#160; 

Our market making activities employ the following three basic strategies: a &#8220;single instrument&#8221; market making strategy, a &#8220;one to one&#8221; market making strategy and a &#8220;one to many&#8221; market making strategy. The single instrument market making strategy involves actively quoting in a single instrument with the intention of profiting by capturing the spread between the bid and offer. This strategy places buy orders, or bids, and sell orders, or offers, in the market for the subject instrument at or near the inside of the market with the intention of achieving an execution. If another market participant executes against the strategy&#8217;s bid or offer by crossing the spread, the strategy will attempt to exit the position by continuing to quote on the opposite side of the market in order to execute an offsetting position. The one to one market making strategy involves continuously quoting a two &#8209;sided market in a single instrument with the intention of 

&#160;

either capturing the spread in the primary instrument or locking in a return by hedging in a different but economically similar instrument. The one to many market making strategy involves continuously quoting a two &#8209;sided market in a primary instrument (typically an ETF) with the intention of either capturing the spread in the primary instrument or attempting to lock in a return by hedging in a basket of instruments that represent an economically equivalent value to the primary instrument. 

&#160; 

Technology and operational efficiency are at the core of our business, and our focus on market making technology is a key element of our success. We have developed a proprietary, multi &#8209;asset, multi &#8209;currency technology platform that is highly reliable, scalable and modular, and we integrate directly with exchanges and other liquidity centers. Our market data, order routing, transaction processing, risk management and market surveillance technology modules manage our market making activities in an efficient manner and enable us to scale our market making activities globally and across additional securities and other financial instruments and asset classes without significant incremental costs or third &#8209;party licensing or processing fees. 

&#160; 

We are a self &#8209;clearing registered broker &#8209;dealer in the U.S. and are registered with the Central Bank of Ireland for our European trading. We participate on more than 230 unique exchanges, markets and liquidity pools globally as of December 31, 2015, and register as a market maker or liquidity provider and/or enter into direct obligations to provide liquidity on nearly every exchange or venue that offers such programs. We engage regularly with regulators around the world on issues affecting electronic trading and have been a proponent with the SEC of affirmative market making obligations for electronic market makers in U.S. equities in an effort to enhance the transparency and liquidity provided to capital markets. In the U.S., we conduct our business from our headquarters in New York, New York and our trading center in Austin, Texas. Abroad, we conduct our business through trading centers located in Dublin and Singapore. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Market Making 

&#160; 

As a leading, low &#8209;cost market maker dedicated to providing improved efficiency and liquidity across multiple securities, asset classes and geographies, we aim to provide critical market functionality and robust price competition, leading to reduced trading costs and more efficient pricing in the securities and other financial instruments in which we provide liquidity. This contribution to the financial markets, and the scale and diversity of our market making activities, provides added liquidity and transparency, which we believe are necessary and valued components to the efficient functioning of market infrastructure and benefit all market participants. We support transparent and efficient, technologically advanced marketplaces, and advocate for legislation and regulation that promotes fair and transparent access to markets. 

&#160; 

We make markets in a number of different assets classes, which are discussed in more detail below. 

&#160; 

Americas Equities 

&#160; 

Americas equities trading accounted for approximately 27% and 26% of our Adjusted Net Trading Income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We trade approximately 6,000 Americas equity securities including, among others, equity related futures and exchange traded funds, on eleven SEC registered exchanges as well as other alternative trading systems, including the NYSE, the NASDAQ, Direct Edge, NYSE Arca, BATS and IEX, the TSX in Canada, Bovespa in Brazil and BMV in Mexico, and we connect to more than 20 private liquidity pools. In 2011, we became a DMM in over 260 stocks on the floor of the NYSE and the NYSE MKT (formerly NYSE Amex), and we are seeking to increase the number of listed NYSE stocks for which we serve as a DMM. 

&#160; 

As exchange traded funds, or &#8220;ETFs,&#8221; and other similar products have proliferated both domestically and internationally, demand has increased for trading the underlying assets or hedging such funds. Our technology has enabled us to expand into providing liquidity to this growing area by making markets across these assets in a variety of trading venues globally. We are authorized participants and can create and/or redeem ETFs in Americas equities, EMEA equities and APAC equities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

EMEA Equities 

&#160; 

EMEA equities trading accounted for approximately 12% and 12% of our Adjusted Net Trading Income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Similar to our strategy in the Americas, we utilize direct connections to all of the registered exchanges in a particular jurisdiction including the LSE, BATS Europe and NYSE Euronext, as well as any additional pools of liquidity to which we can gain access either directly or through a broker. We are also well positioned in European ETFs, as an authorized participant in many European ETFs. In addition, after our acquisition of the ETF market making assets of Nyenburgh, we provide two &#8209;sided liquidity to a significant number of counterparties throughout Europe. 

&#160; 

APAC Equities 

&#160; 

APAC equities trading accounted for approximately 9% and 7% of our Adjusted Net Trading Income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We utilize direct connections to the ASX, TSX and SGX, among other exchanges and liquidity pools. 

&#160; 

Global Commodities 

&#160; 

Trading in global commodities accounted for approximately 23% and 21% of our Adjusted Net Trading Income for the years ended December, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During these periods, we were a leading participant and liquidity provider on both the CME and ICE in trading crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, gasoline futures and precious metals. We trade approximately 100 energy products and futures on the ICE, CME, TOCOM and NYSE Liffe US. We also actively trade precious metals, including gold, silver, platinum and palladium, as well as base metals such as aluminum and copper. 

&#160; 

Global Currencies 

&#160; 

Trading in global currencies, including spot, futures and forwards, accounted for approximately 22% and 25% of our Adjusted Net Trading Income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During these periods, we were a leading participant in the major foreign exchange venues, including Reuters, Currenex, Hotspot FX and EBS. Currency trading has historically utilized intermediaries and large broker &#8209;dealers, and as a result, market making opportunities in foreign exchange have been limited. 

&#160; 

Options, Fixed Income and Other Securities 

&#160; 

Trading in options, U.S. and foreign government fixed income products and other products accounted for approximately 6% and 10% of our Adjusted Net Trading Income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We trade these products on a variety of specialized exchanges and other trading venues, including all of the U.S. options exchanges of which we are a member (i.e., CBOE, ISE and NYSE Arca) and through the U.S. futures exchanges. We believe that we can increase our volumes in certain of these products. 

&#160; 

Technology 

&#160; 

Technology is at the core of our business. Our team of in-house software engineers develops all of our software and applications, and we utilize optimized infrastructure to integrate directly with the exchanges and other trading venues on which we provide liquidity. Wherever possible, we lease commercially available rack space that is co &#8209;located with, or in close proximity to, the exchanges and other venues where we provide liquidity. We do not pay any licensing or per &#8209;trade processing fees to any third parties, and the engineering cycles for enhancements or new technologies are entirely within our control. Our focus on technology and our ability to leverage our technology enables us to be one of the lowest cost providers of liquidity to the global electronic trading marketplace. 

&#160; 

We have developed and refined, in &#8209;house, a single proprietary, scalable and modular technology platform that we directly integrate with exchanges and other trading venues through our customized infrastructure to provide continuous bid and offer quotations on a wide variety of assets traded electronically around the world. Our platform 

&#160;

incorporates market data and evaluates risk exposure on a real &#8209;time basis to update outstanding quotes often many times per second, enabling us to offer competitive bid/ask spreads. Our high degree of automation reduces our costs, and we believe our cost per trade is as low as or lower than any other market participants. Leveraging the scalability and low costs of our platform, we are able to test and rapidly deploy new liquidity provisioning strategies, expand to new securities, asset classes and geographies and increase transaction volumes at little incremental cost. These efficiencies are central to our ability to deliver consistently positive Adjusted Net Trading Income as our profitability per trade and per instrument is not significant, particularly in U.S. equities. 

&#160; 

Our transaction processing is automated over the full life cycle of a trade. Our platform generates and disseminates continuous bid and offer quotes on over 12,000 tradable listed products. At the moment a trade is executed, our systems capture and deliver this information back to the source, in most cases within a fraction of a second, and the trade record is written into our clearing system, where it flows through a chain of control accounts that allow us to reconcile trades, positions and payments until the final settlement occurs. 

&#160; 

Our core software technology is developed internally, and we do not generally rely on outside vendors for software development or maintenance. To achieve optimal performance from our systems, we continuously test and upgrade our software. Our focus on cutting &#8209;edge technology not only improves our performance but also helps us attract and retain talented developers. 

&#160; 

Virtually all of our software has been developed and maintained with a unified purpose. We track and test new software releases with proprietary automated testing tools and are not hindered by disparate or limiting legacy systems assembled through acquisitions. 

&#160; 

We have built and continuously refine our automated and integrated, real &#8209;time systems for global trading, risk management, clearing and cash management, among other purposes. We have also assembled a proprietary connectivity network between us and exchanges around the world. Efficiency and speed in performing prescribed functions are always crucial requirements for our systems, and generally we focus on opportunities in markets that are sufficiently advanced to allow the seamless deployment of our automated strategies, risk management system and core technology. 

&#160; 

Our systems are monitored 24 hours a day, five days a week by our core operations team and are substantially identical across our four offices, in New York, New York, Austin, Texas, Dublin, Ireland and Singapore. This redundancy covers our full technology platform, including our market data, order routing, transaction processing, risk management and market surveillance technology modules. Because our systems can be operated by qualified personnel in any office at any time across our globally distributed offices, we have an effective, organic disaster recovery and business continuity plan in place, allowing for seamless operation of our trading strategies in the event of disruption. 

&#160; 

Risk Management 

&#160; 

We are intensely focused on risk management and monitor our activities on a continuous basis using our fully integrated technology systems. Our market making strategies are designed to put minimal capital at risk at any given time by limiting the notional size of our positions. Our strategies are also designed to lock in returns through precise hedging in the primary instrument or in one or more economically equivalent instruments, as we seek to eliminate the price risk in any positions held. Our real &#8209;time risk management system is built into our trading platform and is an integral part of our order life &#8209;cycle, analyzing real &#8209;time pricing data and ensuring that our order activity is conducted within strict pre &#8209;determined trading and position limits. If our risk management system detects that a trading strategy is generating revenues or losses in excess of our preset limits, it will lockdown that strategy and alert management. In addition, our risk management system continuously reconciles our internal transaction records against the records of the exchanges and other liquidity centers with which we interact. 

&#160; 

Risk management is at the core of our trading infrastructure. Our real &#8209;time risk controls monitor all of our market making positions, incorporating market data and evaluating our risk exposure to continuously update our outstanding bid and offer quotes, often many times per second. Although our market making is automated, the trading process and our risk exposure are monitored by a team of individuals, including members of our senior management 

&#160;

team, who oversee our risk management processes in real-time. Our risk management system is intrinsic to our trading infrastructure that is utilized in each of our four trading centers. 

&#160; 

Our risk management policies are set by our Risk Advisory Committee and overseen by our Chief Risk Officer. We utilize the following three &#8209;pronged approach to managing risk: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Strategy Lockdowns. Messages that leave our trading environment must first pass through a series of preset risk controls, or &#8220;lockdowns,&#8221; which are intended to minimize the likelihood of unintended activities by our market making algorithms, and which cannot be modified by our traders. Not only do we implement preset risk controls to limit downside risk, but we also do the same to limit upside risk &#8212; if our risk management system detects that a trading strategy is generating revenues or losses in excess of our preset limits, a lockdown will be triggered. When a lockdown is triggered, our risk management system alerts us and automatically freezes the applicable trading strategy, cancels all applicable open orders and prevents the placement of additional related orders. Following a lockdown, a trader must manually reset the applicable trading strategy. While this risk prevention layer adds a degree of latency to our trading infrastructure and can prevent us from earning outsized returns in times of extreme market volatility, we believe that this trade &#8209;off is necessary to properly limit our downside risk. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Aggregate Exposure Monitoring. Pursuant to our risk management policies, our automated management information systems generate reports in real &#8209;time, as well as on daily and periodic bases. These reports include risk profiles, profit and loss analyses and trading performance reports. Our assets and liabilities are marked &#8209;to &#8209;market daily for financial reporting purposes by reference to official exchange prices, and they are re &#8209;valued continuously throughout the trading day for risk management and asset/liability management purposes. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Operational Controls. We have automated the full cycle of controls of our business. Key automated controls include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

our technical operations system continuously monitors our network and the proper functioning of each of our trading centers around the world; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

our market making system continuously evaluates over 11,000 listed securities in which we provide bid and offer quotes and changes its bids and offers in such a way as to minimize exposure to directional price movements. The speed of communicating with exchanges and market centers is maximized through continuous software and network engineering innovation, allowing us to achieve real &#8209;time controls over market exposure. We connect to exchanges and other electronic venues through a network of co &#8209;location facilities around the world that are monitored 24 hours a day, five days a week, by our staff of experienced network professionals; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

our clearing system captures trades in real-time and performs automated reconciliations of trades and positions, corporate action processing, options exercises, securities lending and inventory management, allowing us to effectively manage operational risk; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

software developed to support our market making systems performs daily profit and loss and position reconciliations. 

&#160; 

In addition, we seek to minimize our liquidity risk by focusing our trading in highly active and liquid instruments. The diversity of assets and venues in which we provide liquidity serves as a further form of portfolio risk management. 

&#160; 

Our Risk Advisory Committee includes key personnel from each of our locations globally and is comprised of our Chief Risk Officer, members of our senior management team, senior technologists and traders, and certain senior compliance officers. Our board of directors is regularly apprised of the activities of our Risk Advisory Committee and 

&#160;

our risk management policies, procedures and controls through board updates and other communications. All of our risk controls and settings are reviewed and approved by our Risk Advisory Committee. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Historically, our competition has been registered market making firms ranging from sole proprietors with very limited resources to large, integrated broker &#8209;dealers. Today, a range of market participants may compete with us for revenues generated by market making activities across one or more asset classes and geographies, including large broker &#8209;dealers, such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co., Morgan Stanley and UBS, and other participants, such as Citadel, DRW Holdings, Hudson River Trading, IMC, KCG Holdings, Optiver, Susquehanna, Timber Hill and Wolverine Trading. Some of our competitors in market making are larger than we are and have more captive order flow in certain assets. We believe that the high cost of developing a competitive technological framework is a significant barrier to entry by new market participants. 

&#160; 

We believe that we must have more sophisticated, versatile and robust software than our competitors in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Technology and software innovation is a primary focus for us, rather than relying solely on the speed of our network. We believe that our scalable technology allows us to access new markets and increase volumes with limited incremental costs. 

&#160; 

In addition, we believe our lack of direct customers and customer accounts allows us increased flexibility as we face fewer constraints in reallocating resources to pursue market opportunities as they arise. We are also a self &#8209;clearing DTC participant, so we avoid paying clearing fees to third parties in our U.S. equities market making business. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

We rely primarily on trade secret, trademark, domain name, copyright and contract law to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. We enter into confidentiality, intellectual property invention assignment and/or non &#8209;competition and non &#8209;solicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees, independent contractors and business partners, and we strictly control access to, and distribution of, our intellectual property. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 148 employees, all of whom were employed on a full &#8209;time basis. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

We conduct our U.S. equities market making activities through our two SEC &#8209;registered broker &#8209;dealers, Virtu Financial BD LLC and Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC. Virtu Financial BD LLC is a self &#8209;clearing broker &#8209;dealer, is regulated by the SEC and its designated examining authority is the Chicago Stock Exchange. Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC is a dual &#8209;clearing broker &#8209;dealer (which means it self &#8209;clears its proprietary transactions and executes on an agency basis on behalf of its 100% commonly held affiliates and non-affiliated broker dealers), is regulated by the SEC and its designated examining authority is FINRA. 

&#160; 

Our activities in U.S. equities are almost entirely self &#8209;cleared. We are a full clearing member of the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC), and the DTC. In other asset classes, we use the services of prime brokers who provide us direct market access to markets and often cross &#8209;margining and margin financing in return for an execution and clearing fee. We continually monitor the credit quality of our prime brokers and rely on large multinational banks for most of our execution and clearing needs globally. 

&#160; 

Our energy, commodities and currency market making and trading activities are primarily conducted through Virtu Financial Global Markets LLC. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We conduct our EMEA market making and trading activities from Dublin and through our Irish subsidiaries, Virtu Financial Ireland Limited, which is authorized as an &#8220;Investment Firm&#8221; with the Central Bank of Ireland, and Virtu Financial Europe Limited. 

&#160; 

We conduct our APAC market making and trading activities from Singapore and through our Singapore subsidiary, Virtu Financial Singapore Pte. Ltd., and our Australian subsidiary, Virtu Financial Asia Pty. Ltd. Virtu Financial Singapore Pte. Ltd. is registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore for an investment incentive arrangement, and Virtu Financial Asia Pty. Ltd. holds a financial services license issued by, and is therefore subject to the regulatory oversight of, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. 

&#160; 

Most aspects of our business are subject to extensive regulation under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the various SROs of which our subsidiaries are members. The SEC, CFTC, state securities regulators, FCA, SFC, FINRA, NFA, other SROs and other U.S. and foreign governmental regulatory bodies promulgate numerous rules and regulations that may impact our business. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors in those markets. Regulated entities are subject to regulations concerning all aspects of their business, including trading practices, order handling, best execution practices, anti &#8209;money laundering, handling of material non &#8209;public information, safeguarding data, securities credit, capital adequacy, reporting, record retention, market access and the conduct of officers, employees and other associated persons. We do not carry customer accounts and are therefore exempt from otherwise applicable SEC requirements relating to the protection of customer securities and the maintenance of a cash reserve account for the benefit of customers. 

&#160; 

Rulemaking by these and other regulators (foreign and domestic), including resulting market structure changes, has had an impact on our regulated subsidiaries by directly affecting our method of operation and, at times, our profitability. Legislation can impose, and has imposed, significant obligations on broker &#8209;dealers, including our regulated subsidiaries. These increased obligations require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls which have increased our costs and may subject us to government and regulatory inquiries, claims or penalties. 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with any laws, rules or regulations could result in administrative or court proceedings, censures, fines, penalties, disgorgement and censures, suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction, SRO or market, the revocation or limitation of licenses, the issuance of cease &#8209;and &#8209;desist orders or injunctions or the suspension or disqualification of the entity and/or its officers, employees or other associated persons. These administrative or court proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures of time and money and can have an adverse impact on a firm&#8217;s reputation and profitability. 

&#160; 

The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to constant change. Our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the U.S. Congress, foreign legislative bodies, state securities regulators, U.S. and foreign governmental regulatory bodies and SROs. Additional regulations, changes in existing laws and rules, or changes in interpretations or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of regulated broker &#8209;dealers. Since March 2014, we and other broker &#8209;dealers and trading firms have been the subject of requests for information and documents from the SEC and NYAG. We have cooperated and complied with the SEC&#8217;s and NYAG&#8217;s requests for information and documents. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have. However, there have been in the past, and could be in the future, significant technological, operational and compliance costs associated with the obligations which derive from compliance with such regulations. 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd &#8209;Frank Act was enacted in the U.S. Implementation of the Dodd &#8209;Frank Act is being be accomplished through extensive rulemaking by the SEC, the CFTC and other governmental agencies. The Dodd &#8209;Frank Act includes the &#8220;Volcker Rule,&#8221; which significantly limits the ability of banks and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading, and Title VII, which provides a framework for the regulation of the swap markets. The CFTC has largely finalized its rules with respect to those swaps markets and participants it regulates, while the SEC has not yet completed all of its rules relating to security &#8209;based swaps. One of our subsidiaries is registered with the CFTC as a floor 

&#160;

trader, and is exempt from registration as a swap dealer based on its current activity. Registration as a swap dealer would subject our subsidiary to various requirements, including those related to capital, conduct, and reporting. 

&#160; 

We have foreign subsidiaries and plan to continue to expand our international presence. The market making industry in many foreign countries is heavily regulated, much like in the U.S. The varying compliance requirements of these different regulatory jurisdictions and other factors may limit our ability to conduct business or expand internationally. For example, Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#8220;MiFID&#8221;), which was implemented in November 2007, is now under further review by the European Parliament. MiFID represented one of the more significant changes to take place in the operation of European capital markets. In October 2012, the European Parliament adopted, with amendments, MiFID II/MiFIR. MiFID II entered into force on July 2, 2014 with an effective date of January 3, 2017. It is widely expected that the effective date will be delayed to 2018. Some broader trends of the proposals address increased transparency and oversight of financial firms, with a focus on high frequency trading, broker liquidity private pools, crossing networks and multilateral trading facilities. For example, the current proposal would require firms like us to conduct all trading on European markets through authorized investment firms. MiFID II/MiFIR will also require certain types of firms, including us, to post firm quotes at competitive prices and will supplement current requirements with regard to investment firms&#8217; risk controls related to the safe operation of electronic systems. MiFID II/MiFIR may also impose additional requirements on our trading platforms, such as a minimum order resting time, cancellation fees, circuit breakers and limits on the ratio of unexecuted orders to trades. Each of these proposals may impose technological and compliance costs on us. Any of these laws, rules or regulations, if adopted, as well as any regulatory or legal actions or proceedings, changes in legislation or regulation and changes in market customs and practices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital rules of the SEC, FINRA, other SROs and foreign regulators. These rules, which specify minimum capital requirements for our regulated subsidiaries, are designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker &#8209;dealer and require that at least a minimum part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Failure to maintain required minimum capital may subject a regulated subsidiary to a fine, requirement to cease conducting business, suspension, revocation of registration or expulsion by applicable regulatory authorities, and ultimately could require the relevant entity&#8217;s liquidation. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; Failure to comply with applicable regulatory capital requirements could subject us to sanctions imposed by the SEC, FINRA and other SROs or regulatory bodies.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

We and our predecessors have been in the electronic trading and market making business for approximately 12 years. We conduct our business through Virtu Financial LLC (&#8220;Virtu Financial&#8221;) and its subsidiaries. On July 8, 2011, we completed our acquisition of Madison Tyler Holdings, which was co-founded in 2002 by Mr. Vincent Viola, our Founder and Executive Chairman. In connection with the acquisition, Virtu Financial paid approximately $536.5 million in cash and issued interests in Virtu Financial to the members of Madison Tyler Holdings and Virtu Financial Operating LLC ("Virtu East"). To finance the Madison Tyler Transactions, (i) an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners invested approximately $250.0 million in Virtu Financial, (ii) an affiliate of Mr. Viola invested approximately $19.6 million in Virtu Financial and (iii) Virtu Financial borrowed approximately $304.4 million, net of fees and expenses, under a term loan facility, which we refer to (as amended to date) as our "senior secured credit facility." The business that comprises Virtu Financial today is the result of the Madison Tyler Transactions, which combined Virtu East, our historical business, with Madison Tyler Holdings. 

&#160; 

On December 31, 2014, through a series of transactions, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited, whom we refer to as "Temasek," acting through two indirect wholly owned subsidiaries, acquired (i) direct interests in Virtu Financial from affiliates of Silver Lake Partners, Virtu Financial and a member of management (other than Messrs. Viola and Cifu and their affiliates) and (ii) indirect interests in Virtu Financial by acquiring an interest in an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Reorganization Transactions 

&#160; 

Prior to the consummation of the reorganization transactions described below and our initial public offering, all of Virtu Financial's outstanding equity interests, including its Class A-1 interests, Class A-2 capital interests, Class A-2 profits interests and Class B interests, were owned by the following persons, whom we refer to collectively as the "Virtu Pre-IPO Members": 

&#160; 

&#183; 

three affiliates of Mr. Viola, whom we refer to collectively as the "Founder Pre-IPO Members"; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners, whom we refer to as the "Silver Lake Pre-IPO Member"; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

an affiliate of Temasek, whom we refer to as the "Temasek Pre-IPO Member"; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners and Temasek, whom we refer to as the "SLT Pre-IPO Member" and whom we refer to collectively with the Silver Lake Pre-IPO Member and the Temasek Pre-IPO Member as the "Investor Pre-IPO Members"; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

two entities, both of which were managed by Mr. Viola, whose equityholders included certain members of the management of Virtu Financial, whom we refer to together as the "Management Vehicles." Certain of the equity interests held by the Management Vehicles were subject to vesting restrictions; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

certain current and former members of the management of Virtu Financial and Madison Tyler Holdings and their affiliates, whom we refer to collectively as the "Management Members." Certain of the equity interests held by the Management Members were subject to vesting restrictions. 

&#160; 

Prior to the completion of our initial public offering, we completed an internal reorganization, which we refer to as the "reorganization transactions." In connection with the reorganization transactions, the following steps occurred: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

we became the sole managing member of Virtu Financial; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

in a series of transactions, one of the Management Vehicles liquidated, with its equity interests in Virtu Financial either being distributed to its members, including certain members of management, or contributed to the other Management Vehicle (which we refer to as "Virtu Employee Holdco") and certain employees of ours based outside the United States were distributed equity interests in Virtu Financial held by Virtu Employee Holdco on behalf of such employees and such equity interests were contributed to a trust (which we refer to as the "Employee Trust"), whose trustee is one of our subsidiaries; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

two of the Founder Pre-IPO Members liquidated and distributed their equity interests in Virtu Financial to their equityholders, one of whom was TJMT Holdings LLC, the third Founder Pre-IPO Member; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the SLT Pre-IPO Member distributed its equity interests in Virtu Financial to its equityholders, which consisted of investment funds and other entities affiliated with Silver Lake Partners and Temasek; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

following a series of transactions, we acquired equity interests in Virtu Financial as a result of certain mergers involving wholly owned subsidiaries of ours, an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners and Temasek, and the Temasek Pre-IPO Member (the "Mergers"), and in exchange we issued to an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners, whom we refer to as the "Silver Lake Post-IPO Stockholder," and an affiliate of Temasek, whom we refer to as the "Temasek Post-IPO Stockholder" and whom we refer to together with the Silver Lake Post-IPO Stockholder as the "Investor Post-IPO Stockholders," shares of our Class A common stock and rights to receive payments under a tax receivable agreement described below. The number of shares of Class A common stock issued to the Investor Post-IPO Stockholders was based on the value of the Virtu Financial equity interests that we acquired, which was determined based on a hypothetical liquidation of Virtu Financial and the initial public offering price per share of our Class A common stock in our initial public offering; 

&#160;

&#183; 

all of the existing equity interests in Virtu Financial were reclassified into Virtu Financial's non-voting common interest units, which we refer to as "Virtu Financial Units." The number of Virtu Financial Units issued to each member of Virtu Financial was determined based on a hypothetical liquidation of Virtu Financial and the initial public offering price per share of our Class A common stock in our initial public offering. The Virtu Financial Units received by Virtu Employee Holdco, the Employee Trust and the Management Members have the same vesting restrictions as the equity interests that were reclassified. Vested Virtu Financial Units are entitled to receive distributions, if any, from Virtu Financial. Subject to certain exceptions, unvested Virtu Financial Units are not entitled to receive such distributions (other than tax distributions). If any unvested Virtu Financial Units are forfeited, they are cancelled by Virtu Financial for no consideration (and we cancel the related shares of Class C common stock (described below) for no consideration); 

&#160; 

&#183; 

we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation and are authorized to issue four classes of common stock: Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C common stock and Class D common stock, which we refer to collectively as our "common stock." The Class A common stock and Class C common stock each provide holders with one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, and the Class B common stock and Class D common stock each provide holders with 10 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. The holders of Class C common stock and Class D common stock do not have any of the economic rights (including rights to dividends and distributions upon liquidation) provided to holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. These attributes are summarized in the following table: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Class of Common Stock 

Votes 

Economic Rights 

Class A of common stock 

Yes 

Class B of common stock 

Yes 

Class C of common stock 

No 

Class D of common stock 

No 

&#160; 

Shares of our common stock generally vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the remaining members of Virtu Financial after giving effect to the reorganization transactions, other than us, whom we refer to collectively as the "Virtu Post-IPO Members," subscribed for and purchased shares of our common stock as follows, in each case at a purchase price of $0.00001 per share and in an amount equal to the number of Virtu Financial Units held by each such Virtu Post-IPO Member: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

TJMT Holdings LLC, whom we refer to as the "Founder Post-IPO Member," purchased 79,610,490 shares of our Class D common stock; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

affiliates of Silver Lake Partners, whom we refer to as the "Silver Lake Post-IPO Members," Virtu Employee Holdco, the Employee Trust, the Management Members and the other Virtu Post-IPO Members purchased 36,746,041 shares of our Class C common stock; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the Founder Post-IPO Member was granted the right to exchange its Virtu Financial Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of our Class D common stock, for shares of our Class B common stock, and the other Virtu Post-IPO Members were granted the right to exchange their Virtu Financial Units, together with a corresponding number of shares of our Class C common stock, for shares of our Class A common stock. Each share of our Class B common stock and Class D common stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A common stock or Class C common stock, respectively. 

&#160; 

The Founder Post-IPO Member controls approximately 93.1% of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the Founder Post-IPO Member controls any action requiring the general approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of 

&#160;

incorporation and by-laws and the approval of any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. The Founder Post-IPO Member is controlled by family members of Mr. Viola, our Founder and Executive Chairman. 

&#160; 

Initial Public Offering 

&#160; 

On April 21, 2015, the Company completed its IPO of 19,012,112 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, including 2,479,840 shares of Class A common stock sold in connection with the full exercise of the option to purchase additional shares granted to the underwriters, at a price to the public of $19.00 per share. The shares began trading on NASDAQ on April 16, 2015 under the ticker symbol &#8220;VIRT.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Upon consummation of the IPO, the total gross proceeds of the offering were approximately $361.2 million. Of the proceeds, approximately $25.2 million was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions, approximately $277.2 million was used to purchase 3,470,724 shares of Class A common stock from affiliates of Silver Lake Partners (the &#8220;Silver Lake Post-IPO Stockholder&#8221;) and 12,214,224 Virtu Financial Units and corresponding shares of Class C common stock from certain of the Virtu Post-IPO Members, including 4,862,609 Virtu Financial Units and corresponding shares of Class C common stock from affiliates of the Silver Lake Partners (the &#8220;Silver Lake Post-IPO Members&#8221;) and 7,351,615 Virtu Financial Units from certain employees. The remaining $58.8 million of net proceeds was contributed by the Company to Virtu Financial, the operating company, which will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Other offering costs incurred were approximately $8.6 million and were paid by Virtu Financial. 

&#160; 

Secondary Offering 

&#160; 

In November 2015, the secondary offering (the &#8220;Secondary Offering&#8221;) of 6,473,371 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock was completed by the Company and certain selling stockholders affiliated with Silver Lake Partners. The selling stockholders sold 6,075,837 shares of Class A common stock and the Company sold 397,534 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $22.15 per share. The selling stockholders received all of the net proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common stock by them in the offering. The Company used its net proceeds from the offering to purchase common units in Virtu Financial (and paired shares of Class C common stock) from one of its non-executive employees at a net price equal to the price paid by the underwriters for shares of its Class A common stock. Following the Secondary Offering, Silver Lake Partners no longer holds any equity interest in us. As a result of the completion of the IPO, the reorganization transactions and the Secondary Offering, the Company holds approximately 27.5% interest in Virtu Financial at December 31, 2015.
