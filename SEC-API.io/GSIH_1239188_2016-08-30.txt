 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used herein the terms &#8220;General Steel&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; all refer to General Steel Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

&#160;

We were incorporated on August 5, 2002, in the State of Nevada. We are headquartered in Beijing, China and through our 100% owned subsidiary, General Steel Investment, we had been operating steel companies serving various industries in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;PRC&#8221;). Our main operation through December 30, 2015 had been the manufacturing and sales of steel products such as steel rebar, hot-rolled carbon and silicon sheets and spiral-weld pipes.

&#160;

Since the first quarter of 2015, in view of the near-term challenges for the steel manufacturing sector, we strategically accelerated our business transformation. Our transformation strategy is to pursue opportunities that offer compelling benefits to our organization and shareholders, including:

&#160;

&#183; strengthening the Company&#8217;s financials while providing the financial flexibility to pursue higher return, higher growth opportunities; &#183; reducing the complexity of the Company&#8217;s business structure, which is consistent with the Company&#8217;s objectives for internal simplification and operating efficiency; &#183; diversifying operating risk in order to lower the Company&#8217;s high reliance on steel business, while at the same time leverage on the Company&#8217;s vast vertical resources in the steel industry; and &#183; pursuing opportunities for additional value creation. &#160;

In June 2014, the Board approved our plan to transform from an integrated steel producer into a multi-faceted, synergistic platform that will comprise not only steel-related businesses but also high-growth, high-margin non-steel businesses.

&#160;

Our growth strategy is a combination of optimizing operating efficiencies in our steel business and expanding into other high-growth and high-margin non-steel industries:

&#160;

&#183; We aim to drive profitability through improved operational efficiencies and optimization of our cost structure and continual cooperation and partnerships with leading state-owned enterprises (SOEs). &#183; We aim to continue of focusing and expanding growth on our trading activities. &#160;

On November 4, 2015, the Board authorized the Company's management to pursue the potential sale of all its ownership in Maoming Hengda Steel Company, Ltd. (&#34;Maoming Hengda&#34;) and Longmen Joint Venture in order to unlock the hidden value in Maoming Hengda's land assets, as well as divest from and restructure the steel business. On December 30, 2015, we sold our equity interest in General Steel (China) Co., Ltd and Longmen Joint Venture. On March 21, 2016, we sold our equity interest in Maoming Hengda and completed the divestiture of our steel business as planned.

&#160;

In October 2015, we completed our acquisition of an 84.5% equity interest in Catalon Chemical Corp. (&#8220;Catalon&#8221;), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Virginia that develops and manufactures De-NOx honeycomb catalysts and industrial ceramics. Prior to December 31, 2015, we became aware of operational issues related to Catalon. It was determined that such issues might have affected Catalon&#8217;s prior operations, as well as its ability to conduct business in the future. As such, we are expected to cancel the shares issued to the 84.5% original owners of Catalon in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Because we have decided to dispose of Catalon in the near future, we are presenting Catalon&#8217;s remaining assets after impairment charges and liabilities as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 21 in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

Our remaining steel business is primarily comprised of Tianjin Shuangsi, a trading company that mainly sources overseas iron ore for steel mills we acquired 100% equity interest of on February 16, 2016.

&#160;

As a result of the restructuring, our former steel-related subsidiaries, including Longmen Joint Venture (prior to December 30, 2015), Maoming Hengda and our recently acquired non steel-related subsidiary, Catalon, all of which represented over a majority of our consolidated sales and operations, are presented as single-line items as assets held for sale and discontinued operations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

On July 18, 2016, we received a notice from the staff of the New York Stock Exchange (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;) stating that the NYSE has determined to commence proceedings to delist our common stock, and our common stock would be suspended at the close of trading on the same date.

&#160;

In the notice and in a public announcement distributed by the NYSE on July 18, 2016, the NYSE stated that we were previously deemed below compliance with the NYSE&#8217;s continued listing standard requiring listed companies to maintain either (i) at least $50 million in stockholders&#8217; equity or (ii) at least $50 million in total market capitalization on a 30 trading day average basis. The NYSE noted that they had previously accepted our 18-month plan to regain compliance with the listing standard. However, the NYSE stated that as of the expiration of the plan period on July 9, 2016, we were unable to demonstrate that we had regained compliance with the applicable continued listing standard. The NYSE also included in its public announcement that we were delayed in filing with the SEC of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.

&#160;

We appealed the delisting determination by submitting a request for review in writing to the Committee of the Board of Directors of the NYSE.

&#160;

Prior to the NYSE notice, we had presented to the NYSE the steps we intended to take to address the deficiencies raised by the staff at NYSE. We reached an agreement with a number of our current debt holders to forgive existing debt and/or exchange debt for equity, which when completed, would have increased our stockholders&#8217; equity to at least $50 million thereby satisfying the NYSE&#8217;s continued listing standard. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our appeal and our request for continued listing will be granted. Subsidiaries 

&#160;

We presently have controlling interests in one trading subsidiary and one internet-of-things subsidiary under continuing operations:

&#160;

&#183; Tianjin Shuangsi Trading Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tianjin Shuangsi&#8221;) &#183; Tongyong Shengyuan (Tianjin) Technology Development Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tongyong Shengyuan&#8221;) &#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Company, together with our subsidiary and majority owned subsidiary are referred to as the &#8220;Group.&#8221; Longmen Joint Venture, which was consolidated into our Company through December 30, 2015, represented the majority of our revenue. It was determined to be a variable interest entity in which we were considered the primary beneficiary, as fully explained below.

&#160;

General Steel (China) Co., Ltd 

&#160;

General Steel (China), formerly known as &#8220;Tianjin Daqiuzhuang Metal Sheet Co., Ltd.&#8221; started operations in 1988.

&#160;

On May 14, 2009, General Steel (China) changed its official name from &#8220;Tianjin Daqiuzhuang Metal Sheet Co., Ltd.&#8221; to better reflect its role as a merger and acquisition platform for steel company investments in China. In some instances, General Steel (China) retains the use of the name &#8220;Daqiuzhuang Metal&#8221; for brand recognition purposes within the industry.

&#160;

On January 1, 2010, General Steel (China) entered into a lease agreement with Tianjin Shuangjie Liansheng Rolled Steel Co., Ltd. (the &#8220;Lessee&#8221;), an unrelated third party, whereby General Steel (China) leased parts of its facility located at No. 1, Tonga Street, Daqiuzhuang Town, Jinghai County, Tianjin City to the Lessee for a monthly payment of $0.1 million (RMB 0.5 million). The lease expires in May 2021.

&#160;

On December 30, 2015, we sold 100% of our equity interest in General Steel (China) as a part of our plan to divest our steel business.

&#160;

Shaanxi Longmen Iron and Steel Co., Ltd 

&#160;

Effective June 1, 2007, through General Steel (China) and Tianjin Qiu Steel Investment Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Qiu Steel&#8221;), a 99% owned subsidiary of General Steel (China), we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Shaanxi Longmen Iron &#38; Steel Group Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Long Steel Group&#8221;) to form Shaanxi Longmen Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Longmen Joint Venture&#8221;). Through General Steel (China) and Qiu Steel, we invested approximately $39.3 million in cash and collectively held a 60% ownership interest in Longmen Joint Venture until April 29, 2011, when a 20-year Unified Management Agreement (the &#8220;Unified Management Agreement&#8221;) was entered into between our Company, Longmen Joint Venture, Shaanxi Coal and Shaanxi Steel. Longmen Joint Venture was determined as a Variable Interest Entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) and we are the primary beneficiary. 

&#160;

Longmen Joint Venture had five branch offices, four consolidated subsidiaries/VIE and one entity in which it has a noncontrolling interest. It employed approximately 8,400 full-time workers. In addition to steel production, Longmen Joint Venture operated transportation services through its Changlong Branch, located in Hancheng city, Shaanxi Province. Changlong Branch owned 177 vehicles and provides transportation services exclusively to Longmen Joint Venture

&#160;

Longmen Joint Venture&#8217;s rebar products are categorized within the steel industry as &#8220;longs&#8221; (in reference to their shape). Rebar is generally considered a regional product because its weight and dimension make it ill-suited for cost-effective long-haul ground transportation. By our estimates, the market demand for rebar in Shaanxi Province is six to eight million metric tons per year. Slightly more than half of this demand comes from Xi&#8217;an, the capital of Shaanxi Province, located 180km from Longmen Joint Venture&#8217;s main steel production site. Longmen Joint Venture is estimated to have approximately a 72% share of the Xi&#8217;an market for rebar.

&#160;

An established regional network of approximately one hundred twenty-eight distributors, together with smaller distributors and three sales offices sell Longmen Joint Venture&#8217;s products. All products are sold under the registered brand name of &#8220;Yulong&#8221;, which has strong regional recognition and awareness. Rebar and billet products carry ISO 9001 and 9002 certification and other of Longmen Joint Venture&#8217;s products have won national quality awards. Products produced at the facility have been used in the construction of the Yangtze River Three Gorges Dam, the Xi&#8217;an International Airport, the Xi&#8217;an city subway system and the Xi Luo Du and Xiang Jia Ba hydropower projects.

&#160;

From June 2009 to March 2011, we worked with Shaanxi Steel to build new iron and steel making facilities, including two 1,280 cubic meter blast furnaces, two 120 metric ton converters, one 400 square meter sintering machine and some auxiliary systems. As a result, Longmen Joint Venture incurred certain costs of construction as well as economic losses on suspended production of certain small furnaces and other equipment to accommodate the construction of the new equipment, on behalf of Shaanxi Steel.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On April 29, 2011, a 20-year Unified Management Agreement (&#8220;the Agreement&#8221;) was entered into between the Company, the Company&#8217;s 60%-owned subsidiary Shaanxi Longmen Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Longmen Joint Venture&#8221;), Shaanxi Coal and Chemical Industry Group Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Shaanxi Coal&#8221;) and Shaanxi Iron and Steel Group (&#8220;Shaanxi Steel&#8221;). Shaanxi Steel is the controlling shareholder of Shaanxi Longmen Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd (&#8220;Long Steel Group&#8221;) which is the non-controlling interest holder in Longmen Joint Venture, and Shaanxi Coal, a state owned entity, is the parent company of Shaanxi Steel. Under the terms of the Agreement, all manufacturing machinery and equipment of Longmen Joint Venture and the $605.8 million (or approximately RMB 3.7 billion) of the constructed iron and steel making facilities owned by Shaanxi Steel, which includes one 400 m 2 sintering machine, two 1,280 m 3 blast furnaces, two 120 ton converters and some auxiliary systems, are managed collectively as a single virtual asset pool (&#8220;Asset Pool&#8221;). Longmen Joint Venture manages the Asset Pool as the principal operating entity and is responsible for the daily operations of the new and existing facilities. The Agreement leverages each of the parties&#8217; operating strengths, allowing Longmen Joint Venture to derive the greatest benefit from the cooperation and the newly constructed iron and steel making facilities. At the designed efficiency level, the facilities contribute three million tons of crude steel production capacity per year.

&#160;

Longmen Joint Venture paid Shaanxi Steel for the use of the constructed iron and steel making facilities an amount equaling the depreciation expense on the equipment constructed by Shaanxi Steel as well as 40% of the pre-tax profit generated by the Asset Pool. The remaining 60% of the pre-tax profit was allocated to Longmen Joint Venture. The distribution of profit was subject to a prospective adjustment after the first two years based on each entity&#8217;s actual investment of time and resources into the Asset Pool. There had been no adjustment to the Agreement from its inception to the present time and disposition.. The Agreement did not preclude the Company from selling its 60% ownership interest of Longmen Joint Venture.

&#160;

The parties to the Agreement established the Shaanxi Longmen Iron and Steel Unified Management Supervisory Committee (&#34;Supervisory Committee&#34;) to ensure that the facilities and related resources are operated and managed according to the stipulations set forth in the Agreement. The Board of Directors of Longmen Joint Venture, of which we held 4 out of 7 seats, required a simple majority vote and remains the controlling decision-making body of Longmen Joint Venture and the Asset Pool.

&#160;

The Agreement constituted an arrangement that involves a lease which meets certain of the criteria of a capital lease and therefore the assets constructed by Shaanxi Steel were accounted for by Longmen Joint Venture as a capital lease. The profit sharing liability portion of the lease obligation, representing 40% of the pre-tax profit generated by the Asset Pool, was accounted for by Longmen Joint Venture as a derivative financial instrument at fair value.

&#160;

Due to recurring losses and the deterioration of steel industry conditions, management impaired the fair value of Longmen Joint Venture&#8217;s long-lived assets in the second quarter of 2015, and an impairment charge of approximately $974 million was recorded (Also see critical accounting policies &#8211; impairment of long-lived assets below).

&#160;

On December 30, 2015, we sold our equity interest in General Steel (China) Co., Ltd, which included our variable interest entity, Longmen Joint Venture, to Victory Energy Resource Limited, a HK registered company indirectly-owned by Henry Yu, the Company's Chairman, a related party for $1million.

&#160;

Maoming Hengda Steel Co., Ltd 

&#160;

On June 25, 2008, through our subsidiary Qiu Steel, we paid approximately $7.1 million (RMB 50 million) in cash to purchase 99% of Maoming Hengda Steel Group, Ltd. (&#8220;Maoming Hengda&#8221;). The total registered capital of Maoming Hengda is approximately $77.8 million (RMB 544.6 million)

&#160;

Maoming Hengda&#8217;s core business was the production of rebar products used in the construction industry. Located on 140 hectares (approximately 346 acres) in Maoming city, Guangdong Province, the Maoming Hengda facility previously had two production lines capable of annual production capacities of 1.8 million metric tons of 5.5mm to 16mm diameter high-speed wire and 12mm to 38mm diameter rebar. The products were sold through nine distributors that targeted customers in Guangxi Province and the western region of Guangdong. To take advantage of a stronger market demand in Shaanxi Province, between 2009 and 2010, we relocated the 1.8 million metric ton capacity rebar production line and high-speed wire production line from Maoming Hengda's facility to Longmen Joint Venture.

&#160;

In December 2010, we brought online a new 400,000 ton capacity rebar production line. On December 15, 2013, Maoming Hengda entered into a lease agreement with Zhongshan Baohua Rebar Factory, with which Maoming Hengda leased the 400,000 ton capacity rebar production line and various other buildings and equipment to Zhongshan Baohua Rebar Factory, for an annual payment of $1.2 million (RMB 7.2 million) for eight years between March 2014 and February 2022.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Management evaluates the fair value of Maoming Hengda&#8217;s long-lived assets on an annual basis, or upon a triggering event which would require an assessment sooner. As of December 31, 2015, Management is of the opinion that the fair value of the property, plant and equipment exceeded their current carrying value based on a third-party valuation.

&#160;

On March 21, 2016, we sold our equity interest in Maoming Hengda to Tianwu Tongyong (Tianjin) International Trade Co., Ltd, (&#34;Tianwu Tongyong&#34;), for which the Company already had 32% equity interest in, for RMB 328.0 million in cash or approximately $50.5 million and with this transaction completed the full divestiture of our steel manufacturing and distribution business was completed.

&#160;

Tongyong Shengyuan (Tianjin) Technology Development Co., Ltd 

&#160; 

We established a subsidiary wholly owned by General Steel Investment Co., Ltd., Tongyong Shengyuan (Tianjin) Technology Development Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tongyong Shengyuan&#8221;) in June 2015. Tongyong Shengyuan is still in the development stage and has no revenues or significant operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as through the reporting date of this Form 10K.

&#160; 

Catalon Chemical Corp. 

&#160;

In October 2015, we acquired an 84.5% equity interest in Catalon Chemical Corp. (&#8220;Catalon&#8221;), a Delaware corporation headquartered in Virginia that develops and manufactures De-NOx honeycomb catalysts and industrial ceramics. Prior to December 31, 2015, we became aware of some operational issues related to Catalon. It was determined that such issues might have affected Catalon&#8217;s prior operations as well as its ability to conduct business in the future. As such, we are expected to cancel the shares issued to the 84.5% original owners of Catalon in accordance with the terms of the agreement at the end of 2016. Because we have decided to dispose of Catalon in the near future, we are presenting Catalon&#8217;s remaining assets, after impairment charges, and liabilities as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 in the consolidated financial statements. See Note 21 in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

Annual Production Capacity (metric tons) &#160; General Steel (China) (1) &#160; &#160; Longmen Joint Venture &#160; Maoming Hengda (1) &#160; Crude Steel &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; 7 million &#160; &#160; - &#160; Processing &#160; &#160; 400,000 &#160; &#160; 5 million &#160; &#160; 400,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Main Products &#160; &#160; Hot-rolled sheet &#160; &#160; Rebar/High-speed wire &#160; &#160; Rebar &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Main Application &#160; &#160; Light Agricultural vehicles &#160; &#160; Infrastructure and construction &#160; &#160; Infrastructure and construction &#160; &#160;

&#160; (1) The production facilities of General Steel (China) and Maoming Hengda were leased to unrelated parties through the respective disposition dates. &#160; 

Marketing and Customers 

&#160; 

We sell our products primarily to distributors and related parties, and we typically collect payment from these distributors in advance. Our marketing efforts are mainly directed toward those customers who have demanding requirements for on-time delivery, timeliness of customer services, and product quality. We believe that these requirements, as well as product planning, are critical factors in our ability to serve this segment of the market.

&#160;

Our revenue is dependent, in large part, on significant contracts with a limited number of large customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 15.1% of our sales were to one customer from our disposed operations. We believe that revenue derived from our current customers of our trading business will represent a significant portion of our total revenue going forward.

&#160;

Moreover, our success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers, as well as the financial condition and success of our customers and general economic conditions in China.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Demand for our Products 

&#160;

We anticipate consistent demand for our products driven by the China construction and infrastructure projects despite pricing challenges under the current industry climate. We believe there will be sustained regional demand for several years as both the central and provincial governments continue to drive western region development efforts through our trading business customer.

&#160;

Supply of Raw Materials 

&#160;

After our restructuring, our remaining businesses primarily trade iron ore, nickel-iron-manganese alloys, and other steel-related products. We do not anticipate any shortage on these products.

&#160; 

Industry Environment 

&#160;

Despite the growth in demand experienced throughout the past years, the overall nationwide steelmaking capacity still exceeds steel demand. There is significant over-capacity in the Chinese steel sector which is putting pressure on operators&#8217; profitability and has become the most significant challenge in the steel manufacturing business. Chinese crude steel production reached a record high of 823 million tons in 2014, an increase of 0.89% over 2013, while the total consumption of crude steel was only 738 million tons in 2014, a decrease of 3.4% from the same period last year, according to the China Iron and Steel Association.

&#160;

For steelmakers, operating performance depends on the volatility of the cost of raw materials. The shortage of these raw materials in the market has allowed suppliers of iron ore and metallurgical coal to rebuild the pricing mechanisms by shifting from annual to shorter-term price contracts. This has created numerous challenges for steelmakers as they must now deal with volatility in raw material prices, as well as maintain margins with fluctuating demand. Over the past few years, we have witnessed perseverance in steel prices that has given iron ore producers an opportunity to increase the prices in the next contract; however the reverse may not be true as steel companies cannot always pass on the rise in iron ore prices to end consumers due to the market overcapacity.

&#160;

China&#8217;s steel industry is highly fragmented, and the Chinese government continues to encourage industry consolidation. The Chinese central government has had a long-stated goal to consolidate 60% of domestic steel production among the top ten producers by 2015, and expanding to 70% by 2020. The top ten producers&#8217; output fell to 39% of the national output in 2013 from 49% in 2010, which is still below the 60% target for 2015 set in the 12 th year plan.

&#160;

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China is targeting to reduce up to 80 million metric tons of capacity by the end of 2018. In April 2012, the central government announced its goal of reducing obsolete iron and steel capacities by 17.8 million tons in 2012 and successfully reached the goal and eliminated 20.2 million tons of obsolete iron and steel capacity. In April 2013, the central government published the industry target of eliminating 10.4 million tons of obsolete iron and steel capacities in 2013 and successfully eliminated 16.9 million tons of obsolete iron and steel capacity. In May 2014, the government reaffirmed its determination of industry consolidation, and announced that it plans to eliminate 28.7 million tons of obsolete iron and steel capacity in 2014 and successfully eliminated 31.1 million tons, which was more than the original target amount. Such industry consolidation through the reduction of obsolete iron and steel capacities are not expected to directly impact our Company because we continue to see a strong demand for our products, especially in Western China, and believe there are significant growth opportunities in the industry.

&#160;

Despite the government&#8217;s initiatives to encourage industry consolidation and cut over-capacity, it is estimated that new capacity of approximately 20~25 million metric tons was added in 2014. Excess supply, weakening economic growth, and sagging prices have resulted in depressed margins and operating losses. According to statistics by China Iron and Steel Association, the blended net margin of China steel enterprises in 2014 was only 0.85%, with approximately 15% of major steel companies monitored by China Iron and Steel Association still incurring operating losses.

&#160;

On July 12, 2010, the Ministry of Industry &#38; Information Technology enacted the Steel Industry Admittance and Operation Qualifications standards. The new standards specify requirements for all aspects of steel production in China, which include: size of blast furnaces, size of converters, emission of waste water, dust per ton from steel production, quantity of coal used for each process in steel production and output capacity. According to the new standards, blast furnaces under 450 cubic meters are targeted to be eliminated. These standards once again confirmed the central government&#8217;s determination to push forward the consolidation of this fragmented industry.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Since 2013, the government has exerted a more stringent environment protection policy on the steel industry. In January 2014, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China (the &#34;MIIT&#34;) announced a List of Enterprises Fulfilling the Iron and Steel Industry Specification (the &#34;List&#34;). The List includes a highly-selected group of large and medium steel manufacturers that have met or exceeded more stringent national requirements and standards on product quality, environmental protection, energy consumption, workmanship and equipment, production scale, as well as work safety and social responsibility. The MIIT will collaborate with China's other governmental agencies to provide support to the List's members and to speed up the steel industry's restructuring and consolidation. Steel makers omitted from the List will most likely face higher electricity costs, more restrictive administrative measures, and adverse effects of forceful regulations intent on reducing the nation's overcapacity. Longmen Joint Venture, which was our major facility, is included on the List as one of the key steel enterprises in China&#8217;s Shaanxi Province.
