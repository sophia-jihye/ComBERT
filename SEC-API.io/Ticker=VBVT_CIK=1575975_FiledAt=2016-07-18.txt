&#160;

Corporate Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the state of Nevada on September 14, 2009. From inception until early 2015, we were engaged in the mineral exploration business. 

&#160;

During early 2015, we decided to abandon our mineral exploration properties and on February 27, 2015, we entered into a letter of intent with Ocure Ltd. ( "Ocure" ), pursuant to which we agreed to exclusively license certain technology from Ocure related to the development of products and devices for the treatment of anal fissures under terms of a license agreement to be negotiated between us and Ocure.

&#160;

On July 9, 2015, 2015 we incorporated Madison-IL Ltd. as our wholly-owned subsidiary under the laws of Israel. 

&#160;

On August 5, 2015, as amended on February 25, 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the "License Agreement" ) with Ocure, an Israeli corporation with a principal address at High-Tech Village, Givat Ram Campus, Hebrew University, P.O. Box 39158, Jerusalem 91391, Israel, and Madison-IL Ltd. (the "Subsidiary" ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated in Israel. Pursuant to the License Agreement, Ocure granted to the Subsidiary an exclusive, sub-licensable, worldwide, license (the "License" ) to Ocure's semi-occlusive wound dressing for ambulatory treatment of acute and chronic anal fissure, pursuant to Ocure's patents and patent applications (the "Licensed Technology" ) and to its production, use, import, offer for sale, sell, lease, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the Licensed Technology for uses classified as medical devices, or those otherwise approved ultimately as an OTC (over-the-counter) remedy. 

&#160;

As consideration for the License, we agreed to provide the initial round of $250,000 to the Subsidiary for commercialization of the technology, payable as follows: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

$10,000 (paid to Ocure at the signing of the letter of intent dated February 27, 2015);

&#160;

&#183; 

$90,000 at the later of May 11, 2015 or the final signing date of the License Agreement (the "Effective Date") (paid);

&#160;

&#183; 

$50,000 on or before March 4, 2016 (paid); and

&#160;

&#183; 

$100,000 on or before April 8, 2016 (paid $90,000).

&#160;

In addition, we agreed to make the second round of an additional $250,000 available to the Subsidiary, provided that Ocure has delivered on its applicable commitments and milestones as set out in the License Agreement, the License will and have continued to be held in force, and that at such time and date, ownership and right to any additional assets (not including the Licensed Technology) then existing in Ocure will be fully transferred to the Subsidiary. The second round will be payable as follows:

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

$100,000 on or before August 12, 2016;

&#160;

&#183; 

$100,000 on or before September 23, 2016; and

&#160;

&#183; 

$50,000 on or before October 28, 2016.

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; &#160; &#160; In the event that Ocure does not deliver on its applicable commitments and milestones for us to invest the second round payment to the Subsidiary, and we elect not to pay the second round payment, the License Agreement and the License will be terminated.

&#160;

In consideration of the License for the Licensed Technology and with respect to any inventions, improvement, development or enhancement based upon, consists of, comprises, contains or incorporates the Licensed Technology invented following the Effective Date by the Subisdiary, its affiliate or sublicensee (the "New Inventions" ), we agreed that the Subsidiary will pay to Ocure royalties calculated as 5% of gross sales attributable to the Subsidiary and the Subsidiary's sublicenses. In addition, we agreed that the Subsidiary will promptly pay to Ocure 20% of any cash or non-cash consideration received, whether for sublicense initiation fee, annual fee, sublicense milestone payments, or other such non-sale based royalty consideration payable by a sublicense as consideration for or under a sublicense.

&#160;

Under the License Agreement, the shareholders of Ocure and certain individuals designated by Ocure were to have opportunity to purchase and acquire an equity stake in our company that will equate to a collective ownership stake of up to 1,775,000 pre-split shares of our common stock at the par value purchase price of $0.001 per share. This right has expired but the parties intend to extend this right. In addition, we agreed to establish an incentive stock option plan reserving up to 20% of our issued share capital.

&#160;

The License Agreement provides that the Subsidiary will pay a monthly overhead fee to Van Leer Technology Ventures Jerusalem Ltd., in the amount of $1,000 per month plus VAT, for office overhead services.

&#160;

The License Agreement provides that the parties will agree upon the terms according to which certain principals of Ocure will, on or before any portion of the second round payment is paid, enter into consulting and service agreements with the Subsidiary. The License Agreement provides that the consulting and service agreements will contain escrow release provisions and repurchase rights to govern the common shares issuable to the principals (10% to be released 30 days from the date of the second round payment with 10% being released every 90 days thereafter). 

&#160;

Following the consummation of the second round payment, we agreed to establish a board of directors consisting of five individuals (three representatives on behalf of Ocure and two representatives on behalf of our company) and procure director &#38; officer liability insurance. 

&#160;

The closing of the License Agreement was subject to certain conditions, including:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Ocure providing us with certain materials relating to the budgets and milestones to be met by Ocure;

&#160;

&#183; 

Obtaining all corporate and/or third party approvals required;

&#160;

&#183; 

Obtaining the approval of the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of the Economy (the "OCS") to Ocure's performance of the License Agreement; and

&#160;

&#183; 

Our paying $90,000, the second tranche of the initial round of payment.

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

&#160;

The License Agreement will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the later of: (a) the date of expiration of the last to expire of Ocure's rights in Ocure patents in such country or such other grant of statutory exclusivity, or (b) the end of a period of 15 years from the date of making the First Commercial Sale in such country; unless sooner terminated pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement. Should an Ocure patent expire prior to 15 years from the date of the First Commercial Sale in a particular country or countries, the License in that country or those countries will be deemed a License to the know-how and/or any other intellectual property rights which are not patents and are deemed part of the Licensed Technology. Thereafter, the Subsidiary will have an irrevocable option to obtain an exclusive license to the Licensed Technology by agreeing to pay Ocure 50% of the royalty and non-sale based sublicense consideration. A " First Commercial Sale" means the first sale of a product whose manufacture, use or sale is covered by the Licensed Technology and receipt of the sale proceeds by the Subsidiary, its affiliate or a sublicensee after receipt of all governmental and other regulatory approvals required to market and sell such product have been obtained in the country in which such product is sold.

&#160;

The Subsidiary at its option, may terminate the License Agreement at any time by giving 90 days prior written notice to Ocure of the Subsidiary's intent to terminate.

&#160;

Ocure, at its option, may terminate the License Agreement as follows:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Upon the Subsidiary's failure to cure a monetary breach of more than $10,000 within 90 days after receiving written notice of such breach from Ocure; or

&#160;

&#183; 

Upon the Subsidiary's failure to cure a breach of a material term (other than a monetary breach) within 180 days after receiving written notice of such breach from Ocure; or

&#160;

&#183; 

If an examination by Ocure's accountant shows an underreporting or underpayment by the Subsidiary in excess of 20% for any 12 month period; or

&#160;

&#183; 

If the Subsidiary provides any false report, which has not been corrected within 60 days after written notice by Ocure or within 60 days after the Subsidiary becomes aware that false information has been provided, whichever occurs earlier.

&#160;

In addition, if our company or the Subsidary passes a resolution for voluntary winding up or a winding up application is made against it and not set aside within 60 days, or if a receiver or liquidator is appointed and has not been removed within 60 days, or enters into winding up or insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings which have not been set aside within 60 days, all duties of Ocure and all rights (but not duties) of the Subsidiary under the License Agreement will immediately terminate without the necessity of any action being taken by Ocure or by the Subsidiary; and in addition, upon the Subsidiary passing a resolution to wind up, Ocure, at its option, may terminate the License Agreement immediately upon written notice to the Subsidiary. 

&#160;

On November 12, 2015, Ocure received the approval by the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of the Economy of Ocure's performance of the License Agreement, which approval was the condition precedent to the respective obligations of each party to the License Agreement. Accordingly, the Effective Date of the License Agreement is November 12, 2015.

&#160;

Effective April 11, 2016, we effected a four for one forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, our authorized common stock has increased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share, and the number of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock has increased from 7,100,000 to 28,400,000.

&#160;

Our Current Business 

&#160;

On August 5, 2015, as amended February 25, 2016, our company and Madison-IL Ltd. entered into an exclusive license agreement with Ocure to license Ocure's semi-occlusive wound dressing for ambulatory treatment of acute and chronic anal fissure, pursuant to Ocure's patents and patent applications and to its production, use, import, offer for sale, sell, lease, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the Licensed Technology for uses classified as medical devices, or those otherwise approved ultimately as an OTC (over-the-counter) remedy.

&#160;

With this licensing we are focusing our efforts on the development of products for the treatment of anal fissures. We abandoned our efforts in the mineral exploration industry. 

&#160;

Based on the licensed technology, we intend to develop and produce propriety devices that present a novel approach for treating anal fissures that is safe and simple to use by patients with minimal discomfort. 

&#160;

The device that we intend to develop and market is a flexible medical foam wrapped with semi- occlusive wound dressing serving as a physical barrier to cover the anal fissure and maintain a moist physiological environment at the fissure lesion to provide optimal healing conditions. The rationale for our proposed device is that preserving the moist physiological environment in the injured lesion prevents fissure drying, promotes re-epithelialization and reduces the local pain in the rectum. This allows relieve of the anal spasm and accelerates the healing of the fissure wound. Insertion of the device is done with a specifically designed applicator to allow easy and accurate placement of the device in the anal canal. The device is intended to stay in the anal canal up to 24 hours. The device naturally exits the anal canal during bowel movement or is replaced manually after 12 hours. The device is intended for one-time use and is provided in a kit with a set of ten semi-occlusive wound dressings for 10-day treatment. 

&#160;

Since entering into the License Agreement, we have developed the devices and started the manufacturing process, based on past drawing and design we had from the past Ocure production, with some variations to accommodate changes in the raw materials. New mold for the applicator was designed and the test injection production passed successfully.

&#160;

Our activities in Israel are focused on advancement of clinical studies and production of product for use in clinical studies. The clinical studies are being carried out at the Wolfson Medical Centre in Israel and in the Hospital Sagrat Cor in Barcelona, Spain.

&#160;

In the regulatory arena, we approached the Ministry of Health in Israel, and we expect to receive the Helsinki approval to start treating patients in Wolfson Hospital in Israel. If we receive the approval, we plan to treat 25 patients during the coming four months. Moreover, we have an agreement with Hospital Sagrat Cor, a medical centre in Barcelona, Spain, to treat additional 25 patients. With these two centers, we believe we will be able to approach distribution channels in Israel and Europe to market these devices.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

Following completion of clinical approval, we intend to distribute our products mainly through distributors worldwide.

Market 

&#160;

Anal fissure represents a widespread anorectal problem encountered in the clinical practice and in non-clinical settings. Chronic anal fissures can occur in all age groups, though it is more common in young healthy adults. Annually, over four million people in the United States suffer from anal fissures. Based on current available treatments, about 750,000 patients are clinically treated in the United States. It is approximated that anal fissure represents 6% to 15% of all visits in colorectal units. Today, pharmacological treatments for anal fissure suffer from limited efficacy, side effects, high recurrences and patient dissatisfaction, while surgery treatment is more effective but causes irreversible damage to the anal muscles and carries a risk of fecal incontinence. We believe that currently, there is a significant medical need for a safe, non-invasive and effective treatment that will help to minimize pain, promote the healing of the fissure and reduce treatment duration. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We believe that our proposed devices present a novel approach for treating anal fissures that are safe and simple to use by patients with minimal discomfort. The alternative treatments of anal fissure are based on drugs and surgical procedures. 

&#160;

The conventional therapies are: 

&#160;

Glyceryl trinitrate (Rectogesic): Side effects include severe headaches, blood pressure changes. Success rate is low and there is a slow healing process, if at all, of 6 to 8 weeks. The recurrence rate is as high as 50%. This is an off-label use of the drug administered, which is used twice a day. 

&#160;

Calcium channels blockers suffer from similar issues such as slow healing rates of 6 to 8 weeks, low success rate a recurrence rate of 40 to 60%. Drug administration is four times daily. 

&#160;

Botulinum toxin is expensive costing over $500 per shot. The recurrence rate is high at 40-55%. It is invasive and there is risk of temporary incontinence as well as the risk of abscess development. 

&#160;

The healing rate of medical therapy is only 40 - 60%, there are no approved treatments for anal fissure in the United States, and there is lack in industrial manufacturing of Nifedipine ointment in Europe. 

&#160;

Surgical procedures: Between 20% to 30% of chronic patients undergo an operation. There are over 100,000 operations conducted annually in the United States. Most anal fissure surgeries are performed in private clinics. 

&#160;

Research and Development Expenditures 

&#160;

We did not incur expenditures in research and development activities over the last two fiscal years. We intend to dedicate some of our capital to research and development in order to establish product sales in the foreseeable future.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have no employees other than our sole director and officer. The company has 4 consultants who perform the duties required of the company. Amos Bar-Shalev is the CEO, and provides management services. Vered Caplan provides business development services, including fundraising and co-operative ventures with other medical companies. Ze'ev Cohen is in charge of Research and Development and production. Miri Sani is managing director, clinical studies and regulatory affairs. We also may engage experts in medical device industry and in general business to advise us in various capacities.

European Patent Application No. 11770171.4 Filed August 25, 2011 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

U.S. Patent Application No. 13/818,692 Filed August 25, 2011

&#160;

The first patent describes the entire concept of the use of the device, while the second patent focuses on the unique design developed by Ocure. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the License Agreement, Ocure granted to the Subsidiary an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide, license to Ocure's semi-occlusive wound dressing for ambulatory treatment of acute and chronic anal fissure, pursuant to Ocure's patents and patent applications listed above and to its production, use, import, offer for sale, sell, lease, distribute, or otherwise commercialize the licensed technology for uses classified as medical devices, or those otherwise approved ultimately as an OTC (over-the-counter) remedy. 

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

We anticipate that our products and operations will be subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( "FDA" ) and countries or regions in which we market our products. 

&#160;

United States 

&#160;

The FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, marketing, distribution, and service of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets and the importation of medical devices manufactured abroad. 

&#160;

Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a pre-market approval ( "PMA" ) application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 

&#160;

&#160; 9 

&#160; 

&#160;

Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. 

&#160;

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. 

&#160;

Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is "substantially equivalent," as defined in the statute, to either: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or

&#160;

&#183; 

another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process.

&#160;

To be "substantially equivalent," the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. 

&#160;

After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device. 

&#160;

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer's determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer's determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements. 

&#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160; 

&#160;

If the FDA determines that the device is not "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Pursuant to amendments to the statute in 2012, a manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. We expect that our proposed device will be classified as Class II device and intend to submit a petition for direct de novo review for our proposed device. 

&#160;

Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA's satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA's satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. 

&#160;

In addition, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission ( "FTC" ) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. Many regulatory jurisdictions outside of the United States have similar regulations to which we are subject.

&#160;

Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practice ( "GMP" ) requirements contained in its Quality System Regulation ( "QSR" ) and associated regulations and guidance. The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records which demonstrate compliance with FDA regulation, the manufacturer's own procedures, specifications and testing as well as distribution and postmarket experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new products and is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the United States. A company's facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA, which may issue reports known as Forms FDA 483 or Notices of Inspectional Observations which list instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, or Untitled Letters, which are notices of intended enforcement actions against the manufacturer. If a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter is not addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of any other serious issue with a manufacturer's products or facilities, it could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, total shutdown of production facilities, prohibition on export or import and criminal prosecution. Such actions may have further indirect consequences for the manufacturer outside of the United States, and may adversely affect the reputation of the manufacturer and the product. In the United States, routine FDA inspections usually occur every two years, and may occur more often for cause. 

&#160;

&#160; 11 

&#160;

To a greater or lesser extent, most other countries require some form of quality system and regulatory compliance, which may include periodic inspections, inspections by third party auditors, and specialized documentation. Failure to meet all the requirements of these countries could jeopardize our ability to import, market, support and receive reimbursement for the use of our products in these countries. 

&#160;

In addition to the above, we may seek to conduct clinical research on products that have not yet been cleared or approved for particular indications in clinical studies or trials in the United States or other countries. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board ( "IRB" ). Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot assure that access to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary. 

&#160;

Products manufactured outside the United States by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the United States. We must demonstrate compliance of such products to U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays. 

&#160;

Foreign Regulation 

&#160;

In order for us to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes which are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in a timely manner and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines. 

&#160;

Commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union ( "EU" ). Similar to the U.S., the EU recognizes different class of medical devices. The EU recognizes Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb or Class III medical devices, with the classification determination depending on the amount of potential risk to the patient associated with use of the medical device. Classification involves rules found in the EU's Medical Device Directive. Key questions of relevance include the degree of the device's contact with the patient, invasiveness, active nature, and indications for use. The medical device classes recognized in the EU are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Class I, which are considered low risk devices, such as wheelchairs and stethoscopes, and require pre-market notification prior to placing the devices onto the EU market;

&#160;

&#183; 

Class IIa, which are considered low-medium risk devices and require certification by a Notified Body (which is a private commercial entity designated by the national government of an EU member state as being competent to make independent judgments about whether a medical device complies with applicable regulatory requirements);

&#160;

&#183; 

Class IIb, which are considered medium-high risk devices and require certification by a Notified Body; and

&#160;

&#183; 

Class III, which are considered high-risk devices and require certification by a Notified Body.

&#160;

&#160; 12 

&#160; 

&#160;

We anticipate that our proposed device would be classified as a Class IIa medical device based on the EU's medical device classes. 

&#160;

The EU presently requires that all medical products bear the Conformit Europ enne ( "CE" ) mark, for compliance with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) as amended. The CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain essential principles of safety and performance mandated in applicable European medical device directives, which once affixed, enables a product to be sold in member countries of the EU and those affiliated which accept the CE mark. The CE mark is also recognized in many countries outside of the EU, such as Australia, and can assist in the clearance process. In order to affix the CE mark on products, a recognized European Notified Body must certify a manufacturer's quality system and design dossier for compliance with international and European requirements. 

&#160;

If we modify our existing products or develop new products in the future, we may need to apply for authorization to affix the CE mark to such products. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain authorization to affix the CE mark for new or modified products or whether we will continue to meet the safety and performance standards required to maintain the authorizations we have already received. If we are unable to maintain authorizations to affix the CE mark to our products, we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the EU or those whose marketing authorizations are based on the CE Mark. 

&#160;

Regulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries have their own regulatory agencies. These regulations typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. In addition, local regulations may apply which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and in general are increasing in complexity, and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions, fines and prevent us from marketing our products in these regions.

&#160;

Other Healthcare Laws 

&#160;

We may also be subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws and regulations. If our operations are found to violate any of the laws described above or any other laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to market our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business.
