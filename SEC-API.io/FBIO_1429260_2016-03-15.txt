 Item 1. Business. &#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Since inception on June 28, 2006, Fortress Biotech, Inc. (&#8220;Fortress&#8221;), formerly Coronado Biosciences, Inc., has been a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development of novel immunotherapy agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. In 2015, as part of our growth strategy, we focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing novel pharmaceutical and biotechnology products. We plan to continue to develop and commercialize products both within Fortress and our subsidiaries, which are sometimes referred to herein as the &#8220;Fortress Companies&#8221;. In addition to our internal development programs, we plan to leverage our biopharmaceutical business expertise and drug development capabilities to help the Fortress Companies innovate, develop and commercialize products. Additionally, we will provide funding and management services to each of the Fortress Companies and, from time to time, we and the Fortress Companies will seek licensing, partnerships, joint ventures and/or public and private financings to accelerate and provide additional funding to support their research and development programs.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our business approach is designed for maximum flexibility, allowing us to invest in a broad array of new technologies with clinical and commercial potential. It enables us to move quickly to take advantage of time-sensitive opportunities when necessary, and provides us with a range of options that allow us to select what we believe is the most advantageous corporate or financial structure for each investment candidate. We seek to acquire and invest in drugs, technologies and operating subsidiaries with high growth potential. In 2015, we made significant progress with our above initiatives and believe our novel business approach will provide opportunities to achieve synergies across multiple Fortress Companies.

&#160;

At the end of 2015, we had several consolidated Fortress Companies, some of which contain product licenses, including Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Avenue&#8221;), Journey Medical Corporation (&#8220;JMC&#8221;), Coronado SO Co. (&#8220;Coronado SO&#8221;), Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Checkpoint&#8221;), Mustang Bio, Inc. (&#8220;Mustang&#8221;), Helocyte, Inc. (&#8220;Helocyte&#8221;), formerly DiaVax Biosciences, Inc. (&#8220;DiaVax&#8221;),Escala Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Escala&#8221;), formerly Altamira Biosciences, Inc. (&#8220;Altamira&#8221;), CB Securities Corporation and Cyprium, Inc.

&#160;

Coronado SO was formed in March 2014 as an oncology subsidiary. In January 2015, Coronado SO entered into an exclusive license agreement with a third party for a license for a Phase 2, Uracil Topical Cream used in the treatment and prevention of hand-foot syndrome, a common painful side effect of chemotherapeutics. In June 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) accepted specific components of a planned Phase 2 study. Coronado SO is a Delaware corporation and is a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.

&#160; 

Escala Therapeutics, Inc. 

&#160;

Escala, formerly Altamira, was formed in December 2013 as a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel agents for the treatment of rare, neglected or orphan disorders. Escala aims to acquire rights to such products by licensing or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in the products, accelerate product-related research and development through funding and eventually provide these products to patients.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Currently, Escala is developing N-acetyl-D-mannosamine monohydrate (&#8220;ManNAc&#8221;), for the treatment of GNE Myopathy (also known as Human Inclusion Body Myopathy, or HIBM), and other disorders. in partnership with the National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;). In July 2015, Escala acquired the NIH&#8217;s license and cooperative research and development agreements (&#8220;CRADAs&#8221;) from New Zealand Pharmaceuticals Limited (&#8220;NZP&#8221;). NZP will continue to manufacture ManNAc and remain the exclusive global supplier of ManNAc to Escala.

&#160;

ManNAc is currently under investigation in an open label Phase 2 clinical study for the treatment of GNE Myopathy. A Phase I study to further investigate ManNAc safety and tolerability in a range of kidney disorders (glomerular nephropathies) associated with hyposialylation is under Internal Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) review. Escala is a Delaware corporation and a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.

&#160; 

Product Candidates held by Fortress 

&#160; 

Fortress&#8217; sole product candidate is CNDO-109, a lysate (disrupted CTV-1 cells, cell membrane fragments, cell proteins and other cellular components) that activates donor Natural Killer (&#8220;NK&#8221;) cells. CTV-1 is a leukemic cell line re-classified as a T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (&#8220;ALL&#8221;). In November 2007, we entered into a license agreement, since amended, with University College London Business PLC (&#8220;UCLB&#8221;) under which we received an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize CNDO-109 to activate NK cells for the treatment of cancer-related and other conditions and a non-exclusive license to certain clinical data solely for use in the IND for CNDO-109. In consideration of the license from UCLB, we will be required to make future milestone payments totaling up to approximately $22 million contingent upon the achievement of various regulatory milestones and, in the event that CNDO-109 is commercialized, we may be obligated to pay to UCLB royalties ranging from 3% to 5% of net sales of the product or, if commercialized by a sublicensee, a percentage of certain consideration we receive from such sublicensee (ranging from 20%-30% of such consideration depending on the stage of clinical development at the time of the sublicense). The manufacturing process for CNDO-109 activated NK cells is currently under development. We have produced a master cell bank and a working cell bank of CTV-1 cells in collaboration with BioReliance Corp, and we have contracted with Progenitor Cell Therapy, LLC and WuXi AppTec for services related to development, manufacture and testing services. We are sponsoring an ongoing Phase 1/2 study in patients with AML who are in their first complete remission (&#8220;CR1&#8221;) and who are at a high risk of relapsing. This study has completed enrollment and is expected to remain open to follow the status of patients until mid-2016.

&#160; 

In April 2015, we decided to no longer pursue the development of our Trichuris suis ova (&#8220;TSO&#8221;). A preliminary analysis of data in our Phase 2A clinical trial of TSO in pediatric patients with autism disorder failed to demonstrate any signal of activity.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our and, in some cases, our subsidiaries&#8217; product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our and, in some cases, our subsidiaries&#8217; product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.

&#160;

We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our and our subsidiaries&#8217; management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisers, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we and our subsidiaries currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we and our subsidiaries require all of our employees, consultants, advisers and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.

&#160;

With respect to CNDO-109, we have exclusive rights to International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2006/000960 and all pending United States and foreign counterpart applications including granted U.S. Patents No. 8,257,970 and 8,637,308 and the corresponding national phase applications granted in Australia and India and filed in Canada, Europe and Japan, directed to the stimulation of NK cells and related CNDO-109 compositions and methods including methods for the treatment of cancer and other conditions. This patent family has been in-licensed on an exclusive basis from UCLB. The CNDO-109 patent has an expiration date of January 2029 in the absence of any patent term extension. By way of an amendment to the license agreement with UCLB, we also have exclusive rights to International Application No. PCT/GB2010/051135 and all pending United States and foreign counterpart applications including pending United States Patent Application Serial No. 12/833,694 and the corresponding national phase applications filed in Europe, Brazil, China, Israel, Singapore and South Africa, directed to the preservation of activated NK cells and related compositions and methods. The CNDO-109 patents that may issue from the former patent family would expire in July 2030 in the absence of any patent term extension. The amendment includes rights to certain additional confidential technologies as well.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

We and our subsidiaries operate in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our and our subsidiaries&#8217; competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with us and our subsidiaries. We and our subsidiaries also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

&#160;

Each cancer indication for which we or any of our subsidiaries may develop products has a number of established therapies with which our candidates will compete. With respect to CNDO-109, most major pharmaceutical companies and many biotechnology companies are aggressively pursuing new cancer development programs, including both therapies with traditional, as well as novel, mechanisms of action. Some of the anticipated competitor treatments for AML include Genzyme Corporation&#8217;s Clolar (clofarabine), currently approved as a treatment for ALL, Eisai Corporation&#8217;s Dacogen (decitabine), currently approved as a treatment for Myelodysplastic Syndromes (&#8220;MDS&#8221;), Celgene Corporation&#8217;s Vidaza (azacitidine), currently approved as treatments for MDS, and Sunesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8217;s vosaroxin and Ambit Bioscience, Inc.&#8217;s quizartinib, which are currently being developed as a treatment for AML, any or all of which could change the treatment paradigm of acute leukemia. Each of these compounds is further along in clinical development than is the CDNO&#8211;109 activated NK cell product.

&#160;

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160;

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we and our subsidiaries are developing.

&#160;

United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process 

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical (drug and biologic) products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product-development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to good laboratory practices (&#8220;GLPs&#8221;) or other applicable regulations; &#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Product Drug Application (&#8220;IND&#8221;), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; &#160; &#8226; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s current good clinical practices (&#8220;GCPs&#8221;), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use; &#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) or Biologic License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) for a new pharmaceutical product; &#160; &#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; &#160; &#8226; potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA/ BLA; and &#160; &#8226; FDA review and approval of the NDA/BLA. &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.

&#160;

Products for somatic cell therapy are derived from a variety of biologic sources, including directly harvested autologous, allogeneic, or cultured cell lines. Product safety requires that these sources be well characterized, uniform, and not contaminated with hazardous adventitious agents. Also, cells directly from humans pose additional product safety issues. Because of the complex nature of these products, a controlled, reproducible manufacturing process and facility are required and relied on to produce a uniform product. The degree of reliance on a controlled process varies depending on the nature of the product. Because complete chemical characterization of a biologic product is not feasible for quality control, the testing of the biologic potency receives particular attention and is costly.

&#160;

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trial.

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB or ethics committee if conducted outside of the United States, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. We intend to use third-party clinical research organizations (&#8220;CROs&#8221;) to administer and conduct our planned clinical trials and will rely upon such CROs, as well as medical institutions, clinical investigators and consultants, to conduct our trials in accordance with our clinical protocols and to play a significant role in the subsequent collection and analysis of data from these trials. The failure by any of such third parties to meet expected timelines, adhere to our protocols or meet regulatory standards could adversely impact the subject product development program. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is usually introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. &#160; &#8226; Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. &#160; &#8226; Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA/BLA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications. &#160;

Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be requested by the FDA as a condition of approval.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s or ethics committee&#8217;s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

&#160;

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

&#160; 

United States Review and Approval Processes 

&#160;

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA/BLA requesting approval to market the product.

&#160;

The NDA/BLA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA/BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA/BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we, our subsidiaries or our suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements.

&#160;

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160;

Any pharmaceutical products for which we or our subsidiaries receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties.

&#160;

The FDA also may require Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.

&#160;

Orphan Drugs 

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Requests for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the submission of an NDA or BLA. In June 2012, we were notified by the FDA that CNDO-109 was granted orphan drug designation and in September 2012, the Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;PTO&#8221;) issued the first U.S. patent covering CNDO-109. If CNDO-109 is commercialized, we will be obligated to pay UCLB annual royalties based upon the net sales of product or if we sublicense CNDO-109, a portion of sub-licensing revenue we receive, if any.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another person if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public&#8217;s need. If the FDA approves someone else&#8217;s application for the same drug that has orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could be prescribed by physicians outside its FDA approval for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or other uses.

&#160;

Pediatric Information 

&#160;

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs and BLAs or supplements to NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the treatment for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the treatment is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

&#160;

The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides BLA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a product if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA&#8217;s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within a specific time frame.

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

&#160;

In the United States, our and our subsidiaries&#8217; activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.

&#160;

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

&#160;

In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we and our subsidiaries receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation and regulations, including regulations that will be issued to implement provisions of the health care reform legislation enacted in 2010, known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act and further changes in the law or regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

International Regulation 

&#160;

In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
