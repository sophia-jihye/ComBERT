General Description of Our Business

We are a clinical&#8209;stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. We are developing our product candidates based on a simple notion: we believe that better cell therapies start with better cells. Our therapeutic approach, which we refer to as cell programming, utilizes pharmacologic modulators, such as small molecules, to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells ex vivo , or outside the body. These programmed cells are then adoptively transferred to patients as therapies. We believe that this highly-differentiated therapeutic paradigm &#8211; systematically and precisely programming the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells ex vivo prior to adoptive transfer &#8211; is an elegant, cost-effective and scalable approach for maximizing the safety and efficacy of cell therapies. Utilizing our cell programming approach, we program immune cells, such as CD34+ cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells and T cells.

We are advancing a pipeline of programmed cellular immunotherapies, including both donor-sourced and off-the-shelf, pluripotent cell-derived immune cell therapies, in the fields of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation. Our clinical program is ProTmune&#8482;, a programmed immuno-regulatory cell therapy consisting of donor-sourced mobilized peripheral blood cells which have been modulated using two small molecules, for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in immunocompromised patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Our preclinical programs include NK- and T-cell cancer immunotherapies, including off-the-shelf therapies derived from engineered induced pluripotent cells (denoted as an iNK Cell Therapy and an iT Cell Therapy, respectively), and a CD34+ cell immuno-regulatory therapy to suppress aberrant auto-reactive effector cells for autoimmune diseases. 

We also have entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. to identify and apply small molecule modulators to enhance the therapeutic function of genetically-engineered CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell and TCR (T-cell receptor) immunotherapies.

We were incorporated in Delaware in 2007, and are headquartered in San Diego, CA.

Our Cell Programming Approach

The use of human cells as therapeutic entities has disease&#8209;transforming potential, and compelling evidence of their medical benefit exists across a broad spectrum of severe, life&#8209;threatening diseases. One of the most successful and widespread applications of cell therapy is hematopoietic cell transplantation, or HCT, with over 60,000 procedures performed worldwide on an annual basis. HCT holds curative potential for patients afflicted with hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, and with rare genetic disorders, such as hemoglobinopathies, inherited metabolic disorders and immune deficiencies.

Building upon this well&#8209;established medical precedent, the clinical investigation of hematopoietic cells, including CD34+ cells, NK cells and T cells, as therapies for the treatment of human diseases is rapidly expanding. In fact, over 150 clinical trials using hematopoietic cells as therapeutic entities are currently being conducted. Many of these clinical trials are investigating transformative applications of hematopoietic cells, including for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, genetic disorders and immunological diseases. While advancements in the isolation, expansion and manufacture of hematopoietic cells have opened new avenues for their use as therapeutic entities, we believe hematopoietic cells can also be programmed to maximize therapeutic benefit. 

Since our founding, we have been dedicated to programming the biological properties and therapeutic function of immune cells ex vivo , and we believe immune cells can be systematically and precisely modulated outside the body to impart profound therapeutic effects inside the body upon their administration to a patient. Using advanced molecular characterization tools and technologies, we identify small molecule or biologic modulators that promote rapid and supra&#8209;physiologic activation or inhibition of therapeutically&#8209;relevant genes and cell&#8209;surface proteins, such as those involved in the homing, proliferation and survival of CD34+ cells or those involved in the persistence, proliferation and anti-tumor activity of T cells and NK cells. We apply our deep understanding of the hematopoietic system to rapidly assess and quantify the therapeutic benefit of programmed immune cells in vivo . Applying these capabilities in the settings of cancer and immune disorders, we aim to develop programmed cellular immunotherapies with disease&#8209;transforming potential.

Additionally, we have worked closely with our scientific founders to pioneer the derivation and differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, a potentially disruptive technology for engineering and programming the fate of cells ex vivo . iPSCs are pluripotent cells, which are generated through the expression of certain genes and factors, that have cellular and physiological traits similar to those of an embryonic stem cell. We believe our iPSC platform, which combines genetic engineering with rapid and efficient generation of immune cells, has the potential to create large quantities of homogeneous, engineered cell populations in the hematopoietic lineage, such as CD34+ cells, NK cells and T cells, which can otherwise be limited in quantity, difficult to manufacture, 

&#160;

heterogeneous in composition and unoptimized for efficacy. Specifically, our iPSC platform is designed to enable the generation of highly-stable, genetically-modified, c lonal pluripotent cell lines and to utilize these lines for the unlimited production of engineered CD34+ cells, NK cells and T cells without requiring patient-sourced cells. We believe our approach has the potential to overcome key limitations of patient-s ourced cell therapies , such as the requirement to source, isolate , engineer and expand cells for each individual patient, and may prove to be the cornerstone of off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapy. 

&#160;

Our Business Strategy

We seek to develop and commercialize programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders based on our cell programming approach. The key pillars of our strategy are to:

&#183; 

Efficiently develop and commercialize programmed cellular immunotherapies for the prevention of life-threatening complications in immunocompromised patients undergoing allogeneic HCT. 

Allogeneic HCT involves the adoptive transfer of donor-sourced hematopoietic cells to reconstitute the blood and immune system of an immunocompromised patient following receipt of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and other rare disorders. We believe donor-sourced hematopoietic cells administered to a patient can be programmed to maximize therapeutic benefit and more effectively enable the curative potential of allogeneic HCT. Using our cell programming approach, we modulate the biological properties and therapeutic function of donor-sourced hematopoietic cells ex vivo prior to adoptive transfer, and we are developing a programmed cellular immunotherapy for use as a hematopoietic cell graft for allogeneic HCT.

We believe the use of our programmed cellular immunotherapy as a hematopoietic cell graft for allogeneic HCT may significantly improve the procedure&#8217;s curative potential by preventing a multitude of life-threatening complications, including acute GvHD and severe infections, that currently contribute to high rates of patient morbidity and mortality. We are developing our immunotherapies to serve patients across a wide range of ages and a broad spectrum of hematologic malignancies. Due to the rare disease nature of our target indications and the high incidences of life-threatening complications, we believe clinical trials that we conduct will generally require relatively small numbers of subjects. Additionally, because HCT is a highly&#8209;specialized procedure performed at a limited number of centers, we intend to build our own sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize any immunotherapies that we may successfully develop in a cost&#8209;efficient manner.

&#183; 

Leverage our deep understanding of hematopoietic cell biology and our clinical and regulatory expertise in cell therapy to advance a pipeline of donor-sourced and off-the-shelf programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer and immune disorders. 

In developing a programmed cellular immunotherapy for use as a hematopoietic cell graft for allogeneic HCT, we have gained a deep understanding of and novel insights into the biological properties and therapeutic function of the key cell types that comprise a hematopoietic cell graft including CD34+ cells, NK cells and T cells. We have also built research, clinical and regulatory affairs teams that are experienced and skilled in the development of hematopoietic cell therapies. Additionally, we have complemented our internal efforts by forming collaborations with renowned scientists, top clinical investigators and prominent medical centers to accelerate the preclinical development and clinical translation. We seek to leverage these advantages to advance a portfolio of programmed hematopoietic cell therapies for cancer and immune disorders.

Most hematopoietic cell therapies under development today utilize hematopoietic cells sourced from patients and, therefore, share a number of features that may limit their therapeutic potential and commercial viability. For example, the overall safety and efficacy of these cell therapies may be limited by the inherent qualities, quantities and properties of the patient&#8217;s cells; the manufacture of these cell therapies in therapeutically-relevant amounts involves resource-intensive sourcing, culturing, activation and expansion of patient cells; the incorporation of multiple therapeutic mechanisms through genetic engineering may be restricted by the inherent nature of hematopoietic cells to become exhausted during manufacture; and the overall therapeutic paradigm, from cell sourcing to cell therapy manufacture to therapy delivery, is patient-specific. In collaboration with two of our scientific founders, Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and Dr. Sheng Ding of the Gladstone Institute at UCSF, we have built a proprietary, small molecule&#8209;enhanced iPSC platform. Our patent&#8209;protected iPSC platform enables the isolation, genetic&#8209;engineering, selection and characterization of pluripotent cells, at a single&#8209;cell level, for stable clonal expansion. We seek to utilize our iPSC platform to develop off-the-shelf, engineered NK- and T-cell cancer immunotherapies having multi-pronged therapeutic functionality and scalability, and which overcome many of the key limitations of patient-sourced cell therapies.

&#160;

&#183; 

Selectively share our cell programming expertise with industry-leading strategic partners for the development of highly-differentiated cellular immunotherapies. &#160;

Over 150 clinical trials using hematopoietic cells as therapeutic entities are currently being conducted, and hundreds of hematopoietic cell therapies are currently being advanced through preclinical development. We believe a tremendous opportunity exists to program the biological properties and therapeutic function of hematopoietic cells to create better cells and better cell therapies, and we seek to apply our expertise in hematopoietic cell biology and cell programming in collaboration with industry-leading companies and academic investigators engaged in the development of hematopoietic cell therapies. Through the establishment of collaborative arrangements, we seek to expand our ability to identify pharmacologic modulators, increase our understanding of the immune system and enable us to participate in the research and development of highly-differentiated cellular immunotherapies.

We believe we are uniquely positioned as an expert partner of choice for industry-leading developers seeking to maximize the therapeutic benefit of hematopoietic cell therapies through pharmacologic modulation. For example, we entered into a multi-year collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, Inc., or Juno, a leading developer of genetically-engineered CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies, in May 2015. Under the collaboration, we screen for and identify small molecule modulators that improve the function of T cells, including modulators that enhance the therapeutic properties of CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies. Juno has exclusive rights to incorporate such modulators in its development and commercialization of genetically-engineered CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies directed against certain tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno, and we have retained exclusive rights to such modulators for all other purposes. For each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, we are eligible to receive clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as low single-digit royalties on sales. We believe our collaboration with Juno has the potential to lead to the development and commercialization of multiple programmed CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies. 

Our Programed Cellular Immunotherapies

We are developing a highly-differentiated pipeline of programmed cellular immunotherapies based on a simple notion: we believe better cell therapies start with better cells. We believe that enhancing the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells ex vivo prior to adoptive transfer is an elegant, cost effective and scalable approach for maximizing the safety and efficacy of cell therapies. Utilizing our cell programming approach, we seek to program immune cells, including CD34+ cells, NK cells and T cells, and are advancing a pipeline of donor-sourced and off-the-shelf, pluripotent cell-derived immune cell therapies in the fields of immuno-oncology and immuno-regulation.

Programmed Cellular Immunotherapies for Allogeneic HCT

Allogeneic HCT is a well&#8209;established procedure that has been performed globally for decades with curative intent in patients with a wide range of hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders. The procedure involves transferring donor&#8209;sourced hematopoietic cells to a patient following the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The biological properties of the various cell populations present in the donor&#8209;sourced hematopoietic cell graft each play an essential role in determining outcomes of allogeneic HCT. Donor&#8209;sourced CD34+ cells have the unique ability to engraft and reconstitute a new blood and immune system, and donor&#8209;sourced immune cells, such as T cells, have an important protective role following HCT in eradicating residual cancer cells and providing protection against life&#8209;threatening infections. The engraftment of donor&#8209;sourced CD34+ cells is essential for successful reconstitution, and any delay in, or failure of, engraftment leaves a patient severely immuno&#8209;compromised and exposed to exceedingly high risk of early morbidity and mortality. Additionally, while the donor&#8209;sourced immune cells impart a critical immunotherapeutic effect, allo-reactive T cells can result in GvHD, a serious complication where donor&#8209;sourced T cells recognize antigens on a patient&#8217;s cells as foreign and attack the patient&#8217;s cells.

According to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, there are approximately 30,000 allogeneic HCT procedures performed globally each year. Hematopoietic cells for use in allogeneic HCT can be obtained from multiple donor sources including umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood (mPB). Approximately 65% of allogeneic HCT procedures utilize mPB as the donor hematopoietic cell source. While the use of mPB is associated with faster rates of neutrophil engraftment compared to other cell sources like bone marrow and umbilical cord blood, approximately 35-50% of patients undergoing mPB HCT develop acute GvHD and 70-80% of patients undergoing mPB HCT experience at least one severe infection, such as CMV infection, within the first 180 days following HCT. We believe our cell programming approach has the potential to prevent severe, life-threatening complications and improve outcomes in patients undergoing HCT.

ProTmune&#8482;. We are developing ProTmune as an investigational programmed cellular immunotherapy for use as an allogeneic HCT cell source. ProTmune is produced by modulating donor-sourced, human mPB ex vivo with two small molecules, 16,16-dimethyl 

&#160;

prostaglandin E2 (FT1050) and dexamethasone (FT4145) , t o enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of the hematopoietic cells. T he programmed mPB cells are adoptively transferred and administered to a patient as a one-time i ntravenous therapy . 

In January 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the Company's investigational new drug (IND) application for ProTmune. We plan to initiate a multi-center, randomized, controlled Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProTmune in adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing mPB HCT in mid-2016. The primary objectives of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial are to evaluate safety and tolerability, and to assess the potential of ProTmune to prevent acute GvHD and CMV infection, both of which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing HCT. There are currently no approved therapies for the prevention of GvHD or CMV infection in patients undergoing allogeneic HCT, giving rise to a significant unmet medical need.

The Phase 1 stage of the clinical trial is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm study that is intended to enroll approximately 10 subjects, all of whom must have an available matched unrelated peripheral blood cell donor and must be at high risk of CMV infection in the post -HCT period based on antibody evidence of a prior infection with CMV, designated as CMV seropositive, with no evidence of detectable CMV replication at baseline. All eligible patients enrolled in the Phase 1 stage of the study will be administered ProTmune as the hematopoietic cell source for the HCT procedure following myeloablative conditioning. After administering ProTmune to the first three subjects in the Phase 1 stage of the clinical trial, no further subjects will be enrolled until at least two of these first three subjects demonstrate neutrophil engraftment.

An independent data monitoring committee will conduct a safety review of data from the Phase 1 stage, and pending the committee&#8217;s recommendation, a 60-subject, randomized, controlled Phase 2 stage is expected to enroll, during which subjects undergoing mPB HCT following myeloablative conditioning will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to be administered either ProTmune or unmanipulated mPB cells as the hematopoietic cell source for HCT. Two Endpoint Adjudication Committees are expected to evaluate the efficacy of ProTmune in the clinical trial, one through assessing the incidence of acute GvHD and the other through assessing the incidence of CMV tissue-invasive disease, viremia and additional clinical outcomes.

The efficacy endpoints for the Phase 1/2 clinical trial are: cumulative incidence of Grades B through D acute GvHD at Day 100 based on EAC-adjudicated results (where Day 0 is defined as the day of HCT), where acute GvHD maximum severity will be graded according to the CIBMTR acute GvHD Grading Scale; cumulative incidence of subjects with CMV viremia by Day 100 (defined as CMV plasma viral load of &#8805;1000 IU/mL), as determined by central laboratory testing; and cumulative incidence of CMV tissue-invasive disease by Day 100, based on EAC-adjudicated results. We also plan to assess numerous exploratory endpoints, including cumulative incidence of confirmed bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections by Day 100 and by Day 180, cumulative incidence of GvHD-free and relapse-free survival and cumulative incidence of GvHD-free, infection-free and relapse-free survival.

Based on preclinical data, we believe ProTmune has the potential to suppress the GvHD response and maintain the anti-viral and anti-tumor, or graft-versus-leukemia (GvL), activity of donor T cells. We have demonstrated that FT1050-FT4145 programmed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of mPB are functionally less allo-reactive in vitro, exhibiting a decrease both in the expression levels of T-cell activation markers, including ICOS and 41BB, and in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in the production of potent anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10. In December 2015, we presented data at the American Society of Hematology 2015 Annual Meeting demonstrating that a single administration of FT1050-FT4145 programmed mPB cells result in a statistically-significant reduction in GvHD score and improvement in survival, as compared to vehicle-treated cells, in a murine model of allogeneic HCT. Additionally, in February 2016, we presented data at the 2016 BMT Tandem Meetings defining the impact of FT1050-FT4145 modulation on the anti-tumor effector properties of donor T cells in a murine model of leukemia and demonstrating that ex vivo programmed donor T cells retain GvL activity.

ProHema &#174; . On December 7, 2015, we announced interim data from our Phase 2 PUMA clinical trial of ProHema, a programmed hematopoietic cell therapy produced by modulating umbilical cord blood ex vivo with FT1050. Concurrently, we announced our election to discontinue all further clinical development of ProHema in umbilical cord blood HCT and focus our resources on the clinical development of ProTmune in mPB HCT. 

The open-label, randomized, controlled PUMA study was designed to assess ProHema in adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing double umbilical cord blood HCT (dUCBT). The PUMA study was intended to enroll 60 subjects, age 15 to 65 years, and was conducted at 11 leading allogeneic HCT centers in the United States. Eligible subjects were randomized, at a ratio of 2:1, with approximately 40 subjects expected to receive ProHema plus an unmanipulated cord blood unit, and approximately 20 concurrent control subjects expected to receive a standard dUCBT. Based upon physician choice, subjects were treated with one of two conditioning regimens, an intense myeloablative regimen (MAC) or a reduced&#8209;intensity regimen (RIC), to destroy malignant cells and to prevent rejection of the donor hematopoietic cells. Randomization was stratified by conditioning regimen. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) provided safety oversight during the conduct of the PUMA study.

&#160;

The primary endpoint of the PUMA stud y wa s based on a categorical analysis of neutrophil engraftment, and wa s powered to show with statistical significance that 70% of subjects with neutrophil engraftment in the ProHema treatment arm engraft prior to a pre &#8209;specified control day of neutrophil engraftment, which was established as 26 days for subjects receiving MAC and 21 days for subjects receiving RIC. Based on an October 15, 2015 data cut-off, the interim an alysis of the PUMA study showed that subjects administered ProHema had an increase in the incidence of early neutrophil engraftment and a reduction in the incidence of severe viral infection-related adverse events (Grade 3-5) following HCT. Specifically, the analysis showed: 

&#160;

&#183; 

24 of 28 subjects administered ProHema achieved neutrophil engraftment. 16 of these 24 subjects (67%) achieved early neutrophil engraftment prior to a pre-specified historical control median time of engraftment (which had been established as Day 26 for subjects receiving MAC and Day 21 for subjects receiving RIC). The overall reduction in the median time to neutrophil engraftment was 4.5 days, as compared to the applicable pre-specified historical control value. Two early deaths prior to engraftment, which were both attributed to the toxicity of the conditioning regimen received by the subjects, were reported in the ProHema arm. Two subjects administered ProHema failed to achieve neutrophil engraftment. 

&#160;

&#183; 

14 of 15 concurrent control subjects achieved neutrophil engraftment. Eight of these 14 subjects (57%) achieved early neutrophil engraftment prior to the applicable pre-specified historical control median. The overall reduction in the median time to neutrophil engraftment was 2 days, as compared to the applicable pre-specified historical control value. One subject failed to achieve neutrophil engraftment. 

&#160;

&#183; 

32% of subjects administered ProHema (9 of 28), as compared to 60% of concurrent control subjects (9 of 15), experienced one or more severe viral infection-related adverse events (Grade 3-5) following HCT; and, of the subjects who were CMV-seropositive at the time of HCT, 11% of subjects administered ProHema (2 of 18), as compared to 30% of concurrent control subjects (3 of 10), experienced one or more severe CMV-related adverse events (Grade 3-5) following HCT. 

&#160;

In connection with our election to discontinue all further clinical development of ProHema in umbilical cord blood HCT, two additional clinical trials of ProHema were also discontinued: the PROMPT study, an open&#8209;label Phase 1b clinical trial in pediatric subjects undergoing single umbilical cord blood transplantation (sUCBT) for the treatment of hematologic malignancies; and the PROVIDE study, an open&#8209;label Phase 1b clinical trial in pediatric subjects undergoing sUCBT for the treatment of inherited metabolic disorders. At the time of announcement of our election, two subjects had been administered ProHema in the PROMPT study and one subject had been administered ProHema in the PROVIDE study.

Adaptive NK Cell Therapy

Natural Killer, or NK, cells have an innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally-infected cells, and represent one of the body&#8217;s first lines of immunological defense. NK cells have the potential to protect healthy cells and induce death of abnormal cells through multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms include direct killing, by binding to stress ligands expressed by cells and releasing toxic granules, and antibody-mediated targeted killing, by binding to and enhancing the cancer-killing effect of antibodies through a process known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC.

Recent breakthroughs in cell-based cancer immunotherapy have been achieved by harnessing and optimizing the anti-tumor activity of T cells. NK cells, like T cells, have significant anti-tumor activity. Additionally, NK cells offer several unique advantages over T cells for use in cancer immunotherapy: the anti-tumor activity of NK cells is independent of tumor antigen exposure; the inhibitory mechanisms of NK cells prevent the killing of normal cells and tissue; and the synergistic interaction between NK cells and antibodies enables efficient and highly-targeted killing. To date, however, the isolation and administration of homogenous populations of persistent and potent NK cells has been challenging.

In July 2015, we entered into a collaboration to advance the development of a NK-cell cancer immunotherapy program with the University of Minnesota, whose investigators have identified a distinct class of NK cells, referred to as &#8220;adaptive&#8221; NK cells. Adaptive NK cells have an epigenetic profile similar to that of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and express a unique metabolic profile that promotes long-term persistence in vivo . We have identified small molecule modulators that induce high levels of CD16 expression on adaptive NK cells. CD16 is a cell-surface protein that allows NK cells to bind to and synergize with monoclonal antibodies to efficiently destroy cancer cells.

In collaboration with Dr. Jeffrey Miller, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Deputy Director, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, we are advancing our programmed adaptive NK cell therapy through clinical translation. We intend to develop our adaptive NK cell therapy for the treatment of solid tumors in combination with widely-used, FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies, such as Herceptin, Erbitux and Rituxan. Monoclonal antibodies are prevalently used to treat cancer and generate over $50.0 billion in reported 

&#160;

annual sales. We believe our programmed ad aptive NK cell therapy may enhance t argeted cancer cell - killing in combination with monoclonal antibodies through ADCC and has the potential to serve a large number of patients who respond poorly to single-agent treatment with monoclonal antibodies. 

Programmed CD34+ Cell Therapy

Autoimmune diseases arise from abnormal immune responses in which the body&#8217;s immune system attacks and damages its own tissues. Some of the most common autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and asthma. It is estimated that more than 23 million people in the U.S. suffer from autoimmunity, which makes it the third most common category of illness in the U.S. after cancer and heart disease.

Auto-reactive T lymphocytes are key players in aberrant autoimmune responses. We believe that certain biological mechanisms, which have been demonstrated to suppress activation of T cells in the presence of tumor cells, can be exploited to suppress auto-reactive T-cell destruction of normal tissues. Cancerous cells often evade the immune system by expressing programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), a ligand that binds to the cell-surface receptor PD-1 on T lymphocytes and prevents T-cell activation. The PD-1 / PD-L1 biological axis has been clinically-validated as a potent immuno-suppressive pathway, and certain monoclonal antibodies, commonly referred to as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been shown to block the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1, boosting the immune system and enhancing T-cell killing of cancer cells.

We believe CD34+ cells possess intrinsic immuno-regulatory properties that are triggered under certain physiological conditions and, once triggered, have the potential to suppress activated T cells through the cell-surface expression of PD-L1 and the expression of potent immuno-modulatory enzymes. We seek to exploit these immuno-regulatory properties of CD34+ cells to down-regulate and suppress the body&#8217;s attack on its own tissues. We are advancing the development of a pharmacologically-programmed CD34+ cell therapy with enhanced immuno-regulatory potential for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We are currently investigating our programmed CD34+ cell therapy in several preclinical models of T cell-mediated immune dysfunction.

In June 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital and its investigator, Paolo Fiorina, M.D., Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, to accelerate the development of our programmed CD34+ cell therapy. Dr. Fiorina and his team have extensively studied the cellular mechanisms and molecular pathways involved in the autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells that result in insulin deficiency and onset of type 1 diabetes. Preclinical data from the Fiorina laboratory, which was presented at the American Diabetes Association&#8217;s 75th Scientific Sessions in June 2015, show that genetically-engineered PD-L1+ hematopoietic cells adoptively transferred into hyperglycemic mice traffic to the pancreas, reduce aberrant T-cell activity and revert hyperglycemia in a well-established murine model of type 1 diabetes.

Programmed iPSC-derived Immunotherapies

We believe induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, have the potential to enable the next frontier in the development of cell therapy. The seminal discovery that it is possible to reprogram the fate of fully&#8209;differentiated human cells ex vivo through the expression of certain genes and factors, such that the reprogrammed cell&#8217;s cellular and physiological traits are similar to those of an embryonic stem cell, is one of the most remarkable scientific breakthroughs of the past decade and was recognized with the 2012 Nobel Prize in Science and Medicine. In collaboration with two of our Scientific Founders, Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and Dr. Sheng Ding of the Gladstone Institute at UCSF, we have developed a proprietary, small molecule&#8209;enhanced iPSC platform for the generation and maintenance of pluripotent cells in a consistent, scalable and highly efficient manner. Our iPSC platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 60 issued patents and 90 pending patent applications that we own or license. 

Since induced pluripotent cells are capable of long-term self-renewal and can be used to generate almost any functional cell, we believe iPSCs are an ideal source for the development of disruptive off-the-shelf adoptive immunotherapies. Our patent-protected iPSC platform has the potential to consistently create large quantities of homogeneous hematopoietic cell populations, which would otherwise be limited in quantity, difficult to manufacture, heterogeneous in composition and unoptimized for efficacy. Specifically, our iPSC platform, which combines genetic engineering with rapid and efficient generation of immune cells, is designed to enable the generation of highly-stable, genetically-modified, clonal pluripotent cell lines and to utilize these lines for the unlimited production of engineered CD34+ cell-, NK cell- and T cell-based therapies without requiring patient-sourced cells. 

We believe our pluripotent cell line approach is disruptive and has the potential to overcome key limitations of patient-sourced cell therapies, such as the requirement to source, isolate, engineer and expand cells for each individual patient, and may prove to be 

&#160;

the cornerstone of off-the-shelf cellular immunotherapy. We are extensively characteriz ing the properties of pluripotent cell line-derived immune cells, including CD34+ cells, NK cells and progenitor T cells, and evaluating their functionality in vitro and in vivo . 

In July 2015, we entered into a collaboration with the University of Minnesota to advance the development of a pluripotent cell-derived, engineered, NK-cell cancer immunotherapy. In published findings, our collaborators have shown that a standardized, homogenous NK-cell population can be produced efficiently and in large quantities from a human pluripotent cell line, and NK cells derived from a pluripotent cell line have potent anti-tumor activity in vivo in two different preclinical models of ovarian cancer. We believe these findings demonstrate that pluripotent cells have promising potential to be effectively utilized as a source for off-the-shelf NK-cell cancer immunotherapy. 

Our Cell Programming Partnerships

Juno Therapeutics

T-cell immunotherapies commonly use a patient&#8217;s own T cells as the starting cell source to manufacture a personalized cell therapy. T cells sourced from patients require in vitro culturing, activation and expansion, usually over a period of days to weeks, to generate the number of cells that are therapeutically necessary for use as an immunotherapy. Significant challenges associated with this therapeutic paradigm include a high degree of patient-to-patient variability in the ability to harvest and expand T cells and the propensity for T cells to become &#8220;exhausted&#8221; during in vitro processing. These challenges can negatively affect T-cell function in vivo upon administration to a patient. In fact, clinical studies have shown that the anti-tumor properties of exhausted T cells are less durable and efficacious.

In May 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration and license agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc., or Juno, bringing together our expertise in hematopoietic cell biology and cell programming with Juno&#8217;s scientific and development leadership in CAR, or chimeric antigen receptor, T-cell and TCR, or T-cell receptor, immunotherapy. Under the collaboration, we screen for and seek to identify small molecule modulators that improve the function of T cells, including for molecules that enhance the therapeutic properties of CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies. Juno has the right to incorporate such modulators in their development and commercialization of genetically-engineered CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies directed against certain tumor-associated antigen targets designated by Juno. Juno is responsible for the development and commercialization of genetically-engineered CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies incorporating such modulators against such targets.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Juno paid us an upfront payment of $5.0 million, and purchased one million shares of our common stock, at $8.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 million. Additionally, Juno agreed to fund all of our collaboration research activities for an initial four-year research term ending in May 2019, with minimum annual research payments of $2.0 million to us. Juno has the option to extend the exclusive research term for an additional two years beyond the initial four-year term, subject to the payment of a one-time, non-refundable extension fee of $3.0 million and the continued funding of our activities under the collaboration during the extended term, with minimum annual research payments of $4.0 million to us during the two-year extension period. Additionally, if Juno elects to exercise its extension option, Fate then has the option to require Juno to purchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock at a premium equal to 120% of the then thirty-day trailing volume weighted average trading price.

We are eligible under the agreement to receive selection fees for each tumor-associated antigen target selected by Juno and bonus selection fees based on the aggregate number of tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno. Additionally, in connection with each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us non-refundable, non-creditable milestone payments totaling up to approximately $51.0 million, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Additionally, in connection with the third Juno therapy and the fifth Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, Juno has agreed to pay us additional non-refundable, non-creditable bonus milestone payments totaling up to approximately $116.0 million and $137.5 million, respectively, in the aggregate, per therapy upon the achievement of various clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones.

Beginning on the date of the first commercial sale (in each country) for each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators, and continuing until the later of i) the expiration of the last valid patent claim, ii) ten years after such first commercial sale, or iii) the expiration of all data and other regulatory exclusivity periods afforded each therapy, Juno has agreed to pay us royalties in the low single-digits on net sales of each Juno therapy that uses or incorporates our small molecule modulators.

Under the agreement, we have granted Juno an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property, including our intellectual property arising under the collaboration, to make, use, sell and otherwise exploit genetically-engineered CAR T cell and TCR immunotherapies using or incorporating small molecule modulators directed against certain designated tumor-associated antigen 

&#160;

targets, subject to the selection of such target by Juno. We ha ve retained exclusive rights to such intellectual property, including our intellectual property arising under the collaboration, for all other purposes . 

During the term of our research activities under the agreement, we have agreed to collaborate exclusively with Juno on the research and development of small molecule modulators with respect to CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies against certain tumor-associated antigen targets designated by Juno. Furthermore, during the term of the agreement, we will be unable to conduct, or enable third parties to conduct, research, development and commercialization activities using small molecule modulators to enhance the therapeutic properties of CAR T-cell and TCR immunotherapies against certain tumor-associated antigen targets selected by Juno.

Our Intellectual Property

Overview

We seek to protect our product candidates and our cell programming technology through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our platform technologies and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection and, in addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we typically file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and China. We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy in order to best fortify our position, and we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy warrants such filings. We also rely on know&#8209;how, continuing technological innovation and in&#8209;licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We have entered into exclusive license agreements with various academic and research institutions to obtain the rights to use certain patents for the development and commercialization of our product candidates.

As of March 2, 2016, our intellectual property portfolio is composed of 114 issued patents and 150 patent applications that we license from academic and research institutions, and 76 issued patents or pending patent applications that we own. These patents and patent applications generally provide us with the rights to develop our product candidates in the United States and worldwide. This portfolio covers compositions of programmed cellular immunotherapeutics, including ProTmune, our cell programming approach for enhancing the therapeutic function of cells ex vivo , and our platform for industrial&#8209;scale iPSC generation and engineering. We believe that we have a significant intellectual property position and substantial know&#8209;how relating to the programming of hematopoietic and immune cells and to the derivation, genetic engineering, and differentiation of iPSCs.

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. Please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property&#8221; for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.

Intellectual Property Relating to the Programming of Hematopoietic and Immune Cells

As of March 2, 2016, we own 13 families of U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications covering our cell programming technology and compositions of programmed cellular immunotherapies. This portfolio includes 41 issued patents or pending patent applications relating to methods of programming the biological properties and therapeutic function of cells ex vivo , and the resulting therapeutic compositions of hematopoietic and immune cells. Patents and patent applications in this portfolio include claims covering (i) therapeutic compositions of hematopoietic and immune cells, including T cells, NK cells, and CD34+ cells, that have been programmed ex vivo with one or more agents to optimize their therapeutic function for application in oncology and immune disorders and (ii) methods of programming cells including by the activation or inhibition of therapeutically-relevant genes and cell-surface proteins, such as those involved in the homing, proliferation and survival of hematopoietic cells or those involved in the persistence, proliferation and reactivity of immune cells. Any U.S. patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue from pending patent applications will have statutory expiration dates between 2030 and 2037.

Additionally, we have an exclusive license to an intellectual property portfolio consisting of two families of issued patents and pending patent applications co&#8209;owned by the Children&#8217;s Medical Center Corporation and The General Hospital Corporation. As of March 2, 2016, we currently have exclusive rights to 54 issued patents or patent applications in the United States and worldwide relating to methods for programming hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo using modulators that up&#8209;regulate the prostaglandin signaling pathway or its downstream mediators. These patent rights consist of issued patents (including U.S. Patents 8,168,428 and 8,563,310) claiming methods for the ex vivo programming of hematopoietic stem cells using FT1050, including hematopoietic stem cells obtained from mobilized peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow. Pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions are directed to therapeutic compositions of hematopoietic stem cells in which the cells have been modulated by increasing prostaglandin activity, methods of preparing these compositions, and methods of promoting hematopoietic reconstitution, 

&#160;

expansion and self &#8209;renewal using modulators that increase prostaglandin signaling activity. Any U.S. patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue will have a statutory expiration date in 2027. 

We have also licensed exclusive rights to two families of issued patents and patent applications from the Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation. This portfolio includes patent applications claiming methods of enhancing HCT procedures by altering prostaglandin activity in hematopoietic stem cells as well as an issued U.S. patent and patent applications claiming methods of enhancing viral transduction efficiency in the genetic engineering of stem cells, including hematopoietic stem cells. These applications describe methods of increasing mobilization of stem cells from a stem cell donor, and methods for increasing hematopoietic stem cells homing and engraftment in a stem cell transplant recipient. One family of applications is directed to preferentially modulating certain receptors present on hematopoietic stem cells to increase the therapeutic potential of such cells for homing and engraftment. Claims in these applications specifically cover the modulation of mobilized peripheral blood by altering prostaglandin activity and methods for increasing viral transduction efficiency for gene therapy. Any patents that have issued or that may issue from patent applications in this portfolio will expire in 2029 or 2030.

We also have the exclusive right to negotiate licenses to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to certain intellectual property portfolios directed to NK cells, including adaptive NK cells and genetically-engineered NK cells, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer using these NK cells, pursuant to exclusive option agreements that we have entered into with the University of Minnesota.

Intellectual Property Relating to iPSC Technology

As of March 2, 2016, we own six patent families directed to programming the fate of somatic cells ex vivo , including patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally related to our platform for industrial&#8209;scale iPSC generation and applications related to differentiation of iPSCs into specialized cells with therapeutic potential. These patent applications cover our proprietary small molecule&#8209;enhanced iPSC platform, including novel reprogramming factors and methods of reprogramming to obtain iPSCs. Our intellectual property portfolio also includes gene editing compositions and methods of genetic engineering, as well as methods of directing the fate of cells to obtain homogenous cell populations in the hematopoietic lineage, including CD34+ cells, T cells and NK cells. Our proprietary intellectual property enables highly&#8209;efficient iPSC derivation, selection, engineering, and clonal expansion while maintaining high quality, homogeneous cells. Any patents issued from these patent applications will expire on dates ranging from 2031 to 2037.

Additionally, we have licensed from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research a portfolio of four patent families including issued patents and pending applications broadly applicable to the reprogramming of somatic cells. Our license is exclusive in commercial fields, including for drug discovery and therapeutic purposes. This portfolio covers the generation of human pluripotent cells from somatic cells and, as of March 2, 2016, includes eight issued U.S. patents (including U.S. Patents 8,071,369 and 7,682,828) claiming compositions used in the reprogramming of mammalian somatic cells to a less differentiated state (including to a pluripotent state), and methods of making a cell more susceptible to reprogramming. Specifically, the portfolio includes a composition of matter patent issued in the United States covering a cellular composition comprising a somatic cell having an exogenous nucleic acid that encodes an Oct4 protein. Oct4 is the key pluripotency gene most commonly required for the generation of human iPSCs. These issued patents and any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications will expire on dates ranging from 2024 to 2029.

Our license i s also subject to pre &#8209;existing rights of the U.S. government and rights retained by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the General Hospital Corporation to use the patent rights for research purposes. Additionally, if we make any discovery or invention that is described in a patent application and is not within the scope of the licensed patent rights but would not have been made but for the licensed patent rights, we are required to disclose the invention to CMCC and enter into a non &#8209;exclusive license a greement with CMCC, for no more than a nominal fee, for CMCC to practice the invention solely for internal research purposes or clinical purposes and not for commercial purposes. 

Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay to CMCC an annual license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement. We also are required to make payments to CMCC of up to $5.0 million per product in development, regulatory and sales milestones. If commercial sales of a licensed product commence, we will pay CMCC royalties at percentage rates ranging in the low&#8209; to mid&#8209;single digits on net sales of licensed products in countries where such product is protected by patent rights. Our obligation to pay royalties continues on a country by country basis until the expiration of all licensed patent rights covering licensed products in such country, and our royalty payments will be reduced by other payments we are required to make to third parties until a minimum royalty percentage has been reached. In the event that we sublicense the patent rights, CMCC is also entitled to receive a percentage of the sublicensing income received by us.

Under the license with CMCC, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring a licensed product to market as soon as practicable, and also to use good faith and diligent efforts to manufacture and distribute a licensed product, and make licensed products reasonably available to the public during the term of the agreement. We are also required to use good faith and diligent efforts to meet the milestones set forth in development plans as part of the agreement, subject to any revisions to the development plans that may be permitted under certain circumstances. Additionally, if a third party expresses interest in an area under the license that we are not pursuing, under the terms of our agreement with CMCC, we may be required to sublicense rights in that area to the third party.

The agreement will continue until the last to expire of the patent rights. We may terminate the agreement by providing prior written notice to CMCC, and CMCC has the right to terminate the agreement if we fail to pay royalties or otherwise materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within a specified grace period. CMCC may also terminate the agreement should we cease operations or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency.

Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research

In February 2009, we entered into a license agreement with the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, as amended in October 2009 and September 2010, for rights relating to compositions and methods for reprogramming somatic cells to a less differentiated or pluripotent state. Under our agreement with the Whitehead Institute, we acquired an exclusive royalty&#8209;bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license to make, use and sell licensed products in all fields for commercial purposes, excluding the sale or distribution of reagents for basic research use. The licensed patent rights are described in more detail above under &#8220;Intellectual Property Relating to iPSC Technology.&#8221; The Whitehead Institute retains the right to practice the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes, including in corporate&#8209;sponsored research under limited circumstances and in some cases only after obtaining our consent. The Whitehead Institute also retains the right to license other academic and non&#8209;profit research institutes to practice the patent rights for research, teaching and educational purposes, but not for corporate&#8209;sponsored research. Our license is also subject to pre&#8209;existing rights of the U.S. government.

Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay the Whitehead Institute an annual license maintenance fee during the term of the agreement, and are also required to make payments of up to $2.3 million for development and regulatory milestones achieved with respect to licensed products. If commercial sales of a licensed product commence, we will also be required to pay royalties at percentage rates in the low&#8209;single digits on net sales of licensed products. Our royalty payments are subject to reduction for any third&#8209;party payments required to be made until a minimum royalty percentage has been reached. In the event that we sublicense the patent rights, the Whitehead Institute is also entitled to receive a percentage of the sublicensing income received by us.

Under the license agreement with the Whitehead Institute, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products, and to make licensed products or processes reasonably available to the public. In particular, we are required to commit a minimum amount of funding toward the development of a licensed product on an annual basis or conduct activities toward specific development milestones.

&#160;

The agreement will continue until the abandonment of all patent rights or expiration of the last to expire licensed patent. The Whitehead Institute may terminate the agreement if we default in the performance of any of our obligatio ns and fail to cure the default within a specified grace period, or if we institute a proceeding to challenge the patent rights. The Whitehead Institute may also terminate the agreement if we cease to carry out our business or become bankrupt or insolvent. We may terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the Whitehead Institute and payment of all amounts due to the Whitehead Institute through the date of termination. 

The Scripps Research Institute

We have entered into various license agreements with The Scripps Research Institute, or TSRI, for rights relating to compositions and methods for reprogramming somatic cells, including the use of various small molecule classes and compounds in the reprogramming and maintenance of iPSCs. Under our agreements with TSRI, or the TSRI License Agreements, we acquired exclusive royalty&#8209;bearing, sublicensable, worldwide licenses to make, use and sell products covered by the licensed patent rights, and to perform licensed processes, in each case, in all fields. The licensed patent rights are described in more detail above under &#8220;Intellectual Property Relating to iPSC Technology.&#8221; TSRI retains a non&#8209;exclusive right to practice and use the patent rights for non&#8209;commercial educational and research purposes, and to license other academic and non&#8209;profit research institutions to practice the patent rights for internal basic research and education purposes. Under certain of our TSRI License Agreements, other third parties maintain a right to practice the patent rights for their internal use only. Our license is also subject to pre&#8209;existing rights of the U.S. government.

Under the terms of the TSRI License Agreements, we are required to pay to TSRI annual minimum fees during the term of each agreement. Additionally, upon the achievement of specific regulatory and commercial milestones, we are required to make payments to TSRI of up to approximately $1.75 million under each of the TSRI License Agreements. We will also be required to pay TSRI royalties at percentage rates ranging in the low&#8209; to mid&#8209;single digits on net sales of licensed products. In the event that we sublicense the patent rights, TSRI is also entitled to receive a percentage of the sublicensing income received by us.

Under the TSRI License Agreements, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the development benchmarks set out in development plans under each of the TSRI License Agreements, or otherwise expend a minimum specified amount per year for product development. TSRI has the right to terminate any TSRI License Agreement if we fail to perform our obligations under the applicable agreement, including failure to meet any development benchmark or to use commercially reasonable efforts and due diligence to develop a licensed product, or if we otherwise breach the agreement, challenge the licensed patent rights, are convicted of a felony involving the development or commercialization of a licensed product or process, or become insolvent. We may terminate any of our TSRI License Agreements by providing ninety days&#8217; written notice to TSRI. Each TSRI License Agreement otherwise terminates upon the termination of royalty obligations under such agreement.

&#160;

Manufacturing

We are responsible for ensuring consistent manufacture in compliance with regulatory requirements as necessary for marketing approval. We do not own or operate any of our own manufacturing facilities. Other than small amounts of materials that we may synthesize ourselves for preclinical testing, we currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our required materials, including our clinical materials and product candidates.

ProTmune is a composition of ex vivo programmed human mobilized peripheral blood cells. ProTmune is produced by treating qualified human mobilized peripheral blood with two small molecules, FT1050 and FT4145, in a multi&#8209;step process that is performed on the day of HCT. Currently, the manufacture of ProTmune is performed at clinical cell processing facilities operated by or affiliated with our clinical sites. The manufacturing process consists of functionally closed unit operations. We aim to continue to develop manufacturing processes to further standardize the manufacture of ProTmune across clinical cell processing facilities.

Human peripheral blood cells from a donor, whose tissue type closely matches the patient&#8217;s, are used as the starting cellular source material for the manufacture of ProTmune. HCT centers can electronically access a worldwide network of donor registries, which collect and transfer human peripheral blood cells from donors, to source these cells on behalf of patients. We expect donor registries to continue to collect and transfer, and HCT centers to continue to source, human peripheral blood cells for our manufacture of ProTmune. Other components used in the manufacture of ProTmune include programming media as well as disposable materials, such as bags and tubing sets. To date, we have obtained all components required for the manufacture of ProTmune, including FT1050, FT4145 and programming media, from third&#8209;party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long&#8209;term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain human peripheral blood cells and certain components used in the manufacture of ProTmune.

&#160;

For the conduct of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProTmune, the clinical cell p rocessing f acility at eac h participating site will be qualified and trained by our technical staff to manufacture ProTmune . Our technical representative(s) will be on - site at the clinical cell processing facility for each of the first two subjects administered ProTmune. ProTmune w ill be released immediately by the clinical cell processing facility staff after final processing, including filtration, final packaging, rapid release testing, and labeling. In the future , we may manufacture ProTmune at facilities operated by us, by trans plant centers, or by third parties. 

Marketing &#38; Sales

We currently intend to commercialize any products that we may successfully develop. We currently have limited experience in marketing or selling therapeutic products. To market any of our products independently would require us to develop a sales force with technical expertise along with establishing commercial infrastructure and capabilities. Our commercial strategy for marketing our products also may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial infrastructure. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for one of our product candidates.

Government Regulation

In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and related regulations, and drugs under the FDCA and related regulations. Biological products and drugs are also subject to other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biological products and drugs. These agencies and other federal, state, local, and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, reporting, approval or licensing, advertising and promotion, and import and export of our products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. In addition, government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.

Marketing Approval

The process required by the FDA before biological products and drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal tests according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well&#8209;controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product or drug for its intended use or uses; 

&#160;

&#183; 

for a biological product, submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and, for a drug, submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, that includes substantive evidence of the product&#8217;s safety and efficacy; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre&#8209;approval inspection of manufacturing facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate, and, if applicable, the FDA&#8217;s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study sites and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA and review and approval of the NDA which must occur before a biological product and a drug can be marketed or sold. 

&#160;

U.S. Biological Products and Drug Development Process 

Before testing any biological product or drug candidate in humans, nonclinical tests, including laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate, are conducted. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.

Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, the trial sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an initial IND application. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, within the 30&#8209;day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such case, the sponsor of the IND application must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials due to safety concerns or non&#8209;compliance. If a clinical hold is imposed, a trial may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study subjects and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA and to the IRB.

For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap:

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1&#8212;The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life&#8209;threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2&#8212;These trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3&#8212;Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further evaluate dosage, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product has been obtained, and are intended to establish the overall benefit&#8209;risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. 

Post&#8209;approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended indication, particularly for long&#8209;term safety follow&#8209;up. The FDA has statutory authority to require post&#8209;market clinical trials to address safety issues. All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life&#8209;threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#8217;s initial receipt of the information.

&#160;

Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarl y, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB &#8217; s requirements or if the investigated product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients, an d the trial may not recommence without the IRB &#8217; s authorization. 

Typically, if a product is intended to treat a chronic disease, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more.

Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes

In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product for the proposed indication. Similarly, for a drug, an NDA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data demonstrating the drug is safe and effective. Both a BLA and an NDA include all data available from nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s manufacture and composition, and proposed labeling.

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA and NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA&#8217;s fee schedule, effective beginning on October 1, 2015 and in effect through September 30, 2016, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA and an NDA, will be $2,374,200 for fiscal year 2016. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and drugs ($114,450 for fiscal year 2016), and an annual establishment fee ($585,200 for fiscal year 2016) on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics or drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non&#8209;orphan indication.

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA or NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA or NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the BLA or NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA or NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMPs to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity, and for a biological product, whether it meets the biological product standards. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically comprised of clinicians and other experts, for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTPs. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA may inspect clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCPs. If the FDA determines the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will require the facility to take corrective action and provide documentation evidencing the implementation of such corrective action, which may delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in 

&#160;

accordance with GCPs, the FDA may determine the data generated by the site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA or NDA, and request additional testing or data. Additionally, the FDA ultimately may still decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 

The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a biological product or drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the BLA or NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the BLA or NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include &#8220;dear doctor letters,&#8221; a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated as part of the BLA or NDA approval, and in some cases may delay the approval date. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.

After the FDA completes its initial review of a BLA or NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the biological product will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the BLA or NDA will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the applicant in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

One of the performance goals of the FDA under PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs and NDAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs and NDAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and NDAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal data may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA or NDA applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post&#8209;marketing clinical trials and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in the imposition of new restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market.

Expedited Development and Review Programs

The FDA has a Fast Track program intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life&#8209;threatening condition or disease and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biological product or drug may request the FDA to designate the biologic or drug as a Fast Track product at any time during clinical development. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a biological product or drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life&#8209;threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well&#8209;controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the 

&#160;

FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product or drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well &#8209;controlled post &#8209;marketing clinic al trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre &#8209;approval of promotional materials. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, also amended the FDCA to require FDA to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A biological product or drug can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life&#8209;threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a biological product or drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product&#8217;s marketing application, including by meeting with, and providing advice to, the sponsor throughout the product&#8217;s development, and taking steps to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity

Under certain circumstances, U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch&#8209;Waxman Amendments. Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The period of patent term restoration is generally one&#8209;half the time between the effective date of an IND application (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA or NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA. A patent term extension is only available when the FDA approves a biological product or drug for the first time.

With the Hatch&#8209;Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit to the agency an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, which relies on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. For the ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. The FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug.

An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, a FDA&#8209;licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or PPACA. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product is biosimilar to the reference biological product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the product and the reference product may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product.

A reference biological product is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biological product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant&#8217;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic&#8217;s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42&#8209;month period.

A biological product or drug can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six&#8209;month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA&#8209;issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a study.

&#160;

FDA Post &#8209;Approval Requirements 

FDA regulation of biological products and drugs continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. Other post&#8209;approval requirements applicable to biological products and drugs include record&#8209;keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the BLA holder must report GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, and the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#8217;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.

Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, by us or our suppliers, may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. FDA sanctions include refusal to approve pending applications, suspension or revocation of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.

Biological product and drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products and drugs are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Labeling, Marketing and Promotion

The FDA closely regulates the labeling, marketing and promotion of biological products and drugs, including direct&#8209;to&#8209;consumer advertising, promotional activities involving the internet, and industry&#8209;sponsored scientific and educational activities that are not independent of the influence of the supporting company. While doctors are free to prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and efficacy of a biological product or drug that are consistent with FDA approval, and the company is allowed to market a biological product or drug only for the particular use and treatment approved by the FDA. In addition, any claims in product advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety and risk information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, untitled or warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions, potential civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from government healthcare programs.

Orphan Designation

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to biological products and drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product or drug in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the applicant, the name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

If a biological product or drug that receives orphan designation is the first such product approved by FDA for the orphan indication, it receives orphan product exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another application to market the same product for the same indication. Orphan product exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the new product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or if the company with the orphan product exclusivity is unable to meet market demand. More than one product may also be approved by the FDA for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products are different. If a biological product or drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.

&#160;

Pediatric Research Equity Act 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or NDA or supplement must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product or drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The intent of PREA is to compel sponsors whose products have pediatric applicability to study those products in pediatric populations. FDASIA requires manufacturers of biological products and drugs that include a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to submit a pediatric study plan to the FDA as part of the IND application. The plan must be submitted not later than 60 days after the end&#8209;of&#8209;Phase 2 meeting with the FDA; or if there is no such meeting, before the initiation of any Phase 3 trials or a combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial; or if no such trial will be conducted, no later than 210 days before submitting a marketing application or supplement. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. By its terms, PREA does not apply to any biological product or drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, unless the FDA issues regulations saying otherwise. Because the FDA has not issued any such regulations, submission of a pediatric assessment is not required for an application to market a product for an orphan&#8209;designated indication.

Anti&#8209;Kickback and False Claims Laws

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of biological products and drugs are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the Anti&#8209;Kickback Statute, as amended, the federal False Claims Act, as amended (the False Claims Act), the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended, and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

In the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; including, but not limited to, the Anti&#8209;Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti&#8209;Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a biological product or drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or order of an item for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti&#8209;Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti&#8209;kickback laws and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under anti&#8209;kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject.

The False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including biological products and drugs, that are false or fraudulent. Manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#8220;cause&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off&#8209;label. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. A False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the False Claims Act.

There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. In addition, a federal law requires manufacturers of biological products and drugs that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program to track and report to the federal government certain payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. Many of these laws are evolving and may contain ambiguities as to what is required for compliance or the penalties for non&#8209;compliance.

&#160;

Other Regulations 

We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

Insurance

We maintain product liability insurance for our clinical trials. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for products in development. However, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. In addition, we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 60 full&#8209;time employees, including 35 in research and development, 16 in clinical development and regulatory affairs and 9 in general and administrative. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
