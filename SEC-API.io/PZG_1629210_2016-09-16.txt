INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSACTIONS

On April 17, 2015, we entered into the previously disclosed separation and distribution agreement (the &#8220;Separation Agreement&#8221;) with Paramount Gold and Silver Corp. (&#8220;PGSC&#8221;), to effect the separation (the &#8220;separation&#8221;) of the Company from PGSC, and to provide for the allocation between the Company and PGSC of the Company&#8217;s and PGSC&#8217;s assets, liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to, at and after the separation.

We filed a registration statement on Form S-1 in connection with the distribution (the &#8220;distribution&#8221;) by PGSC to its stockholders of all the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share. The registration statement was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on April 9, 2015. On April 6, 2015, the Company filed a Form 8-A with the SEC to register its shares of common stock under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The distribution, which effected a spin-off of the Company from PGSC, was made on April 17, 2015, to PGSC stockholders of record on April 14, 2015. On the distribution date, stockholders of PGSC received one share of Company common stock for every 20 shares of PGSC common stock held. Up to and including the distribution date, PGSC common stock traded on the &#8220;regular-way&#8221; market&#894; that is, with an entitlement to shares of Company common stock distributed pursuant to the distribution. As a result of the distribution, the Company is now a publicly traded company independent from PGSC. On April 20, 2015, the Company&#8217;s shares of common stock commenced trading on the NYSE MKT LLC under the symbol &#8220;PZG&#8221;. An aggregate of 8,101,371 shares of Company common stock were distributed in the distribution. In connection with our separation from PGSC and PGSC&#8217;s merger with and into Coeur Mining, Inc. (&#8220;Coeur&#8221;), PGSC contributed approximately $8.45 million to us as an equity contribution, and we issued 417,420 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, to Coeur in exchange for a cash payment by Coeur in the amount of $1.47 million.

As previously announced on March 14, 2016, Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. (&#8220;Paramount&#8221;) and Calico Resources Corp. (&#8220;Calico&#8221;) entered into an Arrangement Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) providing for the acquisition of Calico by Paramount (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). On July 7, 2016, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Calico became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paramount. 

On July 7, 2016, Paramount and Calico completed the transaction contemplated by the Agreement, pursuant to which Calico became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Paramount. Pursuant to the Agreement, at the effective time, each issued and outstanding share of Calico common share, no par value per share, was converted into the right to receive 0.07 of a share of common stock of Paramount, par value $0.01 per share. No cash or other compensation was paid for fractional shares. Paramount issued approximately 7.2 million shares of Paramount common stock as consideration in the transaction. Based on the closing price of Paramount common stock on July 6, 2016 as reported on the New York Stock Exchange MKT, the aggregate value of the consideration paid or payable to former holders of Calico&#8217;s common shares is approximately $15.2 million.

The requisite approval of the Plan of Arrangement by the Calico shareholders was obtained at annual and special meeting of the Calico shareholders held on June 29, 2016. On July 5, 2016, a final order (the &#8220;Final Order&#8221;) was entered by the Supreme Court of British Columbia (the &#8220;Court&#8221;) in connection with the Plan of Arrangement (Vancouver Registry No. S-105075). 

OVERVIEW OF PARAMOUNT GOLD NEVADA CORP.

We are an emerging growth company engaged in the business of acquiring, exploring and developing precious metal projects in the United States of America. Paramount owns advanced stage exploration projects in the states of Nevada and Oregon. We enhance the value of our projects by implementing exploration and engineering programs that are likely to expand and upgrade known mineralized material to reserves. Paramount believes there are several ways to realize the value of its projects: selling its projects to producers; joint venturing its projects with other companies; or building and operating small mines on its own.

The Company&#8217;s principal Nevada interest, the Sleeper Gold Project, is located in Humboldt County, Nevada, and was a producing mine until 1996.

Our project located in Oregon, known as the Grassy Mountain Project (&#8220;Grassy&#8221;), is located in Malheur County, Oregon, and was acquired by way of statutory plan of arrangement in the Province of British Columbia, Canada with Calico in July 2016.

INTER-CORPORATE RELATIONSHIPS 

We currently have four active wholly owned direct subsidiaries:

New Sleeper Gold LLC and Sleeper Mining Company, LLC, which operate our mining interests in Nevada.

Calico Resources Corp. and Calico Resources USA Corp., which holds our interest in the Grassy Mountain Project in Oregon.

The Company&#8217;s corporate structure is as follows:

&#160;

COMPETITION

The mineral exploration industry is highly competitive. We compete with junior and senior mineral exploration companies, independent producers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to acquire mineral exploration properties throughout the United States together with the equipment, labor and materials required to explore on those properties. Competition for the acquisition of mineral exploration interests is intense with many mineral exploration leases or concessions available through a competitive bidding process in which we may lack the technological information or expertise available to other bidders. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquiring mineral exploration interests of merit or on exploring or developing their mineral exploration properties. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire mineral exploration properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may choose to finance their exploration and development projects instead of the Company&#8217;s. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to acquire further mineral exploration interests.

We do not compete with anyone with respect to our existing mineral claims because they are 100% controlled or owned by us. We believe we have or can acquire on reasonable terms the equipment, labor and materials necessary to explore our current properties. Because there is presently no known mineral reserve at this time on our existing properties, we have not determined the impact of any capital expenditures on our earnings or competitive position in the event a potentially commercially mineable ore deposit is discovered.

UNITED STATES REGULATIONS 

Mining Claims : Exploration activities on our properties are conducted both upon federally-owned land and private land. Most federally-owned land is administered by the Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;). On existing claims owned by the federal government, we are required to pay annual claim maintenance fees of $155 per claim on or before September 1st at the State Office of the BLM. In addition, we are required to pay the county recorder of the county in which the claim is situated an annual fee of $10.50 per claim. On certain claims, we are required to pay a fee for each 20 acres of an association placer. For any new claims we acquire by staking, we must file a certificate of location with the State Office of the BLM within 90 days of making the claim along with a fee equal to the amount of the annual claim maintenance fee.

Mining Exploration : BLM regulations require, and we have obtained, permits for surface disturbances to conduct our exploration activities. At our Sleeper Gold Project, there are also numerous permits in place that are maintained from the previous mine operations. We maintain these permits for ease in updating should a decision be made to reinitiate production at the Sleeper Gold mine. Maintenance of these permits includes monthly, quarterly and annual monitoring and reporting to various government agencies and departments. 

Environmental and Reclamation : Our Sleeper Gold Project is currently operated as an advanced exploration project and is subject to various permit requirements. We are required to submit a plan of operation, obtain permitting and post bonds that guarantee that reclamation is performed on lands associated with exploration. 

We are also responsible for managing the reclamation requirements from the previous mine operations and have a bond posted with the BLM to guarantee that reclamation is performed on the associated mine facilities and activities.

We expect that our annual obligations to satisfy reclamation requirements to be approximately $807,000 for the next five years. Annual outlays are reimbursed by the existing reclamation bond and reimbursements are expected to approximate the actual outlays. In August 2016, the Company&#8217;s mine closure plan and existing plan was determined to be sufficient by the BLM.

EMPLOYEES

As of June 30, 2016 we employed six employees, all of whom are full-time, and one consultant.

FACILITIES

Our principal office is located at 665 Anderson Street, 89445, Winnemucca, Nevada.
