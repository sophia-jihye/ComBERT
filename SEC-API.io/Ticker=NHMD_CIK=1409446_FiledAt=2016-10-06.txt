As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; mean Nate&#8217;s Food Co., unless otherwise indicated.

&#160;

General Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on January 12, 2000 under the name Capital Resources Alliance, Inc. At inception, we were a development stage company in the business of mining and exploration. On May 19, 2014 our company completed a reverse merger with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes, Inc., an Indiana company, with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes being the surviving entity. In May 2014, we changed our name from Capital Resource Alliance, Inc. to Nate&#8217;s Food Co.

&#160;

In connection with the reverse merger, we became a food manufacturing and product company, and in May 2014, we executed a licensing agreement with Nate&#8217;s Pancakes to market and sell &#8220;Nate&#8217;s Homemade&#8221;, exclusively throughout the world.

&#160;

Emerging Growth Company Status 

&#160;

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, commonly referred to as the JOBS Act. We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.

&#160; &#160; 3 

&#160;

As an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to:

&#160;

&#183; not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (we also will not be subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section404(b) as long as we are a &#8220;smaller reporting company,&#8221; which includes issuers that had a public float of less than $ 75 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter); &#160;

&#160;

&#183; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

&#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Under this provision, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of such accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies until the first to occur of the date the subject company (i) is no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B). Our company has elected to take advantage of this extended transition period and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies. Accordingly, until the date that we are no longer an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; or affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the exemption provided by Securities Act Section 7(a) (2) (B), upon the issuance of a new or revised accounting standard that applies to your financial statements and has a different effective date for public and private companies, clarify that we will disclose the date on which adoption is required for non-emerging growth companies and the date on which we will adopt the recently issued accounting standard.

&#160;

Our Current Business 

&#160;

We are a food manufacturing and product company that manufactures, distributes and sells ready-to-use, pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter. We hold a 20 year worldwide exclusive license agreement for Nate&#8217;s Homemade. 

&#160;

On August 23, 2016, we entered in to an arrangement with one of California's largest aerosol producers to begin pilot production runs of Nate's Homemade Pancake and Waffle Batter in order to start supplying Southern California grocery stores. This will enable our company to expand our current online sales activity to include distribution to regional grocery chains without impacting our ongoing development activities with ABCO Laboratories Inc. in Northern California.

&#160;

License Agreement 

&#160;

Term 

&#160;

The license agreement is for a term of twenty (20) years. Our company has the right to renew the license agreement for successive ten (10) year period by paying $1,000,000 for each new term. 

&#160;

Payments/Royalty 

&#160;

Our company shall pay a royalty equal to Three Percent (3%) of the Gross Revenue from the licensed products. Gross revenue is defined as total revenue minus discounts and allowances. The license requires that we pay a minimum monthly fee of $7,500 beginning twelve (12) months from the execution of the license agreement (June 1, 2015) which is against the 3% royalty.

&#160;

Our company also has the option, at our election, to purchase the intellectual property associated to the license agreement. The buy-out amount is equal to revenue for the 12 months immediately prior to the buy-out.

Our Product 

&#160;

Through Nate&#8217;s Homemade we sell a ready-to-use, pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a pressurized can. Our current product is an original flavor of pancake and waffle batter. We are currently in the process of developing additional flavors and products with the goal to have 10 products in development in 2017. Currently, we have developed three flavors for our pancake and waffle mix. We plan to continue to expand into other baked goods and other non-breakfast areas.

&#160;

Our Customers 

&#160;

We sell our products across the United States to a variety of customers through our online store. 

&#160;

We have delivered samples and will continue to deliver samples of our products to retail chains such as Wal-Mart, Target, Sam&#8217;s Club, Costco, Kroger, BJ&#8217;s and Albertson&#8217;s and in retail stores and evaluate their interest of our product.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

To date, our sales have primarily been through our online store at www.nateshomemade.com. We continue presenting the product and providing samples to distributors and retailers. We have prepared several advertisements for placement in various grocery industry related journals and magazines, but we have not begun placement yet. We anticipate an increase in marketing activity in the 4 th quarter, 2016.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Distribution 

&#160;

Raw materials used in our products include cans, valves, caps, flour and other commodities. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain the ingredients and packaging we need for production. Although the prices of our principal raw materials may fluctuate based on adverse weather, the economy, and other conditions, we believe such raw materials to be generally available from numerous sources. 

&#160;

We currently utilize one production facility in the United States which manufactures and distributes our products. 

&#160; &#160; 5 

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Sales of our products are generally evenly distributed throughout the year.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We operate in a highly competitive environment. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including manufacturers of private label products, as well as manufacturers of other branded food products, which compete for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. We compete with large conventional consumer packaged foods companies. We also compete with natural and organic consumer packaged foods companies. At present, there are no other companies manufacturing or distributing aerosol delivered pancake and waffle batters.

&#160;

Competitive factors in our industry include product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, product variety and ingredients, product packaging and package design, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and our ability to identify and satisfy consumer tastes and preferences.

&#160;

Compliance with Government Regulation 

&#160;

Food-Related Regulations 

&#160;

As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to a number of food-related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging, and safety of food in the United States. The FDA:

&#160;

&#183; 

regulates holding, distribution and manufacturing practices for food ingredients and foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations and periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to audit compliance; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. 

&#160;

In March 2014, the FDA issued a proposed rule that would make significant changes to the information appearing in, and the format of, the nutrition facts appearing on food labels. In July 2015, the FDA issued a supplemental proposed rule to establish a reference value for added sugars and to require a declaration of the percent daily value of added sugars on the food label. The proposed rule would also revise the footnote in the nutrition label regarding the percent daily value. It is not clear whether FDA will issue final regulation or, if it does, how much time FDA will give food manufactures to bring their labels into compliance.

&#160;

In addition, the FDA enforces the Public Health Service Act and regulations issued thereunder, which authorizes regulatory activity necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases. These regulations require, for example, pasteurization of milk and milk products. The FDA also is implementing the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 ("FSMA") which, among other things, mandates that the FDA adopt preventive controls to be implemented by farms, warehouses, food facilities and transporters in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. 

&#160;

In September 2015, FDA released final rules implementing the Produce Safety and Current Good Manufacturing Practices, Hazard Analysis and Risk Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) requirements for human food and animal food, which was a major milestone in the implementation of FSMA. The final rules revise the FDA&#8217;s food safety regulations by: (1) codifying good agricultural practices and water fertilizer action limits, (2) updating and revising certain requirements in the existing current good manufacturing practices regulations (current 21 CFR Part 110), (3) requiring the establishment and implementation of a food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and risk-based preventive controls and sets requirements for a written food safety plan, and (4) adding new requirements for a risk-based end-to-end supply chain program. Compliance is required by September 19, 2016, with respect to the new good manufacturing practices and HARPC regulations, and by January 2017, with respect to the new produce safety rules.

&#160; &#160; 6 

&#160;

We are subject to numerous other federal, state, and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. In response to food-borne illness events, FDA scrutiny of the food and beverage industry has increased over the past few years, which has required food and beverage companies to dedicate additional resources to the areas regulated by the FDA.

&#160;

Labeling Regulations 

&#160;

We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, the FDA has authority to review product labeling, and the Federal Trade Commission may review labeling and advertising materials, including online and television advertisements to determine if advertising materials are misleading. Similarly, many states review dairy product labels to determine whether they comply with applicable state laws. In addition, the European Union has issued and enforces rules governing foodstuff labeling, nutrition, and health claims. We believe we are in material compliance with all labeling laws and regulations applicable to our business.

&#160;

We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We have incurred $107,082 in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We currently have the exclusive license to all intellectual property held by IPC, Inc., the Patent filed by Nate Steck for delivery of pancake and waffle batter contained in an aerosol can, as well as the our domain names and websites, www.natesfoodco.com and www.nateshomemade.com.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

Other than our directors and officers, who provide their services to our company and independent consultants, we have no full time employees.
