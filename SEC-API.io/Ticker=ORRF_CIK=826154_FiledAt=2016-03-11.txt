 ITEM 1 &#8211; BUSINESS 

Orrstown Financial Services, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Pennsylvania corporation, is the holding company for Orrstown Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s executive offices are located at 77 East King Street, Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, 17257. The Company was organized on November 17, 1987, for the purpose of acquiring the Bank and such other banks and bank related activities as are permitted by law and desirable. The Bank provides banking and bank related services through 22 &#32;offices, located in South Central Pennsylvania, principally in Cumberland, Franklin, Lancaster and Perry Counties and in Washington County, Maryland. 

The Company files periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) in the form of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K, annual proxy statements and current reports on Form 8-K for any significant events that may arise during the year. Copies of these reports, and any amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), may be obtained free of charge through the SEC&#8217;s internet site at www.sec.gov &#32;or by accessing the Company&#8217;s website at www.orrstown.com &#32;as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Information on our website shall not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. 

Business 

The Bank was originally organized in 1919 as a state-chartered bank. On March 8, 1988, in a bank holding company reorganization transaction, the Company acquired 100% ownership of the Bank, issuing 131,455 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to the former shareholders of the Bank. 

The Company&#8217;s primary activity consists of owning and supervising its subsidiary, the Bank. The day-to-day management of the Company is conducted by its officers, who are also Bank officers. The Company has historically derived most of its income through dividends from the Bank. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company, on a consolidated basis, had total assets of $1,292,816,000 , total shareholders&#8217; equity of $133,061,000 &#32;and total deposits of $1,032,167,000 . 

The Company has no employees. Its seven &#32;officers are employees of the Bank. On December 31, 2015 , the Bank had 294 &#32;full-time and 12 &#32;part-time employees. 

The Bank is engaged in commercial banking and trust business as authorized by the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965. This involves accepting demand, time and savings deposits, and granting loans. The Bank grants commercial, residential, consumer and agribusiness loans in its market areas of Cumberland, Franklin, Lancaster and Perry Counties in Pennsylvania, Washington County, Maryland, and in contiguous counties. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 4, &#8220;Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; filed herewith in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; The Bank maintains a diversified loan portfolio and evaluates each customer&#8217;s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon the extension of credit, is based on management&#8217;s credit evaluation of the customer pursuant to collateral standards established in the Bank&#8217;s credit policies and procedures. 

Lending 

All secured loans are supported with appraisals or evaluations of collateral. Business equipment and machinery, inventories, accounts receivable, and farm equipment are considered appropriate security, provided they meet acceptable standards for liquidity and marketability. Loans secured by real estate generally do not exceed 90% of the appraised value of the property. Loan to collateral values are monitored as part of the loan review process, and appraisals are updated as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. 

Commercial Lending 

A majority of the Company&#8217;s loan assets are loans for business purposes. Approximately 59% of the loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans. The Bank makes commercial real estate, equipment, working capital and other commercial purpose loans as required by the broad range of borrowers across the Bank&#8217;s various markets. 

The Bank&#8217;s credit policy dictates the underwriting requirements for the various types of loans the Bank would extend to borrowers. The policy covers such requirements as debt coverage ratios, advance rate against different forms of collateral, loan-to-value ratios (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) and maximum term. 

&#32;2 

Consumer Lending 

The Bank provides home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans primarily through its branch network and customer call center. A large majority of the consumer loans are secured by either a first or second lien position on the borrower&#8217;s primary residential real estate. The Bank requires a LTV of no greater than 90% of the value of the real estate being taken as collateral. The Bank&#8217;s underwriting standards typically require that a borrower&#8217;s debt to income ratio generally cannot exceed 43%. 

Residential Lending 

The Bank provides residential mortgages throughout its various markets through a network of mortgage loan officers. A majority of the residential mortgages originated are sold to secondary market investors, primarily Wells Fargo, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. All mortgages, regardless of being sold or held in the Bank&#8217;s portfolio, are generally underwritten to secondary market industry standards for prime mortgages. The Bank generally requires a LTV of no greater than 80% of the value of the real estate being taken as collateral, without the borrower obtaining private mortgage insurance. 

Loan Review 

The Bank has a loan review policy and program which is designed to identify and mitigate risk in the lending function. The Enterprise Risk Management (&#8220;ERM&#8221;) Committee, comprised of executive officers and loan department personnel, is charged with the oversight of overall credit quality and risk exposure of the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio. This includes the monitoring of the lending activities of all Bank personnel with respect to underwriting and processing new loans and the timely follow-up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality. The loan review program provides the Bank with an independent review of the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio on an ongoing basis. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as extended delinquencies, bankruptcy, repossession, or death of the borrower occurs, which heightens awareness as to a possible negative credit event. 

Internal loan relationship reviews are completed annually on all commercial relationships with a committed loan balance in excess of $500,000, which include a confirmation of the risk rating by the appropriate credit authority, including Credit Administration for loans in excess of $1,000,000. In addition, all relationships greater than $250,000 rated Substandard, Doubtful or Loss are reviewed by the ERM Committee on a quarterly basis, with reaffirmation of the rating as approved by the Bank&#8217;s Loan Work Out Committee. 

The Bank outsources its independent loan review to a third-party provider, which monitors and evaluates loan customers on a quarterly basis utilizing risk-rating criteria established in the credit policy in order to identify deteriorating trends and detect conditions which might indicate potential problem loans. The third-party loan review firm reports the results of the loan reviews quarterly to the ERM Committee for approval. The loan ratings provide the basis for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. 

Orrstown Financial Advisors (&#8220;OFA&#8221;) 

Through its trust department, the Bank renders services as trustee, executor, administrator, guardian, managing agent, custodian, investment advisor, and other fiduciary activities authorized by law under the trade name &#8220;Orrstown Financial Advisors.&#8221; OFA offers retail brokerage services through a third-party broker/dealer arrangement with Cetera Advisor Networks LLC. As of December 31, 2015 , trust assets under management were $966,362,000 . 

Regulation and Supervision 

The Company is a bank holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;FRB&#8221;) and has elected status as a financial holding company. As a registered bank holding company and financial holding company, the Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;) and to inspection, examination, and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Bank&#8221;). 

The Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered commercial bank and a member of the FRB. As such, the operations of the Bank are subject to federal and state statutes applicable to banks chartered under Pennsylvania law, to FRB member banks and to banks whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The Bank&#8217;s operations are also subject to regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (&#8220;PDB&#8221;), the FRB and the FDIC. 

&#32;3 

Several of the more significant regulatory provisions applicable to banks and bank holding companies to which the Company and the Bank are subject are discussed below, along with certain regulatory matters concerning the Company and the Bank. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, such information is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutes or regulations. Any change in applicable law or regulation may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank. 

Financial and Bank Holding Company Activities 

In general, the BHC Act and the FRB&#8217;s regulations limit the nonbanking activities permissible for bank holding companies to those activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. A bank holding company that elects to be treated as a financial holding company, such as the Company, however, may engage in, and acquire companies engaged in, activities that are considered &#8220;financial in nature,&#8221; as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and FRB regulations. For a bank holding company to be eligible to elect financial holding company status, the holding company must be both &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable regulatory standards and all of its subsidiary banks must be &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed&#8221; and must have received at least a satisfactory rating on such institution&#8217;s most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;). A financial holding company that continues to meet all of such requirements may engage directly or indirectly in activities considered financial in nature, either de novo or by acquisition, as long as it gives the FRB after-the-fact notice of the new activities. If a financial holding company fails to continue to meet any of the prerequisites for financial holding company status after engaging in activities not permissible for bank holding companies that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies, the company must enter into an agreement with the FRB that it will comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. If the financial holding company does not return to compliance within 180 days, or such longer period as agreed to by the FRB, the FRB may order the company to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies or divest the company&#8217;s investments in companies engaged in such activities. In addition, if any banking subsidiary of a financial holding company receives a CRA rating of less than satisfactory, the company would be prohibited from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. 

FDIC Insurance and Assessments 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), the maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000. 

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution&#8217;s ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios. Within its risk category, an institution is assigned an initial base assessment which is then adjusted to determine its final assessment rate based on its level of brokered deposits, secured liabilities and unsecured debt. 

The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to take such steps as necessary to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020. In setting the assessments, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments so that assessments will be based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital of a financial institution rather than on its insured deposits. The FDIC has adopted a restoration plan to increase the reserve ratio to 1.15% by September 30, 2020 with additional rulemaking scheduled regarding the method to be used to achieve a 1.35% reserve ratio by that date and offset the effect on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. 

Pursuant to these requirements, the FDIC adopted new assessment regulations effective April 1, 2011 that redefined the assessment base as average consolidated assets less average tangible equity. Insured banks with more than $1.0 billion in assets must calculate quarterly average assets based on daily balances while smaller banks and newly chartered banks may use weekly averages. Average assets would be reduced by goodwill and other intangibles. Average tangible equity equals Tier 1 capital. For institutions with more than $1.0 billion in assets, average tangible equity is calculated on a weekly basis while smaller institutions may use the quarter-end balance. The base assessment rate for insured institutions in Risk Category I will range from 5 to 9 basis points and for institutions in Risk Categories II, III, and IV will be 14, 23 and 35 basis points. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate will be reduced based on the amount of its outstanding unsecured long-term debt and for institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV may be increased based on their brokered deposits. In addition, under the FDIC&#8217;s 2011 insurance assessment regulation, a schedule of lower assessment rates will go into effect the quarter after the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, which the FDIC projects will be the first or second quarter of 2016. 

&#32;4 

The FDIC has proposed to amend its assessment regulations for established banks (generally, an institution that has been federally insured for at least five years as of the last day of any quarter for which it is being assessed) with less than $10 billion in assets to replace the current risk categories with updated financial ratios that are designed to better predict the risk of failure of insured institutions. The proposed rules would not become effective until the designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches 1.15% and would remain in effect until the designated reserve ratio reaches 2.0%. The proposed regulations would set a maximum rate that banks rated CAMELS 1 or 2 could be charged and a minimum rate that CAMELS 3, 4 and 5 banks would be charged. Under the proposal, the FDIC would use a bank&#8217;s weighted average CAMELS component ratings and the following financial measures to determine assessments: Tier 1 leverage ratio; ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; ratio of non-performing loans to gross assets; and ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets. In addition, assessments would take into consideration core deposits to total assets, one-year asset growth and a loan mix index. The loan mix index would measure the extent to which a bank&#8217;s total assets include higher risk loans. To calculate the loan mix index, each category of loans in the bank&#8217;s portfolio (other than credit card loans) would be divided by the bank&#8217;s total assets to determine the percentage of assets represented by that loan category. Each percentage would then be multiplied by that loan category&#8217;s historical weighted average industry-wide charge-off rate. The sum of these numbers would determine the loan mix index value for that bank. The FDIC proposal is intended to be revenue neutral to the FDIC but to shift premium payments to higher risk institutions. Most institutions are expected to see lower premiums. A companion proposal would assess banks over $10 billion in assets at higher rates for two years in accordance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

Liability for Banking Subsidiaries 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable FRB policy, a bank holding company such as the Company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to their support. This support may be required at times when the bank holding company may not have the resources to provide it. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;), the FDIC can hold any FDIC-insured depository institution liable for any loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with (1) the &#8220;default&#8221; of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution; or (2) any assistance provided by the FDIC to a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution &#8220;in danger of default.&#8221; 

Pennsylvania Banking Law 

The Pennsylvania Banking Code (&#8220;Banking Code&#8221;) contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, and employees, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rule-making power and administrative discretion to the PDB so that the supervision and regulation of state chartered banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. 

The FDIA, however, prohibits state chartered banks from making new investments, loans, or becoming involved in activities as principal and equity investments which are not permitted for national banks unless (1) the FDIC determines the activity or investment does not pose a significant risk of loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund and (2) the bank meets all applicable capital requirements. Accordingly, the additional operating authority provided to the Bank by the Banking Code is significantly restricted by the FDIA. 

Dividend Restrictions 

The Company&#8217;s funding for cash distributions to its shareholders is derived from a variety of sources, including cash and temporary investments. One of the principal sources of those funds has historically been dividends received from the Bank. Various federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Company without regulatory approval. In addition, federal bank regulatory agencies have authority to prohibit the Bank from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. The payment of dividends, depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends in the future may be influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

Information concerning the compliance of the Company and the Bank with respect to capital requirements is incorporated by reference from Note 14, &#8220;Shareholders&#8217; Equity and Regulatory Capital,&#8221; of the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; included under Item 8 of this report, and from the &#8220;Capital Adequacy and Regulatory Matters&#8221; section of the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; included under Item 7 of this report. 

&#32;5 

Basel III Capital Rules 

Effective January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to the Basel III Capital Rules, which substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements in comparison to the previously effective U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduced a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) increased the minimum requirements for Tier 1 Capital ratio as well as the minimum levels to be considered well capitalized under prompt corrective action; (iii) and introduced the "capital conservation buffer&#8221;, designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer are subject to constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. 

Under the previously effective capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are generally included in the calculation of CET1 and thus of Tier 1 capital. However, banking organizations were given a one-time option to permanently opt out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI, including unrealized gains or losses on certain securities available for sale, in CET1. The Company and Bank made the one-time permanent election to opt out, with the result that most AOCI items will be treated for regulatory capital purposes in the same manner in which they were under the previously effective capital rules. 

The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. 

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter until fully phased-in at January 1, 2018). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require the Company and Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. 

The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer are subject to constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. 

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios effective as of January 1, 2015 are as follows: &#160; 

&#8226; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#8226; 

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average assets. 

With respect to the Bank, the Basel III Capital Rules also revise the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the previous 6%), and (iii) eliminating the provision of the former regulation that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The Basel III Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category. 

&#32;6 

The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expands the risk-weighting categories from the four categories of the previous capital standards (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. Significant changes to the previously effective capital rules that will impact the Company&#8217;s determination of risk-weighted assets include, among other things: &#160; 

&#8226; 

Greater restrictions on the amount of deferred tax assets that can be included in CET1 capital with assets relating to net operating loss and credit carry forwards being excluded, and a 10% - 15% limitation on deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that cannot be realized through net operating loss carry backs. 

&#8226; 

Applying a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, compared to 100% risk weight previously in place; 

&#8226; 

Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due or in nonaccrual status, compared to 100% risk weight previously in place; and 

&#8226; 

Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable, compared to 0% previously in place. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Dodd-Frank Act created an independent regulatory body, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;Bureau&#8221;), with authority and responsibility to set rules and regulations for most consumer protection laws applicable to all banks, including the Company. The Bureau has responsibility for mortgage reform and enforcement, as well as broad new powers over consumer financial activities which could impact what consumer financial services would be available and how they are provided. 

In late 2012, the Bureau formed a Community Bank Advisory Council. Representatives were drawn from small-to-medium-sized community banks to engage in discussions on how smaller institutions help level the playing field for consumers experiencing difficulty in managing their money and what opportunities and challenges exist in mortgage lending for small institutions. The Bureau has developed prototype designs for various disclosures and agreements and invited the public and financial industry to review and comment on what works. Their website (www.consumerfinance.gov) serves as a public information resource on laws and regulations, provides assistance with financial questions, invites participation with projects or initiatives, and serves as a resource for submission of complaints. The Bureau has positioned itself to serve as a resource for submission of complaints and to provide help to consumers with complaints regarding credit cards, mortgages, student loans, checking accounts, savings accounts, credit reporting, bank services, and other consumer loans. Guidance and consumer tips on various financial topics have been issued since 2012 in blogs on the Bureau&#8217;s website. 

Significant final mortgage rules were issued by the Bureau in January 2013, most with mandatory effective dates in January 2014. These rules were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act provisions enacted in response to the breakdown in the mortgage lending markets and to provide for consumer protections. The following rules are intended to address problems consumers face in the three major steps in buying a home &#8211; shopping for a mortgage, closing on a mortgage, and paying off a mortgage. 

Ability-to-Repay (&#8220;ATR&#8221;) and Qualified Mortgage (&#8220;QM&#8221;) rules were designed to address concerns that residential mortgage borrowers received loans for which they had no ability to repay. The ATR final rule requires a creditor to make &#8220;a reasonable and good faith determination at or before closing that the consumer will have a reasonable ability, at the time of consummation, to repay the loan, according to its terms, including any mortgage-related obligations.&#8221; The ATR standards require consideration of eight specific underwriting factors. Information used must be documented and verified using reasonably reliable third-party records. The ATR rule provides for a wide variety of documents and sources of information that can be used and relied on to determine ATR. In addition, the ATR rules included provisions that create a legal advantage for lenders for loans that are qualified mortgages. A QM must have a fully amortizing payment, have a term of 30 years or less, and not have points and fees that exceed certain thresholds depending on the total loan amount. Safe Harbor QM loans are lower priced loans that meet QM requirements. Loans satisfying the QM requirements will be entitled to liability protection from damage claims and defenses by borrowers based on an asserted failure to meet ATR requirements. Rebuttable Presumption QM loans are higher-priced loans that meet QM requirements and provide liability protection to a lesser degree from damage claims and defense by borrowers based on asserted failure to meet ATR requirements. 

In November 2013, the Bureau issued a final rule on integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, compliance with which was required by October 3, 2015. The Bank has devoted significant resources to implement the changes required to comply with the new disclosure requirements. 

&#32;7 

Loan servicing has become a key focus, especially when loan workouts and modifications are involved. New mortgage servicing rules effective in January 2014 implement new provisions regarding servicing standards. These new standards seek to ensure similar borrowers who default or become delinquent are treated in a similar, consistent manner. The Bank presently services 5,000 or fewer mortgage loans which it owns or originated, so it is considered a &#8220;Small Servicer&#8221; and is exempt from certain parts of the Mortgage Servicing Rules. The mortgage servicing requirements applicable to the Bank&#8217;s servicing operations under the new mortgage servicing rules are as follows: 1) adjustable rate mortgage interest rate adjustment notices; 2) prompt payment crediting and payoff statements; 3) limits on force-placed insurance; 4) responses to written information requests and complaints of errors; and 5) loss mitigation with regard to the first notice or filing for a foreclosure and no foreclosure proceedings if a borrower is performing pursuant to the terms of a loss mitigation agreement. 

Other Federal Laws and Regulations 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to additional federal laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions, including, without limitation: &#160; 

&#8226; 

Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, which require us to maintain privacy policies intended to safeguard customer financial information, to disclose the policies to our customers and to allow customers to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of having their financial service providers disclose their confidential financial information to non-affiliated third parties, subject to certain exceptions; 

&#8226; 

Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

&#8226; 

Consumer protection rules for the sale of insurance products by depository institutions, adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; and the 

&#8226; 

USA PATRIOT Act, which requires financial institutions to take certain actions to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. 

Future Legislation and Regulation 

Changes to the laws and regulations in the states where the Company and the Bank do business can affect the operating environment of both the Company and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. The Company cannot accurately predict whether those changes in laws and regulations will occur, and, if those changes occur, the ultimate effect they would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. This is also true of federal legislation. 

NASDAQ Capital Market 

The Company&#8217;s common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol &#8220;ORRF&#8221; and is subject to NASDAQ&#8217;s rules for listed companies.

The Bank&#8217;s principal market area consists of Cumberland County, Franklin County, Lancaster County, and Perry County, Pennsylvania, and Washington County, Maryland. The Bank services a substantial number of depositors in this market area and contiguous counties, with the greatest concentration in Chambersburg, Shippensburg, and Carlisle, Pennsylvania and the surrounding areas. 

The Bank, like other depository institutions, has been subjected to competition from less heavily regulated entities such as credit unions, brokerage firms, money market funds, consumer finance and credit card companies, and other commercial banks, many of which are larger than the Bank. The principal methods of competing effectively in the financial services industry include improving customer service through the quality and range of services provided, improving efficiencies and pricing services competitively. The Bank is competitive with the financial institutions in its service areas with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans.

We analyze each of our products and businesses in the context of shareholder return, customer demands, competitive advantages, industry dynamics, and growth potential.
