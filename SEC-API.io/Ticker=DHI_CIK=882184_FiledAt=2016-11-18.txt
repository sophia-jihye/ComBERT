 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

D.R. Horton, Inc. is the largest homebuilding company in the United States as measured by number of homes closed and revenues. We construct and sell homes through our operating divisions in 78 &#32;markets in 26 &#32;states, under the names of D.R. Horton, America&#8217;s Builder , Emerald Homes, Express Homes, Freedom Homes and Pacific Ridge Homes. Our common stock is included in the S&#38;P 500 Index and listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;DHI.&#8221; Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;D.R. Horton,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; used herein refer to D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries. 

Our homebuilding business began in 1978 in Fort Worth, Texas, and our common stock has been publicly traded since 1992. We have expanded and diversified our homebuilding operations geographically over the years by investing available capital into our existing markets, start-up operations in new markets and acquisitions of other homebuilding companies. Our product offerings across our operating markets are broad and diverse. Our homes range in size from 1,000 &#32;to more than 4,000 square feet and in price from $100,000 &#32;to more than $1,000,000 . For the year ended September 30, 2016 , we closed 40,309 &#32;homes with an average closing price of $292,300 . 

Our business operations consist of homebuilding, financial services and other activities. Our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business, comprising 98% &#32;of consolidated revenues, which totaled $12.2 billion &#32;in fiscal 2016 . Our homebuilding operations generate most of their revenues from the sale of completed homes, with a lesser amount from the sale of land and lots. Approximately 89% &#32;of our home sales revenues in fiscal 2016 &#32;were generated from the sale of single-family detached homes, with the remainder from the sale of attached homes, such as town homes, duplexes, triplexes and condominiums. At September 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , we owned approximately 500 &#32;attached residential rental homes. 

Our financial services operations provide mortgage financing and title agency services to homebuyers in many of our homebuilding markets. DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary, provides mortgage financing services primarily to our homebuyers and generally sells the mortgages it originates and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. DHI Mortgage originates loans in accordance with purchaser guidelines and sells substantially all of its mortgage production shortly after origination. Our subsidiary title companies serve as title insurance agents by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services, primarily to our homebuyers. 

In addition to our core homebuilding and financial services operations, we have subsidiaries that engage in other business activities. These subsidiaries conduct insurance-related operations, construct and own income-producing rental properties, own non-residential real estate including ranch land and improvements and own and operate oil and gas related assets. At September 30, 2016 , assets totaling $54.9 million &#32;associated with these subsidiaries were included in the financial services and other section of our balance sheet.

OPERATING STRUCTURE AND PROCESSES 

Following is an overview of our Company&#8217;s operating structure and the significant processes that support our business controls, strategies and performance. 

Homebuilding Markets 

Our homebuilding business began in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, which is still one of our largest homebuilding operations and home to our corporate headquarters. We currently operate in 26 states and 78 &#32;markets, which provides us with geographic diversification in our homebuilding inventory investments and our sources of revenues and earnings. We believe our geographic diversification lowers our operational risks by mitigating the effects of local and regional economic cycles, and it also enhances our earnings potential by providing more diverse opportunities to invest in our business. 

We conduct our homebuilding operations in the geographic regions, states and markets listed below, and we conduct our mortgage and title operations in many of these markets. Our homebuilding operating divisions are aggregated into six &#32;reporting segments, also referred to as reporting regions, which comprise the markets below. Our financial statements contain additional information regarding segment performance.

When evaluating new or existing homebuilding markets for purposes of capital allocation, we consider local, market-specific factors, including among others: 

&#8226; 

Economic conditions; 

&#8226; 

Employment levels and job growth; 

&#8226; 

Income level of potential homebuyers; 

&#8226; 

Local housing affordability and typical mortgage products utilized; 

&#8226; 

Market for homes at our targeted price points; 

&#8226; 

Availability of land and lots in desirable locations on acceptable terms; 

&#8226; 

Land entitlement and development processes; 

&#8226; 

Availability of qualified subcontractors; 

&#8226; 

New and secondary home sales activity; 

&#8226; 

Competition; and 

&#8226; 

Prevailing housing products, features, cost and pricing. 

Economies of Scale 

We are the largest homebuilding company in the United States in fiscal 2016 &#32;as measured by number of homes closed and revenues, and we are also one of the largest builders in many of the markets in which we operate. We believe that our national, regional and local scale of operations provides us with benefits that may not be available to the same degree to some other smaller homebuilders, such as: 

&#8226; 

Greater access to and lower cost of capital, due to our balance sheet strength and our lending and capital markets relationships; 

&#8226; 

Negotiation of volume discounts and rebates from national, regional and local materials suppliers and lower labor rates from certain subcontractors; and 

&#8226; 

Enhanced leverage of our general and administrative activities, which allows us flexibility to adjust to changes in market conditions and compete effectively in each of our markets. 

Decentralized Homebuilding Operations 

We view homebuilding as a local business; therefore, most of our direct homebuilding activities are decentralized to provide flexibility to our local managers on operational decisions. We believe that our local management teams, who are familiar with local conditions, have the best information on which to base many decisions regarding their operations. At September 30, 2016 , we had 39 &#32;separate homebuilding operating divisions, many of which operate in more than one market area. Generally, each operating division consists of a division president; a controller; land entitlement, acquisition and development personnel; a sales manager and sales and marketing personnel; a construction manager and construction superintendents; customer service personnel; a purchasing manager and office staff. Our division presidents receive performance based compensation if they achieve targeted financial and operating metrics related to their operating divisions. Following is a summary of our homebuilding activities that are decentralized in our local operating divisions, and the control and oversight functions that are centralized in our regional and corporate offices: 

Operating Division Responsibilities 

Each operating division is responsible for: 

&#8226; 

Site selection, which involves 

&#8212; A feasibility study; 

&#8212; Soil and environmental reviews; 

&#8212; Review of existing zoning and other governmental requirements; 

&#8212; Review of the need for and extent of offsite work required to obtain project entitlements; and 

&#8212; Financial analysis of the potential project; 

&#8226; 

Negotiating lot option, land acquisition and related contracts; 

&#8226; 

Obtaining all necessary land development and home construction approvals; 

&#8226; 

Selecting land development subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes; 

&#8226; 

Selecting building plans and architectural schemes; 

&#8226; 

Selecting construction subcontractors and ensuring their work meets our contracted scopes; 

&#8226; 

Planning and managing homebuilding schedules; 

&#8226; 

Developing and implementing local marketing and sales plans; 

&#8226; 

Determining the pricing for each house plan and options in a given community; and 

&#8226; 

Coordinating post-closing customer service and warranty repairs. 

Centralized Controls 

We centralize many important risk elements of our homebuilding business through our regional and corporate offices. We have five separate homebuilding regional offices. Generally, each regional office consists of a region president, legal counsel, a chief financial officer and limited office support staff. Each of our region presidents and their management teams are responsible for oversight of the operations of a number of homebuilding operating divisions, including: 

&#8226; 

Review and approval of division business plans and budgets; 

&#8226; 

Review of all land and lot acquisition contracts; 

&#8226; 

Review of all business and financial analysis for potential land and lot inventory investments; 

&#8226; 

Oversight of land and home inventory levels; 

&#8226; 

Monitoring division financial and operating performance; and 

&#8226; 

Review of major personnel decisions and division incentive compensation plans. 

Our corporate executives and corporate office departments are responsible for establishing our operational policies and internal control standards and for monitoring compliance with established policies and controls throughout our operations. The corporate office also has primary responsibility for direct management of certain key risk elements and initiatives through the following centralized functions: 

&#8226; 

Financing; 

&#8226; 

Cash management; 

&#8226; 

Allocation of capital; 

&#8226; 

Issuance and monitoring of inventory investment guidelines; 

&#8226; 

Approval and funding of land and lot acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

Monitoring and analysis of profitability, returns, costs and inventory levels; 

&#8226; 

Risk and litigation management; 

&#8226; 

Environmental assessments of land and lot acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

Technology systems to support management of operations, marketing and information; 

&#8226; 

Accounting and management reporting; 

&#8226; 

Income taxes; 

&#8226; 

Internal audit; 

&#8226; 

Public reporting and investor and media relations; 

&#8226; 

Administration of payroll and employee benefits; 

&#8226; 

Negotiation of national purchasing contracts; 

&#8226; 

Administration of customer satisfaction surveys and reporting of results; and 

&#8226; 

Approval of major personnel decisions and management incentive compensation plans. 

Land/Lot Acquisition and Inventory Management 

We acquire land for use in our homebuilding operations after we have completed due diligence and generally after we have obtained the rights (known as entitlements) to begin development or construction work resulting in an acceptable number of residential lots. Before we acquire lots or tracts of land, we complete a feasibility study, which includes soil tests, independent environmental studies, other engineering work and financial analysis. We also evaluate the status of necessary zoning and other governmental entitlements required to develop and use the property for home construction. Although we purchase and develop land primarily to support our homebuilding activities, we may sell land and lots to other developers and homebuilders where we have excess land and lot positions. 

We also enter into land/lot option contracts, in which we obtain the right, but generally not the obligation, to buy land or lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with anticipated home closings or planned development. Our option contracts generally are non-recourse, which limits our financial exposure to our earnest money deposited into escrow under the terms of the contract and any pre-acquisition due diligence costs we incur. This enables us to control land and lot positions with limited capital investment, which substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development. 

We directly acquire almost all of our land and lot positions. We are a party to a small number of joint ventures, all of which are consolidated in our financial statements. 

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to real estate inventory risks by: 

&#8226; 

Managing our supply of land/lots controlled (owned and optioned) in each market based on anticipated future home closing levels; 

&#8226; 

Monitoring local market and demographic trends, housing preferences and related economic developments, including the identification of desirable housing submarkets based on the quality of local schools, new job opportunities, local growth initiatives and personal income trends; 

&#8226; 

Utilizing land/lot option contracts, where possible; 

&#8226; 

Seeking to acquire developed lots which are substantially ready for home construction, where possible; 

&#8226; 

Controlling our levels of investment in land acquisition, land development and housing inventory to match the expected housing demand in each of our operating markets; and 

&#8226; 

Monitoring and managing the number of speculative homes (homes under construction without an executed sales contract) built in each subdivision. 

Land Development and Home Construction 

Substantially all of our land development and home construction work is performed by subcontractors. Subcontractors typically are selected after a competitive bidding process and are retained for a specific subdivision or series of house plans pursuant to a contract that obligates the subcontractor to complete the scope of work at an agreed-upon price. We employ land development managers and construction superintendents to monitor land development and home construction activities, participate in major design and building decisions, coordinate the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, review the work of subcontractors for quality and cost controls and monitor compliance with zoning and building codes. In addition, our construction superintendents interact with our homebuyers during the construction process and instruct buyers on post-closing home maintenance. 

Our home designs are selected or prepared in each of our markets to appeal to the preferences of local homebuyers in each community. Our local management teams regularly adjust our product offerings to address our customers&#8217; expectations for affordability, home size and features. In most communities, we offer optional interior and exterior features to homebuyers for an additional charge. Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor, materials and supplies, the weather, the size of the home and other factors. We complete the construction of most homes within three &#32;to six months . 

We typically do not maintain significant inventories of land development or construction materials, except for work in progress materials for active development projects and homes under construction. Generally, the construction materials used in our operations are readily available from numerous sources. We have contracts exceeding one year with certain suppliers of building materials that are cancelable at our option. 

We are subject to governmental regulations that affect our land development and construction operations. At times, we have experienced delays in receiving the proper approvals from municipalities or other government agencies that have delayed our anticipated development and construction activities in individual communities. 

Cost Controls 

We control construction costs by designing our homes efficiently and by obtaining competitive bids for construction materials and labor. We also competitively bid and negotiate pricing from our subcontractors and suppliers based on the volume of services and products we purchase on a local, regional and national basis. We monitor our land development expenditures and construction costs versus budgets for each house and community, and we review our inventory levels, margins, expenses, profitability and returns for each operating market compared to both its business plan and our performance expectations. 

We control overhead costs by centralizing certain accounting and administrative functions and by monitoring staffing and compensation levels. We review other general and administrative costs to identify efficiencies and savings opportunities in our operating divisions and our regional and corporate offices. We also direct many of our promotional activities toward local real estate brokers and digital marketing initiatives, which we believe are an efficient use of our marketing expenditures. 

Marketing and Sales 

In most of our markets, we use the D.R. Horton, Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand names to market and sell our homes. Our D.R. Horton branded communities are the core of our business and account for the majority of our home closings, focusing on the first time and first time move-up homebuyer. Our Emerald branded communities appeal to buyers in search of higher-end move-up and luxury homes. Our Express branded communities primarily accommodate a segment of entry-level buyers who are focused on affordability. In fiscal 2016 , homes marketed under our Express Homes brand represented 26% &#32;of our home closings and 18% &#32;of our home sales revenue, and homes marketed under our Emerald Homes brand represented 4% &#32;of our home closings and 9% &#32;of our home sales revenue. 

We also use the Pacific Ridge Homes brand in our Seattle market following our acquisition of their homebuilding operations in fiscal 2015, and their product offerings are similar to our D.R. Horton communities. We introduced our Freedom Homes brand in late fiscal 2016 to offer affordable homes specifically for the active adult buyer seeking a low-maintenance lifestyle in an age-restricted or age-targeted community. 

We market and sell our homes primarily through commissioned employees, and the majority of our home closings also involve an independent real estate broker. We typically conduct home sales from sales offices located in furnished model homes in each subdivision, and we generally do not offer our model homes for sale until the completion of a subdivision. Our sales personnel assist prospective homebuyers by providing floor plans and price information, demonstrating the features and layouts of our homes and assisting with the selection of options. We train and inform our sales personnel as to the availability of financing, construction schedules and marketing and advertising plans. As market conditions warrant, we may provide potential homebuyers with incentives, such as discounts or free upgrades, to be competitive in a particular market. 

We market our homes and communities to prospective homebuyers and real estate brokers through digital media, including email, search engine marketing, social networking sites and our company website, as well as through print media and advertisement. We also use billboards, radio, television, magazine and newspaper advertising as necessary in each local market. We attempt to position our subdivisions in locations that are desirable to potential homebuyers and convenient to or visible from local traffic patterns, which helps to reduce advertising costs. Model homes play a substantial role in our marketing efforts, and we expend significant effort and resources to create an attractive atmosphere in our model homes. 

We also build speculative homes in most of our subdivisions. These homes enhance our marketing and sales efforts to prospective homebuyers who are renters or who are relocating to these markets and require a home within a short time frame, as well as to independent brokers who represent these homebuyers. We determine our speculative homes strategy in each market based on local market factors, such as new job growth, the number of job relocations, housing demand and supply, seasonality, current sales contract cancellation trends and our past experience in the market. We maintain a level of speculative home inventory in each subdivision based on our current and planned sales pace, and we monitor and adjust speculative home inventory on an ongoing basis as conditions warrant. Speculative homes allow us to compete effectively with existing homes available in the market and improve our profits and returns. 

Sales Contracts and Backlog 

Our sales contracts require an earnest money deposit which varies in amount across our markets and subdivisions. Additionally, customers are generally required to pay additional deposits when they select options or upgrade features for their homes. Our sales contracts include a financing contingency which permits customers to cancel and receive a refund of their deposit if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified period. Our contracts may include other contingencies, such as the sale of an existing home. We either retain or refund customer deposits on cancelled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances. 

Sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. At September 30, 2016 , the value of our backlog of sales orders was $3.4 billion &#32;( 11,475 &#32;homes), an increase &#32;of 9% &#32;from $3.1 billion &#32;( 10,662 &#32;homes) at September 30, 2015 . The average sales price of homes in backlog was $299,600 &#32;at September 30, 2016 , up &#32; 2% &#32;from the $295,100 &#32;average at September 30, 2015 . Many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, such as those described above, which can result in cancellations. A portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations. As a percentage of gross sales orders, cancellations of sales contracts were 23% &#32;in both fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 . 

The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer (closing) is generally from two &#32;to six months ; therefore, substantially all of the homes in our sales backlog at September 30, 2016 &#32;are scheduled to close in fiscal year 2017 . Further discussion of our backlog is provided in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; under Part II of this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Customer Service and Quality Control 

Our operating divisions are responsible for pre-closing quality control inspections and responding to customers&#8217; post-closing needs. We believe that a prompt and courteous response to homebuyers&#8217; needs during and after construction reduces post-closing repair costs, enhances our reputation for quality and service and ultimately leads to repeat and referral business from the real estate community and homebuyers. We typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. The subcontractors who perform the actual construction also provide us with warranties on workmanship and are generally prepared to respond to us and the homeowner promptly upon request. In addition, some of our suppliers provide manufacturer&#8217;s warranties on specified products installed in the home. 

Customer Mortgage Financing 

We provide mortgage financing services principally to purchasers of our homes in the majority of our homebuilding markets through DHI Mortgage, our 100% owned subsidiary. DHI Mortgage assists in the sales transaction by coordinating the mortgage application, mortgage commitment and home closing processes to facilitate a timely and efficient home buying experience for our buyers. DHI Mortgage originates mortgage loans for a substantial portion of our homebuyers. During the year ended September 30, 2016 , DHI Mortgage provided mortgage financing services for approximately 55% &#32;of our total homes closed, and approximately 93% &#32;of DHI Mortgage&#8217;s loan volume related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. Most of our homebuilding divisions also work with a number of additional mortgage lenders that offer a range of mortgage financing programs to our homebuyers. 

To limit the risks associated with our mortgage operations, DHI Mortgage originates loan products that we believe can be sold to third-party purchasers of mortgage loans, the majority of which are eligible for sale to the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). DHI Mortgage sells substantially all of the loans and their servicing rights to third-party purchasers shortly after origination with limited recourse provisions. DHI Mortgage centralizes most of its control and oversight functions, including those related to loan underwriting, quality control, regulatory compliance, secondary marketing of loans, hedging activities, accounting and financial reporting. 

Title Services 

Through our subsidiary title companies, we serve as a title insurance agent in selected markets by providing title insurance policies, examination and closing services primarily to our homebuilding customers. We currently assume little or no underwriting risk associated with these title policies. 

Employees 

At September 30, 2016 , we employed 6,976 persons, of whom 1,588 &#32;were sales and marketing personnel, 1,903 &#32;were involved in construction, 1,910 &#32;were office personnel and 1,575 &#32;worked in mortgage and title operations. We focus significant attention toward attracting and retaining talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations, and we believe that we have good relations with our employees. 

Recent Business Acquisitions 

We routinely evaluate opportunities to profitably expand our operations, including potential acquisitions of other homebuilding or related businesses. In April 2015 , we acquired the homebuilding operations of Pacific Ridge Homes, which operates in Seattle, Washington. In September 2016 , we acquired the homebuilding operations of Wilson Parker Homes, which operates in Atlanta and Augusta, Georgia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina and Phoenix, Arizona. 

Acquisitions of homebuilding businesses usually provide us with immediate land and home inventories and control of additional land and lot positions through option contracts. Also, employees of acquired businesses generally have specialized knowledge of local market conditions, including existing relationships with municipalities, land owners, developers, subcontractors and suppliers. These inventory positions and local market knowledge and relationships could take us several years to develop through our own efforts. We seek to limit the risks associated with acquiring other companies by conducting extensive operational, financial and legal due diligence on each acquisition and by performing financial analysis to determine that each acquisition will have a positive impact on our earnings within an acceptable period of time. 

Competition 

The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous other national, regional and local homebuilders for homebuyers, desirable land, raw materials, skilled labor, employees, management talent and financing. We also compete with resales of existing and foreclosed homes and with the rental housing market. Our homes compete on the basis of quality, price, location, design and mortgage financing terms. 

The competitors to our financial services businesses include other title companies and mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. Some of these competitors are subject to fewer governmental regulations and may have greater access to capital than we do, and some of them may operate with different lending criteria and may offer a broader array of financing and other products and services to consumers than we do. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

The homebuilding industry is subject to extensive and complex regulations. We and the subcontractors we use must comply with many federal, state and local laws and regulations. These include zoning, density and development requirements and building, environmental, advertising, labor and real estate sales rules and regulations. These regulations and requirements affect substantially all aspects of our land development and home design, construction and sales processes in varying degrees across our markets. Our homes are inspected by local authorities where required, and homes eligible for insurance or guarantees provided by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) are subject to inspection by them. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities. In addition, our new housing developments may be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets, utilities and other public improvements. 

Our homebuilding operations are also subject to an extensive array of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of health, safety and the environment. The particular environmental laws for each site vary greatly according to location, environmental condition and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties. 

Our mortgage company must comply with extensive state and federal laws and regulations, which are administered by numerous agencies, including but not limited to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Federal Housing Finance Agency, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, FHA, VA, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. These laws and regulations include many compliance requirements, including but not limited to licensing, consumer disclosures, fair lending and real estate settlement procedures. As a result, our operations are subject to regular, extensive examinations by the applicable agencies. 

Seasonality 

Although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally close more homes and generate greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. The seasonal nature of our business can also cause significant variations in our working capital requirements in both our homebuilding and financial services operations. As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.
