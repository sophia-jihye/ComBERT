&#160;

We are currently selling &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; products that are offered by our suppliers. If we are successful in our business plan we will begin to develop our own furniture and also offer clients the ability to custom design their own products. 

&#160;

Our table sets, chairs, sofas and other furniture products come with a 1 year warranty. We plan on expanding our product selection in the future. General market research done by our director shows table sets, chairs, sofas and other furniture similar to those we will offer are very popular outdoors in restaurants, resorts, private homes or just as stand-alone products. Our director conducted limited market research and talked to restaurant owners and some resorts buyers. His conclusion was that what we offer is what they are looking for, at fair price and high quality.

&#160;

Target Market 

&#160;

It is our belief based on management&#8217;s observations and information gleaned from major USA magazines (Home magazines) that contemporary (latest trend) furniture table sets, chairs, sofas and other furniture have increased in popularity over time, and they have caused significant impact upon popular culture and have spawned many fads. The unfortunate side of contemporary, or latest trend, table sets, chairs, sofas and other furniture is that they are quickly replaced by the-next-best-thing. Quick developments of technology has stock continuously changing with popularity. The simple and easy to use furniture are set to provide the customers with the product they seek with no bells and whistles. This helps to keep the cost of furniture low. This contemporary market is our target market. 

&#160;

Industry analysis 

&#160;

The furniture industry is an established structure of distributors, route operators and family furniture centers. In North America, there are several associations such as National Furniture Association www.nationalfurnitureassociation.com and International Furnishings and Design Association www.ifda.com. Internationally, there are similar associations in most developed countries. Each of these organizations has members, each being a potential customer for EMERALD DATA INC. platform. In addition to the &#8220;organized&#8221; part of the industry, there are many smaller operators that can be reached via industry magazine advertising and direct contact. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in finding more potential customers.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

Trade shows: 

In North America, there are several major trade shows in the furniture industry, such as Dining By Design, Home and Landscaping Show. Trade show marketing will be a key component of our overall marketing campaign. We intend to present at a major industry trade show within 7-12 months after the completion of our offering. The average trade show booth costs about $3,500 and $1,000 to deliver goods.

&#160;

Direct contact with distributors: 

We have identified some of distributors of Outdoor, Wicker, Patio, Garden Rattan Furniture in the U.S.A., and intend to market directly to these distributors.

&#160;

Industry advertising 

&#160;

We intend to advertise online and using ads in industry-related magazines. Some sites and industry media have already been identified. A media advertising campaign will coincide with our Trade Show marketing campaign.

&#160;

Freight 

&#160;

Product availability is also a key component of sales, especially when it comes to revenue-generating product. We have researched delivery methods, cost and estimated delivery times to all major markets. Once we begin designing our own furniture and not just buying from existing product from the manufacturers, we anticipate 25 days delivery time to the USA from China.

&#160;

Contracts 

&#160;

During August 2014, EMERALD DATA INC. executed contracts with J and K Industrial Limited, LINHAI FEELWAY LEISURE PRODUCTS CO., Magic Style International Co., Ltd., Ningbo Grand Ocean International CO., Ltd., NINGBO JIADA LEISURE PRODUCTS CO., LTD. and Patio Design. All are manufacturing companies having principal offices in China. These companies were engaged as independent contractors for the specific purpose of developing, manufacturing and supplying products for us under the terms and conditions contained in each agreement. 

&#160;

Revenue 

&#160;

- Our revenue will be 10-30 % mark up: depending on quantity of the order.

- Manufacturer gives us 90 days to pay an invoice and we give to our customers 30- 60 days depending on a quantity of the order to pay their invoices which allows us to make sales without initial investment for the furniture.

- We will not keep warehousing and shipping within the country because all the products will be going directly to our clients from the manufacturer eliminating our storage costs.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There are few barriers of entry in the Outdoor, Wicker, Patio, Garden Rattan Furniture distribution business and level of competition is extremely high. There are many domestic and international distributors of this type of furniture. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large distributors have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better prices for similar furniture than us which may also cause us to lose business.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than Janis Kalnins, our president and director. We intend to hire a sales representative if we are able to generate revenue to cover the cost.
