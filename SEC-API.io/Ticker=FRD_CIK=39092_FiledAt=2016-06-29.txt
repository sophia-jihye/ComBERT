 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Friedman Industries, Incorporated (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Texas corporation incorporated in 1965, is engaged in steel processing, pipe manufacturing and processing and steel and pipe distribution. 

&#160; 

The Company has two product groups: coil and tubular products. Significant financial information relating to the Company&#8217;s product groups for the last two years is contained in Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company&#8217;s Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, which financial statements are incorporated herein by reference in Item 8 hereof. 

&#160; 

Coil Products 

&#160; 

The Company purchases prime hot-rolled steel coils, processes the coils into flat, finished sheet and plate and sells these products on a wholesale, rapid-delivery basis in competition with steel mills, importers and steel service centers. 

&#160; 

The Company owns and operates two coil processing facilities located in Hickman, Arkansas (&#8220;Hickman&#8221;) and Decatur, Alabama (&#8220;Decatur&#8221;). Each facility operates a cut-to-length line and a steel temper mill. The cut-to-length lines are designed to level the steel and cut the material to prescribed lengths. The steel temper mills are designed to improve the flatness of the steel and its surface qualities. The Company&#8217;s processing machinery is heavy, mill-type equipment capable of processing coils weighing up to 25 tons. Coils are processed to the specifications required for a particular order. Shipments are made via unaffiliated truckers or by rail. 

&#160; 

The Hickman and Decatur facilities are functionally equivalent with respect to machinery, equipment, capacities and products produced. The Company makes shipments of coil products based on which facility offers the desired product or, if the product is available at both facilities, based on other factors, such as customer location, freight conditions and the ability of the facility to fulfill the order on a timely basis. 

&#160; 

The Company also purchases and markets non-standard hot-rolled steel coils through its XSCP Division (&#8220;XSCP&#8221;). XSCP routinely processes non-standard coils into flat, finished sheet and plate. XSCP operates from the Company&#8217;s Hickman and Decatur coil processing facilities and shares certain expenses and employees with Hickman and Decatur. In addition, Hickman and Decatur provide warehousing, processing and distribution services to XSCP. 

&#160; 

The Company primarily purchases hot-rolled steel coils from steel mills operated by Nucor Steel Company (&#8220;NSC&#8221;) located near the Hickman and Decatur processing facilities. Loss of NSC as a source of coil supply could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

The Company also processes customer-owned coils on a fee basis. Revenues generated from processing customer-owned coils are not material to the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Tubular Products 

&#160; 

Through its Texas Tubular Products Division (&#8220;TTP&#8221;) in Lone Star, Texas, the Company manufactures, purchases, processes and markets tubular products (&#8220;pipe&#8221;). 

&#160; 

TTP operates two pipe mills. Both pipe mill #1 and pipe mill #2 are American Petroleum Institute-licensed to manufacture line and oil country pipe and also manufacture pipe for structural purposes that meets other recognized industry standards. Pipe mill #1 focuses on producing pipe with outside diameters (&#8220;OD&#8221;) of 6 5/8&#8221; and 8 5/8&#8221;. Pipe mill #2 is capable of producing pipe with OD ranging from 2 3/8&#8221; to 5 9/16&#8221; with the majority of production focusing on OD of 4 1/2&#8221;, 5 1/2&#8221; and 5 9/16&#8221;. TTP also employs various pipe processing equipment, including beveling machines, pipe handling equipment and other related machinery. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company is currently constructing a pipe-finishing facility in Lone Star, Texas that it expects to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The facility will focus primarily on threading and coupling oil country tubular goods. 

&#160; 

Historically, the Company has purchased steel coils from U.S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc. (&#8220;USS&#8221;), an affiliate of United States Steel Corporation, converted these coils into line and oil country pipe, and sold this pipe to USS pursuant to orders received from USS. In recent years, orders from USS have declined due to the increased presence of low priced imported material. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, orders from USS were also negatively impacted by a significant decline in the U.S. energy industry. The Company has also purchased new mill reject pipe from USS and marketed it to other customers for structural and other miscellaneous applications. In March 2016, USS announced it was temporarily idling its Lone Star Tubular Operations facility due to weak market conditions. The Company is unable to provide an estimate of how long USS&#8217;s Lone Star facility will be idled. The Company expects orders from USS to remain low and supplies of new mill reject pipe from USS to be significantly reduced while USS&#8217;s Lone Star facility remains idled and the U.S. energy industry remains depressed. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Loss of USS as a supplier or customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business. The Company can make no assurances as to orders from USS or the amounts of pipe and coil material that will be available from USS in the future. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of total sales contributed by each group of products and services during each of the Company&#8217;s last two fiscal years: 

&#160; 

Product and Service Groups 

&#160; 2016 

&#160; &#160; 2015 

&#160; Coil Products 

&#160; &#160; 81 % &#160; &#160; 67 % Tubular Products 

&#160; &#160; 19 % &#160; &#160; 33 % &#160; 

Coil Products. The Company sells coil products and processing services to approximately 125 customers located primarily in the midwestern, southwestern and southeastern regions of the United States. The Company&#8217;s principal customers for these products and services are steel distributors and customers fabricating steel products such as storage tanks, steel buildings, farm machinery and equipment, construction equipment, transportation equipment, conveyors and other similar products. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, one and two customers of coil products, respectively, accounted for at least 25% of the Company&#8217;s total sales. Sales of coil products to Trinity Industries, Inc. accounted for approximately 35% and 21% of the Company&#8217;s total sales in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

The Company sells substantially all of its coil products through its own sales force. At March 31, 2016, the sales force was comprised of three professional sales personnel under the direction of the Senior Vice President &#8212; Sales and Marketing. Sales personnel are paid on a salary and commission basis. 

&#160; 

The Company makes regular commitments with many of its larger customers to supply minimum quantities of steel during agreed upon periods of time. 

&#160; 

Tubular Products. The Company sells its tubular products nationally to approximately 135 customers. The Company&#8217;s principal customers for these products are steel and pipe distributors, piling contractors and, historically, USS. In fiscal years 2016 and 2015, no individual tubular customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s total sales. 

&#160; 

The Company sells substantially all of its tubular products through its own sales force comprised of a sales manager and two professional sales personnel under the direction of the Senior Vice President &#8212; Sales and Marketing. Sales personnel are paid on a salary and commission basis. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company is engaged in a non-seasonal, highly-competitive business. The Company competes with steel mills, importers and steel service centers. The steel industry, in general, is characterized by a small number of extremely large companies dominating the bulk of the market and a large number of relatively small companies, such as the Company, competing for a limited share of such market. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company believes that, generally, its ability to compete is dependent upon its ability to offer products at prices competitive with or below those of other steel suppliers, as well as its ability to provide products meeting customer specifications on a rapid-delivery basis. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At March 31, 2016, the Company had 86 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees.
