 Item 1. 

Business.

United Security Bancshares, Inc. (&#8220;USBI&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation organized in 1999 as a successor by merger with United Security Bancshares, Inc., an Alabama corporation. USBI is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and it operates one banking subsidiary, First US Bank (&#8220;FUSB&#8221; or &#8220;the Bank&#8221;). 

The Bank conducts a general commercial banking business and offers banking services such as demand, savings, individual retirement account and time deposits, personal and commercial loans, safe deposit box services and remote deposit capture. The Bank operates and serves its customers through twenty banking offices located in Brent, Bucksville, Butler, Calera, Centreville, Coffeeville, Columbiana, Fulton, Gilbertown, Grove Hill, Harpersville, Jackson, Thomasville, Tuscaloosa and Woodstock, Alabama. Most recently, the Bank opened a second full-service branch office in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in October 2015. The Bank has two wholly owned subsidiaries: Acceptance Loan Company, Inc. (&#8220;ALC&#8221;) and FUSB Reinsurance, Inc. (&#8220;FUSB Reinsurance&#8221;). As used herein, unless the context suggests otherwise, references to the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to USBI, as well as the Bank, ALC, and FUSB Reinsurance, collectively. 

ALC is an Alabama corporation with approximately 22,200 consumer and real estate loans outstanding. ALC operates and serves its customers through twenty-two offices in Alabama and southeast Mississippi, including the ALC headquarters located in Mobile, Alabama. ALC&#8217;s business is generated through referrals from retail businesses, banks and customer mailings. ALC serves customers with a broad range of consumer loan needs. ALC&#8217;s lending guidelines are based on an established company policy that is reviewed regularly by its Loan Committee. The lending guidelines include a consideration of collateral (age, type and loan-to-value) and loan term, as well as the borrower&#8217;s budget (debt-to-income ratio), employment and residence history, credit score, credit history and prior experience with ALC. ALC&#8217;s average loan size is approximately $3,700, with an average term of 24 to 36 months. ALC currently has loans of approximately $81.7 million, which carry an average yield of 20.7%. Interest rates charged vary depending on a consideration of certain factors, such as credit score and collateral. Approximately 20.0% of ALC&#8217;s current loan portfolio is secured by real estate and single family residence loans, with the remaining portion of the portfolio secured by various other types of collateral, depending on the type of loan being secured. As a result of weakness in the real estate market, ALC suspended making new real estate loans in May 2012. 

FUSB Reinsurance is an Arizona corporation that underwrites credit life and credit accident and health insurance policies sold to the Bank&#8217;s and ALC&#8217;s consumer loan customers. FUSB Reinsurance is responsible for the first level of risk on these policies up to a specified maximum amount, and a primary third-party insurer retains the remaining risk. A third-party insurer and/or a third-party administrator are responsible for performing most of the administrative functions of FUSB Reinsurance on a contract basis.

Employees

USBI has no employees, other than the executive officers discussed in the information incorporated by reference in Part III, Item 10 of this report. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had 173 full-time equivalent employees, and ALC had 105 full-time equivalent employees. FUSB Reinsurance has no employees.

Competition

We face strong competition in making loans, acquiring deposits and attracting customers for investment services. Competition among financial institutions is based on interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the quality and scope of the services rendered, the convenience of banking facilities and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. We compete with numerous other financial services providers (in excess of thirty in our service area), including commercial banks, online banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment banking companies, brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries operating in Alabama and elsewhere. Many of these competitors, some of which are affiliated with large bank holding companies, have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do. In addition, many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks. 

The financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

General

We are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. These laws restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with various consumer protection provisions applicable to lending, deposit, brokerage and fiduciary activities. They also impose capital adequacy requirements and condition USBI&#8217;s ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from the Bank. USBI is subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), and the Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive examination and supervision by the Alabama State Banking Department (the &#8220;ASBD&#8221;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;). These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on our operations. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct and profitability of our activities. 

To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of such provisions. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised at both the state and federal level. The likelihood and timing of any changes in these laws and regulations, as well as the impact that such changes may have on us, are difficult to ascertain. A change in applicable laws and regulations, or in the manner in which such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material effect on our business, operations and earnings.

Regulation of USBI

USBI is registered as a bank holding company and is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. The BHCA requires a bank holding company to secure the approval of the Federal Reserve before it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank or thrift, or merges or consolidates with another bank or thrift holding company. Further, under the BHCA, the activities of a bank holding company and any nonbank subsidiary are limited to: (i) those activities that the Federal Reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, and (ii) investments in companies not engaged in activities closely related to banking, subject to quantitative limitations on the value of such investments. Prior approval of the Federal Reserve may be required before engaging in certain activities. In making such determinations, the Federal Reserve is required to weigh the expected benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition and gains in efficiency, against the possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices. 

The BHCA was substantially amended by the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the &#8220;Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act&#8221; or the &#8220;GLBA&#8221;), which, among other things, permits a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; to engage in a broader range of non-banking activities, and to engage on less restrictive terms in certain activities, than were previously permitted. These expanded activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and sales, and merchant banking activities. To become a financial holding company, USBI must certify that the Bank is both &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; (as defined by federal law), and has at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) rating. At this time, USBI has not elected to become a financial holding company. 

There are a number of restrictions imposed on us by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential losses to the depositors of the Bank and the Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the FDIC (as discussed in more detail below) if the Bank should become insolvent. For example, the Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances in which they might not do so absent such a requirement. The Federal Reserve also has the authority under the BHCA to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the Federal Reserve&#8217;s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 

Any capital loan by USBI to the Bank is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of the Bank. In addition, in the event of USBI&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by USBI to a federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as a subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, then insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority of payment over unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the institution&#8217;s holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit that they have made to such insured depository institution. 

&#160;

Regulation of the Bank 

The operations and investments of the Bank are limited by federal and state statutes and regulations. The Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the ASBD and the FDIC and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types, amount and terms and conditions of loans that it may originate, and limits on the types of other activities in which the Bank may engage and the investments it may make. 

The Bank is subject to federal laws that limit the amount of transactions between the Bank and its nonbank affiliates, including USBI. Under these provisions, transactions by the Bank with nonbank affiliates (such as loans or investments) are generally limited to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus for all covered transactions with any one affiliate and 20% of capital and surplus for all covered transactions with all affiliates. Any extensions of credit to affiliates, with limited exceptions, must be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. The Bank is also prohibited from purchasing any &#8220;low quality&#8221; assets from an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) imposed additional requirements on transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the length of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. 

Securities and Exchange Commission

USBI is under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) for matters relating to the offer and sale of its securities and is subject to the SEC&#8217;s rules and regulations related to periodic reporting, reporting to shareholders, proxy solicitations and insider trading regulations.

Monetary Policy

Our earnings are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a substantial effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Bank. The Federal Reserve has a significant impact on the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of, among other things, the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member banks&#8217; deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature and impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.

Deposit Insurance

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the FDIC. Under the FDIC&#8217;s current risk-based assessment system, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act and the FDIC&#8217;s final rule on assessments, dividend assessment base and large bank pricing (the &#8220;Assessment Rule&#8221;), insured institutions are assigned to one of four categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels, and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends on the category to which it is assigned and the applicability of certain potential adjustments established by FDIC regulations, with lower-risk institutions paying lower assessment rates. 

&#160;

The assessment base against which the assessment rate is applied to determine the total assessment due for a given period is the depository institution&#8217;s average total consolidated assets during the assessment period, less average tangible equity during that assessment period. Tangible equity is defined in the Assessment Rule as Tier 1 Capital (described below) and is calculated monthly, unless the institution has less than $1 billion in assets, in which case the institution calculates Tier 1 Capital on an end-of-quarter basis. Parents or holding companies of other insured depository institutions are required to report separately from their subsidiary depository institutions. 

&#160;

The FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in June 2015 that it revised in January 2016 to set forth several significant proposed changes to the methodology for calculating deposit insurance assessments for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Under the proposed rule, the current system would be eliminated, and the rate would instead be determined based on a number of factors, including the bank&#8217;s CAMELS ratings, leverage ratio, net income, non-performing loan ratios, OREO ratios, core deposit ratios, one-year organic asset growth and a loan mix index. The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system developed to classify a bank&#8217;s overall condition by taking into account capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market and interest rate risk. The loan mix index component of the assessment model requires banks to calculate each of their loan categories as a percentage of assets and then multiply each category by a standardized historical charge-off rate percentage provided by the FDIC, with a higher index leading to a higher assessment rate. The proposal would implement maximum assessment rates for institutions with a composite CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 and minimum rates for institutions with a rating of 3, 4 or 5. As revised, the rules would go into effect the quarter after the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches 1.15 percent (or the first quarter after a final rule is adopted that the rule can take effect, whichever is later).

&#160;

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also eliminated the ceiling and increased the floor on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund. It established a minimum designated reserve ratio of 1.35% of the estimated insured deposits and required the FDIC to adopt a restoration plan should the reserve ratio fall below 1.35%. However, under the current framework, the assessment rate schedules used to determine assessments due from insured depository institutions become progressively lower when the reserve ratio in the Deposit Insurance Fund exceeds 1.15%, 2%, and 2.5%.

&#160;

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, insured depository institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. This payment is established quarterly and equaled 0.60 basis points on assessable deposits for the first two calendar quarters of 2015, 0.58 basis points for the third quarter of 2015, 0.60 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2015, and 0.58 basis points for the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also raised the limit for federal deposit insurance to $250,000 for each covered account and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation coverage from $100,000 to $250,000. 

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance assessments would likely have an adverse effect on our operating expense, results of operations, and cash flows. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. Furthermore, deposit insurance may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Dividend Restrictions

Under applicable Delaware law, dividends may be paid only out of &#8220;surplus,&#8221; defined as an amount equal to the present fair value of the total assets of the corporation, minus the present fair value of the total liabilities of the corporation, minus the capital of the corporation as determined in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. In the event that there is no surplus, dividends may be paid out of the net profits of the corporation for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the immediately preceding fiscal year. Dividends may not be paid, however, out of net profits of the corporation if the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference on the distribution of assets is impaired. Further, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if future retained earnings would be consistent with the company&#8217;s capital, asset quality and financial condition. 

Since it has no significant independent sources of income, USBI&#8217;s ability to pay dividends depends on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank. Under Alabama law, a state-chartered bank must annually transfer to surplus at least 10% of its &#8220;net earnings&#8221; (defined as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets, less all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, and all federal, state and local taxes) until the bank&#8217;s surplus is at least 20% of its capital. Until the bank&#8217;s surplus reaches this level, a bank may not declare a dividend in excess of 90% of its net earnings. Once a bank&#8217;s surplus equals or exceeds 20% of its capital, if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in a calendar year will exceed the sum of its net earnings for that year and its retained net earnings for the preceding two years (less any required transfers to surplus), then the bank must obtain prior written approval from the Superintendent of the ASBD. The bank may not pay any dividends or make any withdrawals or transfers from surplus without the prior written approval of the Superintendent. The FDIC prohibits the payment of cash dividends if (i) as a result of such payment, the bank would be undercapitalized or (ii) the bank is in default with respect to any assessment due to the FDIC, including a deposit insurance assessment. These restrictions could materially influence the Bank&#8217;s, and therefore USBI&#8217;s, ability to pay dividends.

Capital Adequacy Guidelines

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, known as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; Basel III requires banks to maintain a higher level of capital than previously required, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed generally applicable capital requirements with respect to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries and mandated that the federal banking regulatory agencies adopt rules and regulations to implement the Basel III requirements, which they did through the adoption of a final rule in July 2013 (the &#8220;Basel III Final Rule&#8221;). 

&#160;

The Basel III Final Rule provides risk-based capital guidelines designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposures, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Under these guidelines, assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate risk-weights. The net amount of assets remaining after applying the risk-weights to the gross asset values comprises the institution&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets. Most loans are assigned to the 100% risk category, except for performing first mortgage loans fully secured 

&#160;

by residential property, which carry a 50% risk weighting. Most investment securities (including, primarily, general obligation claims of states or other po litical subdivisions of the United States) are assigned to the 20% category. Exceptions include municipal or state revenue bonds, which have a 50% risk weighting, and direct obligations of the United States Treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, which have a 0% risk weighting. In converting off-balance sheet items, direct credit substitutes, including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations, are given a 100% risk we ighting. Transaction-related contingencies such as bid bonds, standby letters of credit backing non-financial obligations, and undrawn commitments (including commercial credit lines with an initial maturity of more than one year) have a 50% risk weighting. Short-term commercial letters of credit have a 20% risk weighting, and certain short-term unconditionally cancelable commitments have a 0% risk weighting. 

&#160;

The institution&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets are used to calculate its regulatory capital ratios. Under the Basel III Final Rule, as of January 1, 2015, the minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is 8%. The required ratio of &#8220;Tier 1 Capital&#8221; (consisting generally of shareholders&#8217; equity and qualifying preferred stock, less certain goodwill items and other intangible assets) to risk-weighted assets is 6%. While there was previously no required ratio of &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1 Capital&#8221; (which generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, certain qualifying capital instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries, and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, subject to certain adjustments) to risk-weighted assets, a required minimum ratio of 4.5% became effective on January 1, 2015 as well. The remainder of total capital, or &#8220;Tier 2 Capital,&#8221; may consist of (i) the allowance for loan losses of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, (ii) preferred stock not qualifying as Tier 1 Capital, (iii) hybrid capital instruments, (iv) perpetual debt, (v) mandatory convertible securities, and (vi) certain subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock up to 50% of Tier 1 Capital. Total Capital is the sum of Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital (which is included only to the extent of Tier 1 Capital), less reciprocal holdings of other banking organizations&#8217; capital instruments, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and any other deductions as determined by the appropriate regulator. 

&#160;

In addition, the federal banking agencies have established minimum leverage ratio requirements for banking organizations that they supervise, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average consolidated assets. Prior to the effective date of the Basel III Final Rule, banks and bank holding companies meeting certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing significant growth or expansion, were permitted to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 3%. Other banks and bank holding companies generally were required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio between 4% and 5%. Under the Basel III Final Rule, as of January 1, 2015, the required minimum leverage ratio for all banks is 4%. 

&#160;

The Basel III Final Rule additionally provides for countercyclical capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. Under the Basel III Final Rule, banks must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional Common Equity Tier 1 Capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above each of the required minimum capital levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying certain discretionary bonuses. This new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% in January 2019. 

As an additional means of identifying problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the federal banking regulatory agencies have established certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure and executive compensation. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards. 

Prompt Corrective Action

In addition to the required minimum capital levels described above, federal law establishes a system of &#8220;prompt corrective actions&#8221; that federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions that they have discretion to take, based on the capital category into which a federally regulated depository institution falls. Regulations set forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution that is not adequately capitalized. Under the prompt corrective action rules effective as of January 1, 2015, an institution is deemed &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if its leverage ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio, and Total Capital ratio meet or exceed 5%, 6.5%, 8% and 10%, respectively. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; or better if its leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios meet or exceed the minimum federal regulatory capital requirements, and &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it fails to meet these minimum capital requirements. An institution is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if its leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios fall below 3%, 3%, 4% and 6%, respectively, and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 2%. 

&#160;

The prompt corrective action rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party. In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain 

&#160;

automatic restrictions, including a prohibition on paying dividends and a limitation on asset growth or expansion in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonus es or raises to senior executive officers, and a prohibition on the payment of certain &#8220;management fees&#8221; to any &#8220;controlling person.&#8221; Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring; limitations on the institution&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices, or engage in new lines of business; obligations to raise additional capital; restrictions on transactions with a ffiliates; and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits. In certain cases, banking regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser. If an institution is deemed to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; and continues in that category for 90 days, the statute requires, with certain narrowly limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership. &#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, both USBI and the Bank were classified as &#8220;well-capitalized.&#8221; This classification is primarily for the purpose of applying the federal prompt corrective action provisions and is not intended to be, and should not be, interpreted as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects.

Community Reinvestment Act

The CRA requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to assess all financial institutions that they regulate to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the communities that they serve, including their assessment area(s) (as established for these purposes in accordance with applicable regulations based principally on the location of the institution&#8217;s branch offices). Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve&#8221; or &#8220;unsatisfactory.&#8221; An institution&#8217;s record in meeting the requirements of the CRA is made publicly available and is taken into consideration in connection with any applications that it files with federal regulators to engage in certain activities, including approval of branches or other deposit facilities, mergers and acquisitions, office relocations or expansions into non-banking activities. The Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating in its most recent CRA evaluation.

Anti-Money Laundering Laws

Under various federal laws, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act (also known as the &#8220;Bank Secrecy Act&#8221;), as amended by the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. These laws also mandate that financial institutions establish anti-money laundering programs meeting certain standards and require the federal banking regulators to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution&#8217;s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley&#8221;) comprehensively revised the laws affecting corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and corporate reporting for entities with equity or debt securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and its implementing regulations established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for audit committees, imposed restrictions on the relationships between public companies and their outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services that auditors may provide), imposed additional responsibilities for public companies&#8217; external financial statements on the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and expanded the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders. The requirements are intended to allow stockholders to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and directors. We and our Board of Directors have, as appropriate, adopted or modified our policies and practices in order to comply with these regulatory requirements and to enhance our corporate governance practices. 

As required by Sarbanes-Oxley, we have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to our Board, executives and employees. This Code of Business Conduct can be found on our website at http://www.firstusbank.com under the tabs &#8220;About Us &#8211; Investor Relations &#8211; USBI Policies.&#8221; 

Privacy of Customer Information

The GLBA and the implementing regulations issued by federal banking regulatory agencies require financial institutions (including banks, insurance agencies, and broker/dealers) to adopt policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about their customers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, financial institutions are required to explain to customers their policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information, and, unless otherwise required or permitted by law, financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in their policies 

&#160;

and procedures. Specifically, the GLBA established certain information security guidelines that require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an a ppropriate committee thereof, to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the sec urity or integrity of such information, and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which is an independent bureau with broad authority to regulate the consumer finance industry, including regulated financial institutions, non-banks and others involved in extending credit to consumers. The CFPB has authority through rulemaking, orders, policy statements, guidance and enforcement actions to administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws, to oversee several entities and market segments not previously under the supervision of a federal regulator, and to impose its own regulations and pursue enforcement actions when it determines that a practice is unfair, deceptive or abusive. The federal consumer financial laws and all of the functions and responsibilities associated with them, many of which were previously enforced by other federal regulatory agencies, were transferred to the CFPB on July 21, 2011. While the CFPB has the power to interpret, administer and enforce federal consumer financial laws, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the federal banking regulatory agencies continue to have examination and enforcement powers over the financial institutions that they supervise relating to the matters within the jurisdiction of the CFPB if such institutions have less than $10 billion in assets. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.

Mortgage Loan Origination 

The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing final rule adopted by the CFPB (the &#8220;ATR/QM Rule&#8221;), a financial institution may not make a residential mortgage loan to a consumer unless it first makes a &#8220;reasonable and good faith determination&#8221; that the consumer has a &#8220;reasonable ability&#8221; to repay the loan. In addition, the ATR/QM Rule limits prepayment penalties and permits borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage,&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. For this purpose, the ATR/QM Rule defines a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; to include a loan with a borrower debt-to-income ratio of less than or equal to 43% or, alternatively, a loan eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while they operate under federal conservatorship or receivership, and loans eligible for insurance or guarantee by the Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Administration or United States Department of Agriculture. Additionally, a qualified mortgage may not: (i) contain excess upfront points and fees; (ii) have a term greater than 30 years; or (iii) include interest-only or negative amortization payments. The ATR/QM Rule specifies the types of income and assets that may be considered in the ability-to-repay determination, the permissible sources for verification, and the required methods of calculating the loan&#8217;s monthly payments. The ATR/QM Rule became effective January 10, 2014. 

In addition, Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to require sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of the assets underlying the securities and generally prohibits sponsors from transferring or hedging that credit risk. In October 2014, the federal banking regulatory agencies adopted a final rule to implement this requirement (the &#8220;Risk Retention Rule&#8221;). Among other things, the Risk Retention Rule (i) requires a securitizer to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of any asset that the securitizer, through the issuance of an ABS, transfers, sells, or conveys to a third party and (ii) prohibits a securitizer from directly or indirectly hedging or otherwise transferring the credit risk that the securitizer is required to retain. In certain situations, the final rule allows securitizers to allocate a portion of the risk retention requirement to the originator(s) of the securitized assets, if an originator contributes at least 20% of the assets in the securitization. The Risk Retention Rule also provides an exemption to the risk retention requirements for an ABS collateralized exclusively by qualified residential mortgages (&#8220;QRMs&#8221;), and ties the definition of a QRM to the definition of a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; established by the CFPB for purposes of evaluating a consumer&#8217;s ability to repay a mortgage loan. The federal banking agencies have agreed to review the definition of QRMs in 2019, following the CFPB&#8217;s own review of its &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; regulation. The Risk Retention Rule took effect in December 2015.

Mortgage Loan Servicing

On January 17, 2013, the CFPB issued a series of final rules as part of an ongoing effort to address mortgage servicing reforms and create uniform standards for the mortgage servicing industry. The rules contain additional requirements for communications with borrowers, address the maintenance of customer account records, govern procedures for responding to written borrower requests and complaints of errors, and provide guidance regarding servicing delinquent loans, foreclosure proceedings, and loss mitigation efforts, among other measures. These rules became effective on January 10, 2014 and have in general led to increased costs to service loans across the mortgage industry.

Other Provisions of the Do dd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law on July 21, 2010, implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape. In addition to the reforms previously mentioned, the Dodd-Frank Act also: 

&#160;

&#183; 

requires bank holding companies and banks to be both well-capitalized and well-managed in order to acquire banks located outside of their home state and requires any bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company to be both well-managed and well-capitalized; 

&#160;

&#183; 

eliminates all remaining restrictions on interstate banking by authorizing national and state banks to establish de novo branches in any state that would permit a bank chartered in that state to open a branch at that location; 

&#160;

&#183; 

repeals Regulation Q, the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts; 

&#160;

&#183; 

strengthens the restrictions on loans to insiders and limits certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution by, among other things, requiring that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution&#8217;s board of directors; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

strengthens the previous limits on a depository institution&#8217;s credit exposure to one borrower (whether a person or group of related persons) in an amount exceeding certain thresholds by expanding the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions. 

While designed primarily to reform the financial regulatory system, the Dodd-Frank Act also contains a number of corporate governance provisions that will affect public companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt rules that may affect our executive compensation policies and disclosure. It also exempts &#8220;smaller reporting companies,&#8221; like USBI, from the requirement under Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley that the independent auditor attest to and report on management&#8217;s assessment of internal control over financial reporting.

&#160;

Although a significant number of the rules and regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, many of the requirements called for have yet to be implemented and will likely be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various agencies, the full extent of the impact that such requirements will have on our operations is unclear.

Federal Home Loan Bank Membership

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (&#8220;FHLBA&#8221;). Each member of the FHLBA is required to maintain a minimum investment in the Class B stock of the FHLBA. The Board of Directors of the FHLBA can increase the minimum investment requirements if it concludes that additional capital is required to allow it to meet its own regulatory capital requirements. Any increase in the minimum investment requirements outside of specified ranges requires the approval of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Because the extent of any obligation to increase the level of investment in the FHLBA depends entirely on the occurrence of a future event, we are unable to determine the extent of future required potential payments to the FHLBA at this time. Additionally, in the event that a member financial institution fails, the right of the FHLBA to seek repayment of funds loaned to that institution will take priority over the rights of all other creditors.

Other Laws and Regulations

Our operations are subject to several additional laws, some of which are specific to banking and others of which are applicable to commercial operations generally. For example, with respect to our lending practices, we are subject to the following laws, among several others:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities that it serves; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Equal Credit Oppor tunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other specified factors in extending credit; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections, and certain credit and other disclosures; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring certain disclosures concerning loan closing costs and escrows, and governing transfers of loan servicing and the amounts of escrows in connection with loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Rules and regulations established by the National Flood Insurance Program; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 

&#160;

Our deposit operations are subject to federal laws applicable to depository accounts, including:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Truth-In-Savings Act, requiring certain disclosures for consumer deposit accounts; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E of the Federal Reserve, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 

We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations that are not limited to banking organizations. For example, in lending to commercial and consumer borrowers, and in owning and operating our own property, we are subject to regulations and potential liabilities under state and federal environmental laws. In addition, we must comply with privacy and data security laws and regulations at both the federal and state level. 

We are heavily regulated by regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. Like most of our competitors, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased regulation and regulatory and political scrutiny, which creates significant uncertainty for us, as well as for the financial services industry in general.

Enforcement Powers 

The Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) expanded and increased the penalties available for use by the federal regulatory agencies against depository institutions and certain &#8220;institution-affiliated parties.&#8221; Institution-affiliated parties primarily include management, employees, and agents of a financial institution, as well as independent contractors and consultants, such as attorneys, accountants, and others who participate in the conduct of the financial institution&#8217;s affairs. An institution can be subject to an enforcement action or civil penalties due to the failure to timely file required reports, the filing of false or misleading information, the submission of inaccurate reports, or engaging in other unsafe or unsound banking practices. 

FIRREA provides regulators with significant flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution-affiliated parties and to terminate an institution&#8217;s deposit insurance. It also expanded the power of banking regulatory agencies to issue regulatory orders. Such orders may, among other things, require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice, including restitution, reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantees against loss. A financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth, dispose of certain assets, rescind agreements or contracts, or take other actions as determined by the ordering agency to be appropriate. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies, and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency.

&#160;

Future Legislation and Regulation 

Regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry in recent years, leading in many cases to greater uncertainty and compliance costs for regulated entities. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could require us to make material expenditures, particularly in the form of personnel training costs and additional compliance expenses. We also may be required to change certain of our business practices in order to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to pursue business opportunities that we might otherwise consider pursuing, cause business disruptions, or have other impacts that are as of yet unknown. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in negative publicity, fines, or additional expenses. 

Furthermore, proposals that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the United States Congress, in state legislatures, and by applicable regulatory authorities. These proposals may change banking statutes and regulations and the operating environment for financial services firms in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that these proposals would have on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
