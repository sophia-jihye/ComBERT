The Company completes the construction and building of infrastructure including staff quarters, offices, processing facilities, storage, and all related production facilities. The Company&#8217;s management teams are responsible for developing all business activities into effective and efficient operations.

&#160;

In just a few years, Sino Agro Food has matured into a company dedicated to the agriculture and aquaculture industry in China. The Company currently maintains operation of its HU Plantation (see description in section 4.10 below) as well as its services in engineering consulting, specializing in the development of two major products, namely meat derived from the rearing of beef cattle and seafood derived from the growth of fish, prawns, eel and other marine species.

&#160;

Background 

After successfully developing many aquaculture fishery farms, cattle farms and related business operations (along with sales and marketing of produce and products) in Australia and Malaysia since 1998, SIAF&#8217;s management team introduced our business activities in China in 2006. We are an engineering and consulting company that specializes in building and operating agriculture and aquaculture farms.

&#160;

To accomplish this, we use our expertise and know how in specific agriculture and aquaculture technologies. Our &#8220;A Power Re-circulating Aquaculture System,&#8221; sometimes referred to herein as APRAS, is a patented and proven technology for indoor fish farming. We have developed modern techniques and technologies to grow, feed and house both fish and cattle. These are engineered into the designs of, and the management systems for, indoor and outdoor fishery and cattle farms. Our experience managing crops, and employing technologies, including hydroponic, to work within climate and growing conditions optimizes production of organic, green and natural agricultural produce.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In all of our developments we have acted as the master engineer, pioneering the construction and building of farms, from raw land into fully operational facilities. We complete the construction and building of infrastructure including staff quarters, offices, processing facilities, storage, and all related production facilities. Our management teams are responsible for developing all business activities into effective and efficient operations.

&#160;

In just a few years, SIAF has matured into a company dedicated to the agriculture and aquaculture industry in China. We currently maintain operation of our HU Plantation as well as our services in engineering consulting, specializing in the development of two major products, namely meat derived from the rearing of beef cattle and seafood derived from the growth of fish, prawns, eel and other marine species.

&#160;

Revenues are generated from activities that we divide into five stand-alone business divisions or units: (1) Fishery, (2) Cattle &#38; Beef, (3) Organic Fertilizer, (4) HU Plantation, and (5) Marketing and Trading. This fifth and newest division, &#8220;Marketing and Trading&#8221; represents our strongest push to vertically integrate the Company&#8217;s operations, furthering the Company&#8217;s overall &#8220;farm to plate&#8221; concept.

Cross-Listing on the Merkur Market 

On January 13, 2016, securities representing beneficial interests in the shares of common stock on the Company, referred to as VPS Shares, began to be traded on the Oslo B&#248;rs&#8217; Merkur Market under the symbol &#8220;SIAF-ME.&#8221; The Company&#8217;s common shares continued to trade on the OTCQB under the symbol &#8220;SIAF.&#8221;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Merkur Market is a multilateral trading facility operated by Oslo B&#248;rs ASA. The Merkur Market is subject to the rules in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and the Securities Trading Regulations that apply to such marketplaces. These rules apply to companies admitted to trading on the Merkur Market, as do the marketplace&#8217;s own rules, which are less comprehensive than the rules and regulations that apply to companies listed on Oslo B&#248;rs and Oslo Axess. The Merkur Market is not a regulated market, and is therefore not subject to the Norwegian Stock Exchange Act or to the Stock Exchange Regulations. Investors should take this into account when making investment decisions.

&#160;

Up listing to the OTC QX Premier 

On January 19, 2016, the Company&#8217;s shares of common stock began to be traded on the OTCQX &#174; Best Market in the U.S. under its existing ticker symbol &#8220;SIAF.&#8221; The Company upgraded to OTCQX Premier from the OTCQB &#174; Venture Market.

&#160;

The OTCQX &#174; Market is the top tier of the U.S. over-the-counter markets operated by OTC Markets Company. It is reserved for established investor-focused companies meeting high financial and governance standards, and sponsored by professional third party advisors. SIAF has qualified to trade on OTCQX U.S. Premier, for which eligibility standards are higher still. For comparison, as of December 31, 2015, there were 942 companies traded on the OTCQB, 425 companies traded on the OTCQX and 98 companies traded on OTCQX U.S. Premier, of which only 17 are non-bank companies.

&#160;

With OTCQX admission, OTC Market Company&#8217;s Blue Sky Monitoring Service provides the Company with a customized daily audit of its compliance status in all 50 states.

&#160;

Emerging Growth Company 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (b) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 herein as the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221; and references herein to &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

&#160;

As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

&#160;

&#183; only two years of audited consolidated financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations&#8221; disclosure; &#160;

&#183; reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; &#160;

&#183; no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory notes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and &#160;

&#183; exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. &#160;

We have taken advantage of some of these reduced burdens, and thus the information we provide stockholders may be different from what you might receive from other public companies in which you hold shares.

&#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.

&#160;

Reverse Split 

On November 10, 2014, the board of directors of Sino Agro Food, Inc. approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effectuate a reverse stock split (the &#8220; Reverse Split &#8221;) of our common stock, par value $.001 per share, affecting both the authorized and issued and outstanding number of such shares by a ratio of 1 for 9.9.

As a result of the Reverse Split, each 9.9 shares of common stock authorized as well as each such share issued and outstanding prior to the Reverse Split has been converted into 1 share of common stock, and all options, warrants, and any other similar instruments convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of common stock have been proportionally adjusted. All references to common stock have been retroactively restated.

Business model

&#160;

The Company works with Chinese investors to form operating companies, in which Sino Agro Food retains the option to acquire equity interest. After a certain period of time and successful operating results, the Company and the Chinese investor may form a Sino Foreign Joint Venture Company (&#8220; SFJVC &#8221;). Prior to the formal naming, registration, and incorporation of an anticipated SFJVC, the Company prepays a deposit toward the consideration of its future SFJVC stake as a percentage of the assets of the fully developed farm. Upon conversion, the prepayments become equity capital.

&#160;

The Company oversees financing and provides interoperating strategies, encouraging vertically integrated growth. China has problems with quality assurance in primary production, distribution and poor origin traceability, as well as low food quality. This has created a market where consumers pay significant price premiums for organic food with brands guaranteeing quality and consistency.

&#160;

A vertically integrated operation in a fragmented and poorly regulated environment such as in China is the strategy that will yield the most success for the Company. Our presence in retailing and wholesale markets generates market power and provides potential for both margin maintenance and expansion.

&#160;

Integration into fertilizer and feed production for rearing of beef cattle together with breeding of prawn brood stock decreases primary production operational risks as well as the price volatility in production input goods.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sino Agro Food uses expertise and know-how in specific agriculture and aquaculture technologies. The Company&#8217;s &#8220;A Power Re-circulating Aquaculture System&#8221; (the &#8220; APRAS &#8221;) is a proven recirculating aquaculture system (&#8220; RAS &#8221;) technology for indoor fish farming. Sino Agro Food has developed modern techniques and technologies to grow, feed and house both fish and cattle. These are engineered into the designs of, and the management systems for, indoor and outdoor fishery and cattle farms. Today Sino Agro Food is the world&#8217;s largest operator of RAS aquaculture for prawns. In all developments Sino Agro Food acts as the master engineer, pioneering the construction and building of farms, from raw land into fully operational facilities. Sino Agro Food builds the infrastructure including staff quarters, offices, processing facilities, storage, and all related production facilities; then, manages developing of all business activities into effective and efficient operations. Sino Agro Food&#8217;s largest customer represents a Company of thirty separate live seafood wholesalers at the Guangzhou wholesale markets.

&#160;

The Company holds licenses for fertilizer formulas and for indoor fish farm techniques, including a &#8220;master license&#8221; in China for &#8220;A Power Technology&#8221; (&#8220; APT &#8221;), a modular land based fish growing system and technology utilizing RAS.

&#160;

Sino Agro Food partners with Chinese investors in food projects as a turnkey project manager 

The Company engages in projects as a technological and engineering expert, partnering with local and regional investors in food related projects. Sino Agro Food generally has exclusive marketing, sales and distribution rights for each project company. For example, CA purchases all marketable fish and prawns from the farms and distributes them to wholesale markets. CA also supplies the farms with fingerling, baby or adult fish or prawns and stock feed. MEIJI operates similarly with the cattle that are grown by Cattle Farm 1.

&#160;

&#160;

Generally, Sino Agro Food exercises an option to acquire a majority equity stake in the project company once development of the operating company has matured and successful operating results are demonstrated. Prior to acquisition, Sino Agro Food prepays a deposit toward the acquisition consideration of the project company. Upon acquisition and conversion into a SFJVC, the pre-payments together with a cash consideration become equity capital, with Sino Agro Food becoming a majority shareholder.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Acquired project companies are operated and managed by the management team and the Chinese investor, and overseen by Sino Agro Food.

&#160;

&#160; 

Land ownership in China 

In China, nearly all land is owned by the Central Government or local village collectives, which grant &#8220;usufructuary&#8221; rights (i.e., the right to use and enjoy the derived benefits for a period of time) in the form of land use rights. This is similar to &#8220;leasehold&#8221; land rights in the United States. Corporate entities and individuals may own the property (buildings) erected on Government land. Land use rights may be transferred, but they are based on agricultural contracts, and cannot be changed arbitrarily to non-agricultural purposes.

&#160;

Business overview

&#160;

Introduction 

Sino Agro Food is an agriculture technology and natural food holding company with principal operations in China participating in the ongoing transformation of China&#8217;s fragmented agrarian sector into a modern food production industry using sustainable and profitable methods. Sino Agro Food focuses on seafood and beef production with integrated wholesale distribution. The Company acquires and maintains equity stakes in a cohesive portfolio of companies that Sino Agro Food forms according to its core mission to produce, distribute, market and sell natural, sustainable protein food and produce, primarily seafood and cattle, to the rapidly growing middle class in China.

&#160;

Sino Agro Food employs a strategy of vertical integration from primary production through processing, distribution and marketing of high quality, organic food products in the food value chain. China&#8217;s fast growing middle class is creating rapidly rising demand for gourmet and high-quality protein food. The Company&#8217;s core products are live prawns, live eels, whole beef cattle and packaged beef meat.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s operations and strategy are executed through a number of subsidiaries located in China, and the Company contributes financial oversight and strategic direction to otherwise independent management teams which employ the Company&#8217;s intellectual property and proprietary methods within aquaculture, beef cattle rearing and production of organic fertilizer.

&#160;

Sino Agro Food has enjoyed strong growth since the Company initiated its business activities in China in 2006. During the fiscal year of 2015, the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues amounted to USD 429 million. The four principal factors that have enabled the growth are:

&#160;

&#183; Joint venture investment models with existing local Chinese investors in agriculture and aquaculture; &#183; Technological competitive advantages in recirculating aquaculture, beef rearing and livestock slaughter; &#183; Strong growth in Chinese consumers&#8217; demand for quality protein food; and &#183; The Chinese Government&#8217;s policy to consolidate the agrarian sector and increase the efficiency of China&#8217;s food production industry. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sino Agro Food provides consulting and services to a number of private Chinese third party companies to construct and operate primary production facilities for fish, prawn and beef cattle, as well as wholesale marketing and distribution centers. As part of its consulting and service agreements, Sino Agro Food has the option to acquire these operations in order to expand Sino Agro Food&#8217;s proprietary production and wholesaling capacity.

&#160;

Revenues are generated from activities that are divided into five stand-alone business divisions:

&#160;

(i) Aquaculture (CA: inclusive Technology engineering consulting &#38; services (Project Development division) and sales of goods) (ii) Integrated Cattle Farm (SJAP &#38; QZH) and Organic Fertilizer (HSA) (iii) Cattle Farm (MEIJI: sales of goods) (iv) Plantation, and (v) Seafood &#38; Meat Trading (SIAF GZ: inclusive Technology engineering consulting &#38; services (Project Development division) and sales of goods and corporate affairs) &#160;

Aquaculture division 

Operated by CA, the Aquaculture division is the business unit of Sino Agro Food active in sale of seafood. Revenue for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was USD 85.4 million, or 25.6 percent of the Company&#8217;s total sales of goods&#8217; revenue of USD 336.8 million in the same period. Gross profit for the Aquaculture division for the fiscal year ended December 31 st 2015 was USD18.3 million, or 24.0 percent of the Company&#8217;s total gross profit on sales of goods of USD 75.9 million in the same period. The table below lists aquaculture project companies with status and schedule for each.

&#160;

CA has entered into several CSC&#8217;s. Their information and status are shown in the table below:

&#160;

Integrated Cattle Farm division (SJAP) 

Operated by SJAP, the Integrated Cattle Farm division is the business unit of Sino Agro Food active in beef cattle rearing and value added processing of domestic and imported beef meat. Revenue for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was USD 144.6 million or 42.9 percent of the Company&#8217;s total sales of goods revenue of USD 336.8 million in the same period. Gross profit for SJAP in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was USD 33.3 million, or 43.9 percent of the Company&#8217;s total gross profit in sales of goods of USD 75.9 million in the same period.

&#160;

1. Beef cattle rearing Within the beef cattle farm division, the Company applies a co-operative farming model creating an intermediary supply pipeline to ramp up production at lower marginal cost to its operations.

&#160;

The cattle grown by the Company are primarily Simmental, Charolais, and Angus. In general, local farmers buy 12 to 15 month old cattle from the Company&#8217;s cattle agents, and the Company commits to repurchasing the cattle between 21 months to 24 months old.

&#160;

SJAP now has twelve cattle houses, with its smaller buildings housing a minimum of 200 head and larger cattle houses accommodating up to 350 head.

&#160;

Within the Chinese agriculture market, small farmers lack commercial scale and expertise and therefore benefit from a strategic alliance. The Company works with the local government, soliciting their help to introduce and initiate a farmers&#8217; co-operative, such as in the Huangyuan County, Xining City. This concept of strategic alliance with smallholder farmers under a co-operative farming model was originated and has been based on the following key characteristics and value enablers:

&#160;

&#183; The Company assesses the ability of the regional farmers to grow crops and pastures as its nominated contractors, using the Company&#8217;s land that is leased to the Company free of rent by the local government or using the farmer&#8217;s own land. The regional farmers use the Company&#8217;s plant and equipment for their planting and harvesting. The Company provides the farmers with supervision and associated services, seeds and organic fertilizer on credit terms, and also purchases crops and pastures from them. &#160;

&#183; The Company also uses this regional farmers&#8217; concept when growing cattle. The farmers are the Company&#8217;s contractors using the Company&#8217;s bulk livestock feed and concentrated livestock feed on credit terms. The Company buys the mature cattle, which the regional farmers raised on the Company&#8217;s livestock feed. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Ultimately, the Company is aiming to obtain cattle that will be qualified as &#8220;organically raised cattle,&#8221; in order to produce organic beef products on a commercial scale. &#160;

The key features of the co-operative farming model are set out in the illustration below:

&#160;

&#160;

As of the date of this report, SJAP has established 22 farmer co-operatives that have the capacity to fatten up to 20,000 head of cattle per year based on a 3-month turn-around program. The cost of rearing cattle is expected to be lower as a result of concentrating efforts on manufacturing and/or selling livestock feed. The regional farmers are contracted to grow crops and pasture for the Company using the Company&#8217;s land that has been provided lease-free by the local Government or by using their own land, the Company&#8217;s equipment operated by its workers for planting and harvesting, and the Company&#8217;s supervision and associated services, as well as seed and organic fertilizer. These items are provided to them on credit, which are then charged against their account when the Company purchases the crops and pasture grass from them in return. Regional farmers also raise cattle for the Company using its bulk and concentrated livestock feed under the same credit terms and conditions described above. That is, when the Company purchases the mature cattle from the regional farmers, their accounts are charged for the feed against the amount paid.

&#160;

2. The Organic Chain: (Organic Beef Product and Supply Chain) The Company prepares its agricultural wastes into bioorganic fertilizer. 1 Also the livestock feed 2 is prepared into bioorganic livestock feed. Bioorganic fertilizer and the bio-organic livestock feed is sold to farmers that work on the Company&#8217;s land-use rights, which is owned by the government and leased with a subsidy or rent free, due to the many benefits for the community. Fertilizer and livestock feed is are prepared based on the Company&#8217;s patented enzyme. The use of the enzyme is synergistic, as the production of fertilizer and livestock feed is permissible all 12 months of the year, which is a competitive advantage.

&#160;

The farmers use the bioorganic fertilizer on the soil and feed the grain to the cows together with the livestock feed. Government tests show:

&#160;

&#183; Additional average weight gain per head of fattening cattle; &#183; Additional fresh milk is produced; &#160;

&#160;

1 Through the environmental friendly &#8220;Bacterial and Bio-organic Fertilizer Manufacturing Technology&#8221;

2 Consists of raw material consisting of crop wastes as well as locally grown and available wild wheat plus wild wheat sterns, wild peas with sterns and leaves, and selective pastures grown in the wild. These raw materials will be finely cut and put through a number of aging and fermentation processes by adopting a technology and method called &#8220;Stock Feed Manufacturing Technology,&#8221; duly licensed by TRW, a 100 percent owned subsidiary of the Company, and catalyzed by the enzyme developed by SJAP. Thereafter, the end materials will be packed and sealed in airtight and weatherproof packaging ready for storage.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; All feeds are much easier to digest resulting in much cleaner environment in the cattle yards and houses; &#183; No ill effects were recorded due to the Company&#8217;s feed; &#183; All cattle preferred to eat the Company&#8217;s feed and were reluctant to revert back to the consumption of their old feed after they had consumed the Company&#8217;s feed during the period. &#160;

Through an acquired patent, 3 the fat content of a 15 month-old cattle can be decreased from 15 kg to 5 kg, which improves the quality of the meat and its yield. The inventor of the patent is now an equity partner in SJAP.

&#160;

3. Feed On February 28, 2013, SJAP completed its development of the Concentrated Livestock Feed (&#8220; CLF &#8221;) manufacturing factory, and started the production and sales of CLF. This CLF complements SJAP&#8217;s bulk livestock feed to provide the local cattle and sheep farming industry with a completed feed formula that can cater to the rearing of cattle and sheep at various growing cycles (e.g., specially formulated mixes with efficient nutrients for dairy cows and sheep, weaning, fattening and mature cattle and sheep). The advantage of the formulated feed combination is that the cattle and sheep growers will realize cost savings in production knowing precisely the amount of concentrated feed that will be needed by their livestock, thus avoiding wasted excess concentrated feed due to over feeding, which results in worthless excess fat in mature animals. In this respect, the Chinese central government has placed an order with SJAP to reserve up to 5,000 MT of CLF annually as part of the country&#8217;s annual reserve emergency livestock feed inventory. Thus, since March 2013 onward, SJAP has generated additional revenue generated from the sales of CLF. 

&#160;

SJAP sells its organic fertilizer and bulk livestock feed mainly to its cooperative and regional farmers in addition to using it to rear its own grown cattle, but because its geographic location is so far away from other major provinces there are high costs associated with selling its fertilizer, bulk livestock feed and live cattle other than to local purchasers. Conversely, equivalent imports from other provinces must be purchased at a higher cost, providing SJAP with a competitive edge. Furthermore, Qinghai Province is a region rearing millions of cattle and sheep per year, providing an ample market for SJAP&#8217;s fertilizer and livestock feed. 

&#160;

In the longer term, the Company believes that wholesale prices of SJAP&#8217;s livestock feed will maintain a steady growth rate of 5% to 10% per annum influenced mainly by rising labor cost of the country.

&#160;

4. Value Added Processing and distribution In 2014 the Company initiated operations in slaughter and deboning services to farmers at its abattoir and deboning facilities. SJAP received a business permit from the Chinese authorities on April 17, 2013, and construction commenced on April 21, 2013 on the abattoir, deboning factory, and related packaging facility. Since it is rare and difficult to obtain a permit for an abattoir facility in China, having this facility is expected to become a very valuable asset for the Company. To date, SJAP&#8217;s abattoir, deboning factory and packaging facilities are fully operational.

&#160;

Before the abattoir and related facilities were operational, the Company sold mostly live cattle to or through various cattle wholesalers to existing wholesale and distribution markets that did not require much marketing efforts and networking.

&#160;

In China, beef is customarily distributed through various tiers of established wholesalers and distributors that source their beef from various slaughter and deboning houses located across many districts in China. Most of these wholesalers sell multiple types of frozen or freshly chilled meats (including pork and poultry, etc.), and some slaughterhouses specialize in and solely supply beef. These wholesalers and distributors supply beef to regional supermarket chain stores, retailing wet and frozen food markets, the catering industry, etc. Therefore, after having established its own slaughterhouse and deboning factory, SJAP is expected to automatically become the primary supplier of beef. As such, many existing wholesalers and distributors will source their beef supplies directly from the Company. With the current ever increasing demands of quality beef meats due to the increase of middle class consumers, the Government&#8217;s enforcement of food safety regulation, and of anti-smuggling and illegal imports of beef, the right opportunity exists for SJAP to market its high-quality beef product. Therefore, the Company is confident it will successfully sell its beef meats in domestic markets. Also, a portion was exported to South Asian countries (i.e., Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Middle East countries and Thailand etc.) in 2014, as the Local Government encourages the Company to do.

&#160;

The following table shows the current average mark-up margin for most of the sellers and operators in the beef trade in China:

*The Company&#8217;s own sales distribution outlets will include the development and operation of the following:

&#160;

&#183; 1st and 2nd Tier Wholesale and Distribution Network directly competing with, and supplying to, existing local wholesalers. &#183; Distribution and service networking into supermarket chains, restaurant chains and domestic distributors. &#183; Franchising of &#8220;Bull&#8221; Restaurants that will sell the Company&#8217;s own beef and beef products &#160;

Currently the Company&#8217;s &#8220;Bull&#8221; restaurant serves as a demonstration model. Converted from an old cattle house, and situated next to the renovated cattle houses at SJAP&#8217;s complex, the &#8220;Bull&#8221; restaurant seats over 130 and uses on average one head of cattle every three days.

&#160;

The Company assumes that in big cities, compared to the small community of Huangyuan where the demonstration restaurant is located, a similar restaurant must have the capacity to use up to at least two head of cattle per day, equal to 730 head per year. Therefore, if and when the Company develops additional &#8220;Bull&#8221; restaurants, it is anticipated realizing sales of up to 36,500 head of cattle in a year, which is more than SJAP targets to slaughter in 2016 (i.e., 30,000 head).

&#160;

The table below lists some of the biggest wholesale frozen food (including beef) markets in Tier 1 cities (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou City) from which there are many established logistic services to channel frozen goods to other Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where many existing localized wholesalers and distributors are situated and operating:

Note: the Company intends to acquire an existing wholesale establishment in each of these Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 Cities to be its main sales and distribution outlets, and as its main regional sales administration centers. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

With the slaughterhouse, deboning and value added processing facilities (&#8220; VAF &#8221;) operational since Q1 2014, the Company expects rapid growth of revenue and profits for SJAP, thereafter.

&#160;

The combined operation of SJAP achieved sales revenues of USD144.6 million in 2015 compared to USD102.04 million in 2014, representing a growth rate of 41.7 %.

&#160;

Overall, SJAP expects that revenues from operations will multiply and increase rapidly as a result of the addition of further herds, and of comprehensive value added processing and marketing facilities.

&#160;

In this respect, SJAP&#8217;s fully owned subsidiary Qinghai Zhong He Meat Company (or QZH, the company that operates the VAF) increased sales revenue by USD 44.3 million or 336% from 2014&#8217;s USD13.2 million to 2015&#8217;s USD 57.6 million and generated gross profit of USD15.1 million in 2015 compared to USD3.9 million in 2014.

&#160;

In 2014, the Company expected a trend of continuous increases in beef and cattle prices given the increase in demand for quality beef and beef products (including value-added products) in tandem with the rise of living standards in China, the short supply of quality breeding stock that will be required to produce enough cattle to satisfy the increased demand. However, this prediction turned out to be wrong because the Chinese government changed its beef import policy during the 2 nd quarter of 2015 relaxing the restriction on beef imports from eleven countries (e.g., New Zealand, Brazil, Australia, etc.), which started to affect the local cattle and beef industry primarily due to the drop of local cattle and beef prices from June 2016 as supplies were increasing rapidly while the growth rate of China&#8217;s middle-class did not keep pace in such a short space of time; (i.e., early months 2015 averaged wholesale prices for live weight cattle was at about RMB32 / Kg and it went as low as to RMB20 / Kg by December 2015).

&#160;

In this respect, SJAP&#8217;s overall cattle division (excluding QZH) achieved sales revenue of USD86.97 million in 2015 compared to 2014&#8217;s USD88.8 million (representing a negative growth rate of -1.86%) and gross profit dropped to USD18.25 million from 2014&#8217;s USD26.95 million (representing a drop of 32.3%).

&#160;

In order that the impact of said governmental change of policy affecting the local cattle and beef industry could be minimized, the Company decided to implement the following business plan and direction ( the &#8220; Program &#8221;):

&#160;

&#8226; Increase its VAP activities by importing more beef from other countries (Australia and Brazil, etc.); &#160;

&#8226; Upgrade its cattle herd by 2018 aiming at annual production thereon at rates of 3,000 head of Wagyu cattle, 2,500 head of 500-day grain fed angus and 2,500 head of pure organically grown angus, thus reducing its current cattle herd makeup gradually down to zero by 2018 starting from last quarter of 2015; &#160;

&#8226; To add more value added processing lines of activities (i.e. canning division etc.) to gain more export sales apart from its domestic sales; &#160;

&#8226; To expand its marketing network to cover major cities of nearby provinces that collectively have more than 350 million in population; and &#160;

&#8226; To train and to recruit suitable human resources effectively and efficiently. &#160;

The Program will involve additional capital expenditure and working capital over a 3-year period; as such, the Company may divest SJAP and list it as a stand-alone entity on a Chinese Stock Exchange such that it will be able to raise capital to finance the development needs of the Program. There can be no assurance that the Company will ultimately pursue this plan or, if it does, when such a spin-off would occur.

&#160;

Organic Fertilizer (HSA) division 

The business division Organic Fertilizer refers to the operations of the subsidiary HSA in Linli District, Hunan Province. Revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was USD 20 million, or 5.9 percent of the Company&#8217;s total sales of goods revenue of USD 336.8 million in the same period. Gross profit for the Organic Fertilizer division for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was USD8.5 million, or 11.2 percent of the Company&#8217;s total gross profit for sales of goods of USD 75.9 million in the same period.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The operation in Linli District, Hunan Province, is run by HSA, a 76% owned Chinese subsidiary. HSA conducts the following business activities, both of which are in the development stage:

&#160;

&#183; manufacturing and sales of organic and mixed fertilizer, &#183; cultivation of pastures and crops in preparation for the establishment of beef cattle farms, and &#183; rearing of beef cattle &#160;

By January 2013, the first organic fertilizer production plant was established and started its production of organic fertilizer. On March 5, 2013, HSA secured the rights to use an enzyme developed by a Hong Kong company some twenty years ago that has been utilized by global manufacturers of organic fertilizer. The advantage of this particular enzyme is that when it is applied to the organic fertilizer it has the ability to convert part of the organic raw materials into potash and phosphate without having to add in chemically formulated potash and phosphate, such that the Company&#8217;s end fertilizer can be qualified as pure organic fertilizer made with 100% natural organic raw materials. With this pure organic fertilizer, HSA is in a position to fully explore the potential market for fish in farm lakes and thereby to attempt to align itself with the government&#8217;s policy of encouraging lake fish farmers to use pure organic fertilizer instead of chemical fertilizers. In addition, cost savings from avoiding the use of chemical potash and phosphate will, in management&#8217;s belief, result in a better profit margin for the Company. Sales of pure organic fertilizer commenced at the end of Q1 2013.

&#160;

Currently, chemical fertilizers in the region are sold at wholesale between RMB 3,000 to 3,600 per MT depending upon their chemical composition, compared to organic fertilizer from HSA selling at an average of RMB 1,200 to RMB 1,300 per MT. The Company&#8217;s new 100% pure organic fertilizer with up to 8% potash is currently being marketed between RMB 2,000 to RMB 2,200 per MT targeting to reach an average up to RMB2,600 per MT such that its prices will be at the mid-range between organic and chemical fertilizer.

&#160;

HSA produced 50,000 MT of organic fertilizer and organic mixed fertilizer in 2014 under its newly completed production plant and facilities, and aims to ultimately increase its capacity to about 90,000 MT per year in stages. The main hardship related to selling fertilizer is the requirement to provide longer credit terms (sometimes up to 180 days) to the Company&#8217;s end buyers because these end users normally can afford to pay for them only after they sell their products. Therefore, the Company must assess creditworthiness of its prospective customers, and only consider the farmers who can be deemed creditworthy, and who follow the Company&#8217;s requirements for planting their fields and harvesting crops each year.

&#160;

Development of HSA in Linli District, Hunan Province, follows SJAP&#8217;s business model. HSA is situated in a much better growing environment than SJAP, a farming rich province in central China. Thus, HSA benefits from cheaper logistics costs, close proximity to large markets, and a more favorable climate (milder winters and longer summers versus SJAP&#8217;s long bitterly cold winters and short summers). However, financial support from the Government is more difficult to obtain in the Hunan Province because more entities share the Government&#8217;s support provisions.

&#160;

HSA endures both higher development costs and longer time to construct its facilities when compared to SJAP, whose property had 40 older (yet salvageable) buildings, which it has renovated to meet its needs.

&#160;

Hunan Province is one of the biggest primary producing provinces of China with over four million primary producers that grow rice, tea, tobacco, grapes, citrus, cotton, seedlings, sunflowers, herb plants and many varieties of cash crops. Hunan also has a long-standing history in lake aquaculture producing millions of tons of fish and other seafood annually (e.g., total primary production is over RMB 450 Billion, or about USD 75 Billion, recorded in 2011 as announced by Hunan Province Agriculture Department).

&#160;

At the Company&#8217;s newly built fertilizer factory, the 100% pure organic mixed fertilizer (&#8220; POMF &#8221;) is generating stable income and revenues reached targets in 2015 of over 13,037 MT of Organic Fertilizer, 36,232 MT of Organic Mixed Fertilizer and 180 MT of retailed packed fertilizer, collectively amounting to just under 50,000 MT.

&#160;

Construction work to develop HSA&#8217;s cattle station that began in March 2012 with preparation work on its general layout is now, as of December 2015, a 2,000 head capacity cattle farm built and ready for operation. The Company cultivated 75 acres of its land, situated below the fertilizer factory, and planted crops and pasture.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s plan for HSA is to process cattle waste from its own cattle farm to be used as raw materials for the manufacturing of fertilizer, thus there will be substantial saving in its cost of fertilizer manufacturing (estimated at over USD2.5 million per year based on current sales), and with such cost of saving, HSA will be able to self-finance the development of its Yellow Cattle Program designed to eventually produce the Yellow Cattle into one of the top quality beef cattle in Asia, aiming to reach meat quality on par with Japanese Wagyu Cattle.

&#160;

Therefore the Company&#8217;s plan is to merge Cattle Farm (1) &#38; (2) with HSA sometime in 2016 or 2017, at the latest, such that CF (1 &#38; 2) will be the breeding station to supply yearlings for HSA to grow into full grown cattle (up to 3 years old) that will be sold in the Chinese market. The Yellow Cattle is very similar in body size and weight and quality to the Japanese Wagyu cattle and has distinct meat texture, flavor and quality that are in high demand in China.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Cattle farms (MEIJI) division 

The business division Cattle Farms, or MEIJI, refers to SIAF&#8217;s cattle rearing operations in Jiangmen, Guangdong Province. Revenue for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 was USD 35.3 million, or 10.5 percent, of the Company&#8217;s total sales of goods revenue of USD 336.8 million in the same period. Gross profit for the Cattle Farm (MEIJI) division for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was USD 1.9 million, or 2.5 percent of the Company&#8217;s total gross profit on sales of goods of USD 75.9 million in the same period.

&#160;

Currently there are two operations in this segment, Cattle Farm 1 and Cattle Farm 2. Sales for 2015 amounted to 14,947 head of cattle.

&#160; 

Cattle Farm 1: Cattle Farm 1 was built as a demonstration farm to show that cattle can be raised in a semi-tropical climate using the Company&#8217;s semi-grazing and housing method. Using the Company&#8217;s semi-free growing management system, the cattle are allowed to graze in the field during the early morning and kept indoors and out of the sun during the hot summer days. This method has proven reliable, with the growth rate of the cattle measuring slightly higher than the cattle at SJAP (i.e., averaging around 0.28 kg per day per cattle more).

&#160;

Cattle Farm 2: Cattle Farm 2 is a beef cattle farm situated in Guangdong Province, Guangzhou City. Cattle Farm 2 is operated by a private company formed in China with Chinese citizens acting as its legal representative as required by Chinese law. EAPBCF will become a Sino Agro Food subsidiary when its SFJVC is officially formed. This is expected to occur during 2016 or 2017 pending availability of free cash flow of the Company; however, no guarantee can be made that the SFJVC will be formed.

&#160;

Cattle Farm 2 is complementary to Cattle Farm 1, having an additional 76 acres of land suitable for growing the Company&#8217;s type of pasture (a cross between elephant grass and yellow grass) that has a very high yield rate of over 35 MT per 1/6 acre per year, and containing an average of over 9 percent protein that is very suitable for consumption by cattle. Between the two farms, under normal seasons, they have a capacity to produce up to 30,000 MT of pasture/year collectively that is capable to feed up to 5,000 head of cattle/year based on the consumption rate on average of 6 MT/head.

&#160;

MEIJI is the marketing and distribution agent for all cattle farms that are and will be developed by MEIJI using its &#8220;Semi-free growing&#8221; management systems and aromatic-feed programs and systems to grow beef cattle.

&#160;

Similar to CA in its business model, MEIJI purchases fully-grown cattle from Cattle Farm 1 and sells them to the cattle wholesalers. MEIJI also buys young cattle from other farmers and sells the young stock to Cattle Farm 1. All cattle farms developed by MEIJI will utilize its &#8220;semi-free growing&#8221; management system and aromatic-feed programs and systems to raise beef cattle.

&#160;

Yellow Cattle (Beef meat) is traditionally a high-end market in China, as it is mainly sold in higher end markets. This situation is rapidly changing, though, owing to urbanization and rising incomes, the rising demand for such quality beef, such that we foresee that eventually, locally grown and produced high quality beef from local breeds like the Yellow Cattle will establish its &#8220;Brand&#8221; and in turn premium prices in China similar to how many locally bred Japanese Cattle found their market niches in Japan.

&#160;

Plantation division 

The business division Plantation refers to SIAF&#8217;s produce production situated at Enping City, Guangdong Province. Revenue for 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was USD 13.7 million or 4 percent of the Company&#8217;s total sales of goods revenue of USD 336.8 million in the same period. Gross profit for the Organic Fertilizer division for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was USD 9.3 million, or 12.2 percent of the Company&#8217;s total gross profit for sales of goods of USD 75.9 million in the same period.

&#160;

JHST is an SFJVC that is 75 percent owned by SIAF. Situated at Enping City, Guangdong Province, it is consolidated as a subsidiary, and is the owner and operator of a Plantation where mainly Hylocereus Undatus, or Dragon Fruit, is grown.

&#160;

Hylocereus Undatus is a cactus commonly referred to as dragon fruit. JHST conducts two main operations: (i) growth and sales of flowers that are consumed as vegetables in China, and (ii) drying and value added processing and sales of HU flower products (used in health-related soups and teas). JHST cultivates 187 acres of Hylocereus Undatus in the Guangdong Province.

&#160;

HU cacti take three years to reach maturity, though they will flower a little even in their first year, and can produce for as long as twenty years. JHST began planting in late 2007, and by 2015 all of the plants are mature (averaging over four years). HU blooms for a very short period, sometimes only one night, and flowers must be 20 to 25 cm long when picked before they turn from green to white. HU is a delicate crop and the harvest season runs from July through October.

&#160;

Fresh flowers are sold to regional wholesale and retail markets due to their short shelf life. Some are dried and packed; these flowers are sold to a few major wholesalers, who distribute them to wholesale and retail markets and export traders through the winter and spring months (from October to June) in Guangdong Province. HU is a seasonal revenue product; more than half of JHST&#8217;s revenues are recognized in the third quarter. No sales are made in the first quarter.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company originally expected that by 2014, dried and pickled flowers would make up 96 percent of the division&#8217;s flower income as produce is diverted away from delicate fresh flowers. In 2013, the Company planted a special selenium-rich Chinese herb (called XueYingZi, or &#8220;Immortal Vegetable&#8221; in China, and Snowsakurako in Japan) among the HU plants hoping to prolong the shelf life of the fresh flowers from 2-3 days up to 12-14 days and increasing the sales of fresh flowers. This did not occur, so that the Company processed up to 80 percent of HU as dried flowers in 2013. The Company&#8217;s organic Immortal Vegetable plants have properties that some believe induce good health. The Company has processed these into small gift packs - selling them as organic vegetables with leaves for tea and stems for soup. Laboratory test results show that each kilo of fresh Immortal Vegetables contains 0.58 gram of selenium, which adds value to their sales. In December 2013, the Company started trials to plant other cash crops in between the HU plants with the aim of improving revenue covering all seasons. As of the date of this Annual Report there are 70 Mu Immortal vegetables on the plantation being cultivated in and generating revenue for the HU plantation.

&#160;

HU flowers are in greater demand than supply can meet for several reasons; (i) In Guangdong Province, HU plants can only be grown commercially along certain districts; there were over 40,000 acres of HU Plantation in 2005, but due to the growth of industrialization and modernization, acreage is now less than 4,000 acres, and (ii) farm laborers are getting harder to find. With the increase of cost of wages and salaries, the rapid rise of the land cost and the increase cost of farm developments, it is extremely difficult to start up a big acreage HU plantation. For these reasons the Company anticipates that prices of dried HU flowers will enjoy a steady rise at an average rate of 8 to 12 percent per year, which has been the trend since 2009. However, the biggest risk to yield is weather, as substantially wet rainy seasons can limit the yield of any harvest.

&#160;

The Company is planning to merge the plantation with a health and herbal Company that has chains of health food shops and to change the plantation into a producer of selenium rich and calcium rich health products using the HU flowers and immortal plants as its core produce within 2016, subsequently to spin it off as an independent company listed on a suitable stock exchange aiming to obtain optimal returns beneficial to the Company&#8217;s shareholders.

&#160;

Marketing &#38; Trading Division 

Revenue for 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was USD 37.9 million or 11.2 percent of the Company&#8217;s total sales of goods revenue of USD 336.8 million in the same period. Gross profit for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was USD 4.74 million or 6.25 percent of the Company&#8217;s total gross profit for sales of goods of USD 75.9 million in the same period.

&#160;

The Company distributes imported meat and seafood through two completed and operational facilities from which it has acted as turnkey project developer to construct and manage these operations:

&#160;

1) Wholesale and distribution facilities ( &#8220;Wholesale Center 1&#8221; ) for Guangzhou City NaWei Trading Co. Ltd ( &#8220;NWT&#8221; ), an unrelated Chinese third party owned company situated at the Guangzhou City, LiWan District, New Wholesale Market. &#160;

2) The Shanghai Distribution Center which was built to accommodate a capacity of 50 metric tons of meat per day and to distribute 5,000 metric tons of seafood within two years. &#160;

In 2013, the Company also constructed a trading complex (the &#8220;Trading Center&#8221;) for the Import and Export at another building adjacent to Wholesale Centers 1 and 2. The Trading Center has imported frozen and fresh chilled and live seafood (i.e., cuttlefish, squid, prawns, salmon, crabs and eels) from Malaysia, Thailand, Russia and Madagascar and other local coastal fishing towns. The seafood was sold to Wholesale Center 1, which distributed and sold it into various reputable food chain outlets, wholesale market stores and supermarket chains in the Guangzhou City, Shanghai City as well as in the southern coastal towns of the Guangdong Province.

&#160;

Primarily, the Company distributes meat imported from Australia and seafood from Madagascar through these operations, with an expanding number of suppliers from other countries.

&#160;

Project Development Division 

&#160;

In 2015, there were project developments (or Technology engineering consulting and services) work carried out by CA on aquaculture related projects and by SIAF on non-aquaculture projects:

&#160;

Introduction 

The Project Development division earns revenue by providing turnkey project management and engineering services today mainly within aquaculture. Project development revenue for 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was USD 92.3 million or 21.5 percent of the Company&#8217;s total revenue of USD 429 million in the same period. Gross profit for project development for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 was USD 35.2 million or 31.7 percent of the Company&#8217;s total gross profit of USD 111 million in the same period. All project development activity for the year was carried out through Capital Award for the aquaculture division.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Intellectual Property Rights

The Company and its business are, to some extent, dependent on patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company holds intellectual property for fertilizer formulas, livestock feed fermenting formulas and indoor fish farm techniques. These include an enzyme technology master license registered under a Chinese patent for the manufacturing of livestock feed and bioorganic fertilizer, and an aromatic-feed formula technology for the production of aromatic cattle. Further, Sino Agro Food holds a &#8220;master license&#8221; in China for &#8220;A Power Technology&#8221; (for further information, see the section entitled &#8220;Material agreements &#8211; License rights&#8221;), a modular on-land fish growing system and technology based on a re-circulating aquaculture system, as well as a license to exploit sleep cod breeding technology to grow out sleep cod and a bacterial cellulose technology license.

&#160;

On 12 November 2008, Tri-way Industries Limited entered into a Sales and Purchase of Technology Master License Agreement with the inventor of a patent, Mr Shan Dezhang, concerning the sale and purchase of the master licence rights of a patent registered in China under the name of &#8220;Zhi Wu Jei Gan Si Liao Chan Ye Hua Ji Qi Zhi Bei Fang Fa&#8221;, with patent number ZL200510063039.9. The patent relates to methods of processing plant straw into animal fodder and industrialisation of product of plant straw fodder. Under the agreement, Tri-way Industries Limited is licenced to use and to licence others to use the secrets, copyrights processes and other intellectual property rights associated with the patent in any territories in the world free from all encumbrances with all rights to the patented intellectual property and related brand and label as provided under the laws of China. The total purchase price of the patent was USD 8,000,000, to be paid in several installments. As Tri-way Industries Limited is not a Chinese company, relevant Chinese authorities must under applicable Chinese law, approve the assignment. The patent assignment has not been registered. Consequently, under Chinese law, the patent shall not take priority over the interests of third parties who are in good faith.

&#160;

On 15 May 2009, Tri-way Industries Limited (as licensor) entered into a sub-licence agreement with Qinghai Sanjiang A Power Agriculture Co. Ltd (as licensee) concerning the sub-licensing of the above-mentioned patent (ZL200510063039.9). The licence period is 50 years, and the annual licence fee is stipulated at USD 450,000. However, as effective patent protection for the patent is 20 years, the excess part of the term is void under Chinese law. The contracting parties of the aforesaid sub-licence agreement have never performed the terms of the said agreement and no payment has ever been made by the licensee to the licensor. The parties have no intention to perform the sub-licence agreement, and the contracting parties have terminated the said agreement accordingly.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On 20 June 2011, SJAP entered into an agreement with Guangzhou City Garwor Trading Company Limited, pursuant to which Guangzhou City Garwor Trading Company Limited transferred its trademarks with registration numbers, 3713869 and 3713868, as well as a microbial patent with patent number ZL200610033295.8. The total transfer fee for the trademarks and the patent was RMB 12 million and the transfer fee for the technology secrets was RMB 1 million. According to the said agreement, the transfer fees shall be paid by the interest generated from the utilization of the patent. Moreover, the said agreement stipulates that any new technology improvements of the invention shall belong to both parties, and that any resulting profits shall be shared equally. Guangzhou City Garwor Trading Company Limited is a shareholder in the transferee and therefore a related party. An evaluation report was not filed with the transaction. Although this is not a formal requirement under Chinese law and the contract is valid, this may lead to the contract being challenged in the future on the basis of unfairness. Moreover, as the transferor, Guangzhou City Garwor Trading Company Limited, is not the owner of the trademark, the said agreement is void under Chinese law and SJAP has therefore not obtained ownership of the aforementioned trademarks. This may be corrected if and when SJAP enters into an agreement with the trademark owner. If SJAP uses the trademark without prior consent of the trademark owner, this would constitute trademark infringement. However, SJAP is intending to write off said trademark, and does not intend to use the trademark in question.

&#160;

Euro China Capital Convertible Note :

On August 29, 2014 the Company completed the closing of a private placement financing transaction with an accredited investor, Euro China Capital AB (&#8220; ECAB &#8221;), which purchased a 10.5% convertible note (the &#8220; Note &#8221;) in the aggregate principal amount of up to USD 33,300,000. The Company received a total advance of USD 25 million. The Note carries an original issue discount of 25%.

&#160;

Interest on the Note shall accrue on the outstanding principal balance of the Note from August 29, 2014. Interest shall be payable quarterly on the last day of each of March, June, September and December commencing September 30, 2014 provided, however, that the Noteholder may elect to require the Company to issue to the Noteholder a promissory note in lieu of cash in satisfaction of any interest due and payable at such time. Any interest payment note shall be subject to the same terms as the Note. The Note has a maturity date of February 28, 2020.

&#160;

The Note is convertible, at the discretion of the Noteholder, into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (i) at any time following an event of default, or (ii) for a period of thirty (30) calendar days following October 1, 2015 and each anniversary thereof, at an initial conversion price per share of USD 9.90, subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends and other similar transactions and subject to the terms of the Note. As long as the Note is outstanding, the Noteholder shall have a right of first refusal, exercisable for thirty (30) calendar days after notice to the Noteholder, to make loans to the Company and its subsidiaries or to purchase securities proposed to be offered and sold by the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company is required to promptly give the Noteholder written notice of such proposed transaction.

&#160;

The Note agreement contains regular provisions requiring timely repayment of principal and accrued interest, payment of default interest in the event of default, default and optional conversion and does not contain specific financial covenants. To the Company&#8217;s knowledge, the Company is in material compliance with the terms of the Note.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Loan agreements 

All the loan agreements set out above under the heading &#8220;Borrowings, loans receivables and contractual obligations&#8221; in the tables above contain regular provisions requiring timely repayment of principal amount and accrued interest, payment of default interest in the event of default, and contain no specific financial covenants. To the Company&#8217;s knowledge, the Company is currently in compliance with the loan agreements.

&#160;

There are no provisions in the Company&#8217;s bank borrowings and long term debts that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company&#8217;s business. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par.

&#160;

Under the terms of the loan agreements with Agricultural Development Bank of China, proposed changes in the shareholding of SJAP requires 30-days prior written notice and prior approval from the Agricultural Development Bank of China. However, this will not be triggered by indirect changes or changes in the shareholding of the Company.

&#160;

Material Agreements

&#160;

Joint Venture Agreements 

The Company has two types of SFJVCs established under Chinese law:

&#160;

&#183; Contractual Joint Ventures (&#8220; CJV &#8221;); and &#183; Equity Joint Ventures (&#8220; EJV &#8221;). &#160;

Of the five Chinese joint venture project companies which are CJVs or EJVs, four are CJVs (JFD, JHMC, JHST, SJAP) and one is an EJV (HSA). 4 

&#160;

The main difference between an EJV and a CJV is that in a CJV, the obligation of capital contribution shall be determined by the contractual parties themselves. The proportions of capital contribution do not have to be fixed between the Chinese and foreign parties. Profit distribution and risk sharing ratio shall also be determined by the contracting parties themselves which do not have to be the same proportions as the parties&#8217; capital contribution or shareholding therein. The capital contributing parties may specify their profit and risk sharing ratio only and may or may not specify their shareholdings in the CJV. One party may make capital contribution by way of non-monetary assets such as rights in lands, factories and machineries etc. while the other party may make capital contribution by way of cash.

&#160;

In an EJV, the shareholders contribute capital and operate business jointly, and share profits, risks and losses in proportion to their equity contributions. Foreign investor&#8217;s capital contribution shall not be less than 25 percent of the total registered capital.

&#160;

&#160;

4 According to the official documents of Sino Agro Food&#8217;s Chinese subsidiary JHMC, the registered capital of such subsidiary is USD 2 million that was paid in full by year ended 31 December 2014. As of the date of this Annual Report, MEIJI, a subsidiary of Sino Agro Food, has contributed USD 400,000 of the subscribed capital, whereas USD 1.6 million of the subscribed capital has not been paid. Moreover, according to the official documents of Sino Agro Food&#8217;s Chinese subsidiary HSA, the registered capital of such subsidiary is USD 2.5 million and shall be paid in full no later than 18 July 2013. As of the date of this Annual Report, MEIJI, a subsidiary of Sino Agro Food, has contributed USD 865,000 of the subscribed capital, whereas USD 234,500 of the subscribed capital has not been paid by the Chinese owner. The aforementioned deadlines can be re-arranged by all the promoters. If no new deadline is agreed upon, failure by MEIJI to make full payment may lead to the other promoters making full payment of the capital contribution on MEIJI&#8217;s behalf and requesting MEIJI to compensate for their payment and losses. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company engages in projects based on consulting and service agreements (as described under &#8220;Consulting and Services agreements&#8221; below), whereby Sino Agro Food can choose whether the cooperation shall continue under a consulting and service agreement or be acquired by Sino Agro Food.

&#160;

Consulting and Services Agreement 

Consulting and service (&#8220; C&#38;S &#8221;) agreements are important for the operation of Sino Agro Food&#8217;s subsidiaries and partners. Only the Sino Agro Food subsidiaries SJAP and HSA do not and have not operated under C&#38;S agreements.

&#160;

Initially, agriculture and aquaculture investors invite Sino Agro Food to act as a developer and project manager of an agribusiness or food-related project. If the management of Sino Agro Food sees the proposal as interesting, Sino Agro Food carries out an in-depth study of the target company including legal due diligence, business plan, budget and projected financial information. Sino Agro Food makes the decision through a resolution of the Board of Directors. If Sino Agro Food determines to proceed, the Chinese investor forms a private Chinese company dedicated to the project and the parties sign a C&#38;S agreement.

&#160;

Sino Agro Food acts as the project manager providing turnkey services to the Chinese developer of the project, meaning that Sino Agro Food builds the project using Sino Agro Food&#8217;s technology, systems, know-how, and management expertise and systems. As such, Sino Agro Food&#8217;s expenditure in the project includes Sino Agro Food&#8217;s own administration and operational expenses provided for and incurred in the project (charged and recorded under Sino Agro Food&#8217;s general and administrative operation expenses), which are billed to the Chinese developer. All other development expenditures (inclusive of Sino Agro Food&#8217;s subcontractors&#8217; and sub-suppliers&#8217; costs and Sino Agro Food&#8217;s marked up profits) are billed to the Chinese developer who will pay accordingly.

&#160;

When the project company initiates production Sino Agro Food acts as the sole marketer of food products and the supplier for the C&#38;S Project Company under the terms and conditions of the C&#38;S agreement. Sino Agro Food acts as the selling supplier and buying wholesaler to the company supplying items such as feed, young cattle, and RAS technological components and buys mature prawns, sleepy cod, eels and live cattle. Sino Agro Food earns a gross profit of between 10-15 percent based on the C&#38;S Project Company&#8217;s revenue on this exclusivity.

&#160;

The C&#38;S Project Company will remain wholly-owned by the Chinese developer until Sino Agro Food exercise the acquisition option and subsequently converts the company into an SFJVC where the Chinese investor remains as a minority shareholder. The acquisition price is normally determined in accordance with the book value of the Chinese company as of the acquisition date. Consideration will normally consist partly of cash and partly of project loans owed by the Chinese investor, which offset and decrease the purchase proceeds in the corresponding amount. Generally, the agreements that Sino Agro Food has entered into governing the formation of the unincorporated companies into SFJVCs do not regulate the maturity date for the formation of SFJVC. The date for the formation of the SFJVC is generally left to the discretion of the Company, based on the development and profitability of the relevant project.

&#160;

As of the date of this Annual Report, Sino Agro Food has entered into ten C&#38;S agreements. A portion of the C&#38;S agreements contain an acquisition premium clause, in which the accumulated C&#38;S project development fees billed by Sino Agro Food will be paid in addition to the equity book value at the time of acquisition. In the event that either of the investors decides to sell all or part of its equity in the SFJVC to any third party, a portion of the agreements require the selling investor to obtain prior consent of the other investor before such sale and to grant the right of first refusal to the other investor on the like terms for the intended sale.

&#160;

Sino Agro Food targets to acquire a number of the C&#38;S project companies in which the Company is currently involved. These contemplated acquisitions are dependent upon Sino Agro Food&#8217;s availability of cash for financing and obtaining the relevant approval by Chinese authorities to form the SFJVCs. To date, two out of ten project companies have been acquired and transformed to SFJVC&#8217;s.

&#160;

Land leases 

Private ownership of land is not permitted in China. Therefore, Sino Agro Food leases land that is either collectively owned land or state owned land, through land use rights. Corporate entities and individuals may own the property (buildings) erected on the land.

&#160;

Land use rights may be transferred, but they are based on agricultural contracts and cannot be changed arbitrarily to non-agricultural purposes. The lease term varies from 27 to 60 years. There are certain uncertainties (e.g., lease term may not exceed 30 years and all transfers have not yet been registered correctly) in respect of certain leased land due to the fact that not all requirements have been fulfilled or not yet registered. However, the Company believes it is protected against these uncertainties through its agreements with the relevant local Chinese partners and relevant registration processes have been initiated. The Company&#8217;s subsidiary HSA has acquired land use rights for state owned land located in OuChi Village, FengHuo Town, LinLi County, Hunan Province. However, HSA has not obtained a land use right certificate for such land, which therefore, for the time being, cannot be lawfully mortgaged or transferred. Moreover, the Company&#8217;s subsidiary CA has entered into a Rural Land Management Rights Sub-Sales Agreement for the acquisition of the contractual operating and use rights of 202 mu of collective owned land located in Da San Dui Wei You Nan Village, Shenwan Town, Zhongshan City for a period of 30 years. However, the transfer procedures for the land in question have not been completed. CA is not an enterprise registered in mainland China and therefore, according to Chinese law, cannot acquire the contractual operating and use rights of collective owned land. The Company is currently negotiating with Beijing Hengxintianyi Investment Guarantee Co. Ltd. to designate a subsidiary of the Company in China for the purpose of entering into a new Rural Land Management Rights Sub-Sales Agreement.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Spinoff

The Company has announced that it has begun the first of three or four contemplated divestitures. The Company is currently exploring various opportunities for a spinoff including a listing on Oslo Stock Exchange for a new aquaculture company, comprised of its aquaculture operations. The proposed new company would have one single share class and conform to Nordic corporate governance standards. It is targeted to include the bulk of the Company&#8217;s aquaculture operations; namely:

&#160;

&#183; Jiang Men City A Power Fishery Development Co., Ltd. (Fish Farm 1); &#160;

&#183; Enping City Bi Tao A Power Prawn Culture Development Co., Ltd. (Prawn Farm 1); &#160;

&#183; Zhongshan A Power Prawn Culture Farms Development Co., Ltd. (Prawn Farm 2), and; &#160;

&#183; Zhongshan New Prawn Project (ZSNPP) Phase 1 as well as an opportunity to acquire additional phases of the project as development continues. The ZSNPP is targeted to reach an annual production capacity of at least 200,000 metric tons over the long term. &#160;

Establishing the proposed new company would in management&#8217;s view expedite several strategic objectives:

&#160;

&#183; Simplify the structure of the Company by creating a rapidly growing, profitable aquaculture company focused on the production of seafood with unique expansion potential; &#160;

&#183; Create a company with an independent board of directors, a shareholder nomination committee, a single share class, a separate management team and auditors, dedicated reporting and investor relations functions; &#160;

&#183; Expose the new company to institutional investors with in-depth knowledge and high appreciation of aquaculture businesses. The Oslo Stock Exchange has more than 15 listed companies in the seafood sector, with a combined market capitalization of more than NOK 150 billion (approximately USD 18 billion as of the date of this Annual Report). The sector trades at an average 2015 price/earnings multiple of 10.5x; &#160;

&#183; Facilitate funding to increase ownership in existing aquaculture facilities, and; &#160;

&#183; Create an independent company to secure funding for the future development of additional stages at the significant Zhongshan New Prawn. &#160;

&#160;

Economic outlook in China 

China&#8217;s economy is at present second only to that of the United States, having overtaken Japan&#8217;s role as number two in 2010. 5 The OECD expects that China&#8217;s real GDP will grow by 6.9 percent in 2016. 6 The IMF expects that China will be the world&#8217;s largest economy in 2017 with 18.3 percent of the world economy. The United States&#8217; share of the world economy is expected to fall to 17.9 percent by 2017. 7 

&#160;

The strong growth in China has delivered major improvements in living standards and poverty has been reduced dramatically. 8 Based on the World Bank&#8217;s classification, China recently graduated from lower to upper middle-income status. A growing emphasis on improving access to health and education as well as high investment in infrastructure have helped spread the benefits of growth nationally including in rural areas, where incomes have enjoyed consistently strong gains.

&#160;

Agriculture in China 

China is the world&#8217;s largest agricultural economy. It is the leading producer of many agricultural commodities such as pork, horticultural products, rice and cotton and also the largest consumer of many agricultural products, such as pork, rice and soybeans. While China generally has been successful in meeting its rapidly rising demand for food and grains by increasing domestic production, it has emerged as a leading global importer of several agricultural commodities, including cotton, soybeans, vegetable oils, and animal hides. As its domestic agricultural production has grown, China has also become the largest exporter in global markets for several horticultural products, including mandarin oranges, apples, apple juice, garlic and other vegetables.

&#160;

China&#8217;s increasingly important position in global agricultural markets followed decades of gradual growth in domestic food production and consumption. After the introduction of market-based reforms in 1978 that included the elimination of the collective production system and relaxation of government direction over certain farmer production and marketing decisions, Chinese agricultural output grew significantly. Between 1978 and 2008, China almost doubled its production of grains (rice, wheat and corn) and quadrupled its production of meats; the production of fruit and milk was about 30 times greater in 2008 than in 1978. During these three decades, population growth of about 1 percent annually, coupled with annual per capita income growth of 8 percent, fueled a large increase in demand for more and higher-value agricultural products, especially by China&#8217;s large and growing middle class. China&#8217;s rapid growth in food consumption was largely met by domestic production growth, enabling it to remain self-sufficient in most major commodities.

&#160;

About 40 percent of China&#8217;s population of 1.3 billion is employed in the agricultural sector, and agriculture contributes about 11 percent to China&#8217;s GDP. 9 

&#160;

China&#8217;s support for agriculture 

China&#8217;s government support for agriculture is low compared to that of developed countries, such as the United States and European Union, but in line with that of other rapidly growing economies, according to USITC. As measured by the OECD&#8217;s PSE 10 , the amount of support provided to Chinese farmers was low (and sometimes negative) during the 1990&#8217;s, but gradually rose during the period 2008-2010. Compared with other countries at a similar level of development, including Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa, China&#8217;s support for farmers falls in the middle of the range. China&#8217;s PSE reflects changes in the central government&#8217;s policy priorities from grain self-sufficiency and low consumer prices toward a stronger focus on raising farm household incomes, according to USITC.

&#160;

Government support to China&#8217;s agricultural sector indicates that Chinese policymakers are placing a renewed emphasis on the rural economy. Indirect support, in the form of general services, is very high relative to similar support programs in other countries, due largely to investments in agricultural infrastructure. General services include modern research and extension services, food safety agencies, and agricultural price information services, most of which provide benefits to producers and consumers throughout the economy. Compared with direct payments to farmers, general services support is less production-distorting to the sector.

&#160;

Agricultural consumption 

China is a major global consumer of agricultural products. It consumes one-third of the world&#8217;s rice, one-fourth of all corn, and half of all pork and cotton, and it is the largest consumer of oilseeds and most edible oils. The traditional Chinese diet centers around staple foods (mainly grains and starches), which account for nearly half of the daily caloric intake. Average Chinese per capita consumption recently stabilized at approximately 3,000 calories per day, one of the highest levels among Asian countries.

&#160;

Chinese food consumption is influenced by factors such as population size and demographics, income, food prices, and general preferences. Per capita income growth and urbanization are the two factors most responsible for altering recent consumption patterns in China. Rising income translates into higher per capita food consumption, while increasing urbanization is driving diversification of food choices because of greater availability and choice offered through increasingly diverse sales outlets.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Chinese consumers generally fall into one of three categories: rural consumers; urban low-income consumers; or urban high-income consumers. Although urban high-income consumers can afford to buy more and better-quality food, the ubiquity of food outlets in cities means that nearly every urban resident, regardless of income, has available an increasingly diverse food selection. Compared to rural diets, urban diets contain less grain and more non-staple items, including processed and convenience foods. Rural migrants to cities tend to adopt the urban diet.

&#160;

Expenditure on food 

Food is the largest class of household expenditure for all Chinese income groups; even housing takes a smaller share of average household income, according to USITC. As income rises, the absolute amount of food expenditure increases, although the share of income spent on food falls. Urban residents spend substantially more on food than their rural counterparts, according to USITC. Higher incomes lead to an increase in both the quantity and quality of food demanded. However, while demand for higher quantities of food appears to level off in the top income households, demand for higher-quality foods continues to rise with income.

&#160;

Spending on food consumed outside the home is on the rise. In 2003, about 18 percent of urban household food expenditures and over 11 percent of rural household food expenditures were made outside the home. In 2008, the average per capita annual expenditure on dining out was USD 127 among urban residents, up 26 percent from a year earlier. Per capita expenditures on food consumed away from home vary among regions, with Shanghai spending the most (USD 300) and Tibet the least (USD 84). Most such expenditures are made in restaurants, both independent establishments and fast-food chains. Although consumption away from the household is increasing, most foods are still eaten at home. The exception is meat, with about half of all meat consumed outside the home.

&#160;

Food preferences 

Along with more varied consumption, higher incomes are leading to changing food preferences, including the demand for better quality and safer foods. Food preferences determine where urban Chinese purchase their foods, whether it be at local &#8220;wet markets&#8221;, urban supermarkets, or restaurants. Chinese value the diversity in food products that different shopping outlets offer. In the future, analysts predict that further income growth and urbanization will continue to increase demand for a variety of higher quality foods, according to USITC.

&#160;

Like that of other countries at similar stages of development, the traditional Chinese diet comprises mostly grains and other starches. Consumption of non-staple, higher-value foods such as meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and processed food has grown significantly in the past three decades; 30 percent of the food currently consumed in China has been processed in some way, according to USITC.

&#160;

China&#8217;s per capita expenditures for animal proteins for 2008 averaged USD 184, up from USD 137 in the previous year. The Chinese consume about four times as much pork as poultry, the second most popular animal protein. Pork consumption has been encouraged by improved cold storage distribution, as the product can be transported greater distances to reach more customers. Pork consumption levels are also high due to government support programs, including purchasing pork for reserves and occasionally subsidizing pork purchases for low-income consumers.

The market for aquatic products and aquaculture in China 

The information in this section regarding aquatic and aquaculture, including graphs, is taken from the USDA&#8217;s GAIN Report Number: CH12073 per 12/28/2012 unless otherwise stated. 11 

&#160;

Total Aquatic Products Production 

China has the world&#8217;s largest aquatic production and its market share of the world&#8217;s fish production has risen from 7 percent in 1961 to 37 percent by 2012. China alone accounted for 62.3 percent of the aquaculture production in the world by volume in 2012. Aquaculture represents more than 70 percent of the total fish production in China. Total 2012 aquatic production in China increased 7.5 percent to reach 58.9 million tons, compared to the 54.8 million tons in 2011, according to the FAO. 12 

&#160;

Fish production accounts for 59 percent of the total aquatic production, followed by shellfish and crustaceans at 22.6 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Fish production is, according to the USDA, expected to continue its upward growth trend to reach 34.5 million tons in 2012, up from 33 million tons in 2011 and 31.3 million tons in 2010.

&#160;

&#160;

11 Definition of terms: China&#8217;s definition of aquatic products includes both cultured (farm-raised) and wild caught products; aquatic products include fish, shrimp/prawn/crab, shellfish, algae, and other. Aquatic catch production is total volume of both fresh and seawater wild caught aquatic products; Aquaculture production is the total volume of both fresh and seawater cultured (farmed) aquatic products. This report will use Chinese terminology to maintain consistency between Chinese statistics and product categories. Total aquatic trade statistics below do not include fishmeal.

12 Food Outlook, October 2014, FAO

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In 2011, Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces profited from favorable coastal locations and abundant freshwater resources/facilities to rank as the top four aquatic production areas. In terms of freshwater cultured production, Hubei, Guangdong, and Jiangsu provinces are the largest producers.

&#160;

Aquaculture 

China remains the world largest aquaculture producer with total cultured aquatic production accounting for about 70 percent of the world total in recent years. Total aquaculture production is increasing steadily and world aquaculture reached 90.4 million tons, with 66.6 million tons of food fish and 23.8 million tons of aquatic algae in 2012. Unconfirmed numbers state that world food fish aquaculture production rose 5.8 percent to 70.5 million tons in 2013. China alone accounted for 43.5 million tons of food fish and 13.5 of aquatic algae in 2013. China has had a CAGR of 5.5 percent in aquaculture production from the year 2000 through 2012.

&#160;

Total aquatic products in China amounted to 59.1 million tons, where seawater aquatic products represented 30.3 million tons or 51.34 percent and freshwater aquatic products amounted to 28,743,000 tons or 48.66 percent of the total production. Fish is the most produced product and accounts for almost 61 percent of the total production, followed by shrimp, prawn and crab and shellfish. The majority of the production is in the region Shandong, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. These five regions represented more than 55 percent of the total production of aquatic products in China. All regions are located nearby water and fish and other aquatic products is a common source of protein for the inhabitants in these regions. 13 

&#160;

Aquatic consumption 

As China&#8217;s processing and distribution systems become more developed and consumers rising affluence increases, their interest in a more diversified and nutritious diet, seafood consumption is on the increase. According to the National Statistics Bureau, the per capita consumption of aquatic products was 14.62 kg per urban dweller and 5.36 kg per rural inhabitant in 2011. Per capita consumption is expected to increase steadily, with strong growth potential in the rural sector.

&#160;

The per capita consumption of aquatic products is highest in coastal regions, for example in Shanghai and Guangdong, (where aquatic products have been a traditional source of protein) and locations with relatively high disposable income.

&#160;

According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China the overall price level of aquatic products increased 3.9 percent in July 2014 compared to the same month in 2013. 14 

&#160;

Exports and imports 

China is by far the largest exporter of aquatic products in the world, with total exports amounting to USD 19.6 billion in 2013 compared to Norway that is the second largest exporter in the world with exports amounting to USD 10.4 billion.

&#160;

China has now become the third largest importer of aquatic products, behind only the United States and Japan. Total import of aquatic products in 2013 amounted to USD 8.0 billion. The increase in the import levels in China is mainly a result of outsourcing. China&#8217;s processors import raw material from all major regions, including South and North America and Europe, for re-processing and re-export. However, this growth also reflects China&#8217;s surging domestic demand of species not available from local sources.

&#160;

Recirculating Aquaculture Systems 

Recirculating aquaculture systems (&#8220; RAS &#8221;) is a technology that enables the same water to be reused within the same tank, and operates through filtering this water, at a high frequency, making it an efficient and environmentally friendly method to operate water tanks. The advantages of RAS include improved productivity, lower labor requirements and lower mortality rate of the animals. Historically, the Chinese population are used to fresh aquatic products and prefer locally produced food if they can be assured of food quality and safety. Studies show that consumers overall are willing to pay an average premium of 3.9 percent for Closed Containment Aquaculture (&#8220; CCA &#8221;) compared to conventional farming methods such as sea water farming. 15 

&#160;

The market for meat in China 

China is by far the world&#8217;s largest producer and consumer of meat which includes pork, poultry and beef. Historically, this situation did not have a large impact on the rest of the world, as China, for the most part, maintained self-sufficiency in meat. However, since 2007 the situation has changed dramatically. China has gradually turned into a net importer of meats.

&#160;

World meat production was around 308.5 million tons in 2013. 16 China&#8217;s meat production reached 86.05 million tons in 2013. China&#8217;s total meat production was more than double of any other country in the world, where total meat production in the United States amounted to 42.80 million tons in 2013.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

With strong economic growth, China&#8217;s urbanization has occurred at a faster pace than commonly expected. By the end of 2011, the urban population for the first time exceeded the rural population, reaching 51.3 percent of the total population. If rural migrants working in urban areas are included, the population working and living in urban areas accounted for about 70 percent of the total population. Urbanization and rising purchasing power has led to a dietary pattern change switching from the consumption of traditional food grain products to an increase in consumption of meat. 17 The change in consumer preferences, meaning higher priced red meat representing a major part of Chinese consumers main protein source, partly derives from the perception that consumption of red meat is equal to higher status than consumption of poultry or pork. 18 

&#160;

There are several other specific market drivers which underpin the increase in demand for red meat. One driver is the improved living standard in China which stimulates the growth of beef markets since beef often sells at a much higher price and traditionally has been more expensive than what most people can afford. Another is the fact that Chinese people&#8217;s dietary structure is becoming more diversified and reasonable, bringing larger amount of beef consumption since beef has nutritional benefits. Lastly, a gradual lowering of import taxes is likely to support sufficient supply of cattle.

&#160;

The strong rise in feed grain prices in the past five years is now moving substantially through the market chain and is being reflected in higher meat prices with the exception of poultry where adjustments have been made. On the contrary, world meat consumption continues to grow at one of the highest rates among major agricultural commodities. Thus, developing countries can expect an increase in meat imports despite strong meat prices, driven by population and income growth with high elasticity of demand. Equally so, strong prices will result in sustained export earnings, which will encourage large meat exporting countries to invest in international meat markets. When breaking the expected increase of demand down by region it is evident that the Asia and Pacific region is projected to stand for the largest increase in demand by far. 19 

&#160;

Market drivers 

&#160; 

The improvement of living standard stimulates the growth of beef markets:

Traditionally, Chinese people eat pork and chicken to satisfy their desire for meat. This is largely due to the much higher price of beef which goes beyond normal people&#8217;s affordable level. With the improvement of living standards, Chinese people have begun the upgrade of their consumption of meat, and began to eat more beef.

&#160; 

Chinese people&#8217;s dietary structure becomes more diversified and reasonable, bringing larger amount of beef consumption:

At present, Chinese people are changing their diet patterns to higher and richer nutrition. From a nutritional perspective, beef not only contains high unsaturated fatty acids and high protein, it also has low fat and lots of nutrition, which makes it perfect for the healthy diet. Thus, in the future, beef is expected to replace some parts of the market shares in pork, chicken and other meats. 20 

&#160;

The market for fertilizer in China 

Sales of fertilizers are expected to be supported by healthy expansion of agricultural activities as the amount of sown areas continues to grow and rural income levels rise. Farmers will continue to register steadily increasing incomes, the result of growing crop prices and government subsidies designed to supplement their revenues and reduce their material costs. Subsidies aimed directly at cutting the cost of fertilizers is expected to encourage additional use. In addition, rising crop prices have encouraged farmers to invest in fertilizers to further boost crop yields. Advances will also be driven by increases in the acreage of sown land dedicated to growing cash crops. However, increasing demand for organic food and improved understanding of the correct application of fertilizers is expected to prevent demand from rising at a faster pace.

&#160;

In value terms, fertilizer demand is expected to grow 6.0 percent per year to RMB 548 billion, outpacing gains in volume terms. Faster value growth will be driven by strong demand for higher value multi-nutrient fertilizers. In addition, advances will be supported by continued growth in fertilizer prices as the cost of natural gas, oil, coal, and other raw materials continues to increase.

&#160;

Demand for fertilizer nutrients in China is projected to grow 4.4 percent annually through 2015 to 98.1 million metric tons. Nutrient demand will be stimulated by increasing use of higher nutrient level products as income levels grow in rural areas in China. In addition, government efforts to promote multi-nutrient fertilizers will also support gains in fertilizer nutrient demand. Accounting for more than three-fourths of total fertilizer demand in 2010, single-nutrient fertilizers will remain the larger product type through 2015, despite a relatively low growth rate of 2.1 percent per year. Sales of single nutrient fertilizers will continue to be supported by their relatively low prices.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The size, growth and composition of fertilizer demand in the six regions that make up China vary considerably. The Central-South and Central-East will remain the two largest regional fertilizer markets. Due to the comparatively high income levels in the Central-South and Central-East - which enable residents to afford more expensive food items - demand for cash crops such as fruits and vegetables will rise in these regions, which in turn will fuel demand for fertilizer. Sales in the Northeast and Northwest regions will outpace the average through 2015, benefiting from the Great Western Development Strategy, the Northeast Revitalization Policy, and increasing income levels for farmers. 21 

&#160;

In 2006, the central government started a program intended to partially compensate farmers for price increases in fuel, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs. In the case of fertilizers, government support is part of several separate programs targeting fertilizer producers, with cost reductions being passed along to farmers purchasing the input. By 2009, fuel and fertilizer subsidies totaled USD 10.5 billion. 22

Market for fruits and vegetables in China 

The information in this section regarding the market for fruit in China is taken from the International Trade Center report &#8220;Overview of the markets for selected tropical fruits and vegetables in China&#8221; unless otherwise stated.

&#160;

China is the biggest producer of fruit in the world, with a total of approximately 10,734,259 hectares of fruit planting area and a fruit output of approximately 192,202,000 tons as of 2008, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of the PRC. The per capita annual fruit consumption in China as of 2008 amounted 149 kilograms per capita, well above the global average of 69.09 kilograms per capita, according to FAO. In 2009, China exported 5,255,000 tons of fruit, an 8.5 percent year-on-year increase compared to the previous year, equivalent to a value USD 3.83 billion according to China Customs. The Chinese import of fruit in 2009 amounted to 2,309,000 tons, valued to USD 1.63 billion, a 37.0 percent increase year-on-year compared to 2008. This led to a fruit trade surplus of USD 2.2 billion, approximately a 27.6 percent decrease compared to 2008 according the Ministry of Agriculture of the PRC.

&#160;

The global tropical fruit output, where the dragon fruit (Hylocereus Undatus) is included, reached roughly 82,700,000 tons in 2008 according to FAO. The output was led by mango, followed by pineapple, guava and avocado. According to the Ministry of Agriculture of the PRC, tropical fruit accounted for approximately 25 percent of the total fruit planting area in China in 2009, equivalent to roughly 2,500,000 hectares providing a total output of more than 20,000,000 tons. The research adds that an additional 17,500,000 hectares spread over China is suitable for planting tropical fruits.

&#160;

The most commonly consumed tropical fruits in China are pineapple, mango, banana, litchi, coconut, longan and cashew. However demand for, e.g., mangosteen, star fruit, durian and dragon fruit is quickly growing among the population in the first and second tier cities. The China Fruit Marketing Association estimates that the consumption of tropical fruits accounts for roughly 10 percent of all the fruit in China, equivalent to approximately 19,000,000 tons. Analysts estimate that about 80 percent of the tropical fruit in China is consumed fresh, contrary to canned or processed fruit.

&#160;

Consumer trends 

Consumers in the northern and central parts of China generally prefer more sweet tasting fruit, preferably tropical fruits. In the southern regions of China however, the population consumes a broader range of fruits. Overall in China, consumers have started to consume more fruit with distinctive smells, for example durian and jackfruit. During recent years there has been a significant increase in consumption of more expensive fruit, such as durian, mangosteen and jackfruit thanks to the increasing standard of living of the population as well as the increased availability of such imported fruits.

&#160;

The most commonly consumed imported fruits in China include kiwi, durian, mangosteen, grapes, cherries and dragon fruit. Generally, the Chinese population prefers to consume fresh fruit; so when domestic, fresh fruit is available during summer, consumption of the fresher and cheaper domestic fruit increases. In winter, when domestic products cannot be harvested or sold, the import of fruits, and especially tropical fruits, increases immensely.

&#160;

Organic fruits are mostly sold domestically in China and have become increasingly popular in the market; however, the supply is still relatively small and the price is still more expensive (approximately RMB 1-2 more expensive per kg).

&#160;

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

Regulation of M&#38;A and Overseas Listings 

On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce (the &#8220; MOFCOM &#8221;), the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation (&#8220; SAT &#8221;), the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (the &#8220; SAIC &#8221;), the China Securities Regulatory Commission (&#8220; CSRC &#8221;), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the &#8220; SAFE &#8221;), jointly issued the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors &#160;(the &#8220; M&#38;A Rule &#8221;), which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended on June 22, 2009. The M&#38;A Rule includes provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for purposes of the overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle&#8217;s securities on an overseas stock exchange.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official Website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with the CSRC. The application of this new PRC regulation remains unclear, with no consensus currently existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope of the applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.

&#160;

The M&#38;A Rules also establish procedures and requirements that could make some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a Chinese domestic enterprise.

&#160;

In February 2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors &#160;(&#8220; Circular 6 &#8221;), which established a security review system for mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Under Circular 6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having &#8220;national defense and security&#8221; concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign investors may acquire &#8220;de facto control&#8221; of domestic enterprises with &#8220;national security&#8221; concerns. In August 2011, the MOFCOM promulgated the Rules on Implementation of Security Review System &#160;(the &#8220; MOFCOM Security Review Rules &#8221;), to replace the Interim Provisions of the Ministry of Commerce on Matters Relating to the Implementation of the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors promulgated by the MOFCOM in March 2011. The MOFCOM Security Review Rules, which came into effect on September 1, 2011, provide that the MOFCOM will look into the substance and actual impact of a transaction and prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through proxies, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions.

&#160;

Regulation of Foreign Currency Exchange and Dividend Distribution 

The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations (the &#8220; FX Regulations &#8221;), which were last amended in August 2008. Under the FX Regulations, the RMB is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the SAFE is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made. On August 29, 2008, the SAFE issued a notice, Circular 142 , regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Circular 142 requires that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, the SAFE increased its oversight of the flow and use of the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without the SAFE&#8217;s approval, and may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 142 will result in severe penalties, such as heavy fines. As a result, Circular 142 may significantly limit our ability to transfer cash or other assets from Sino Agro Food, Inc. and/or our other non-PRC subsidiaries into our subsidiaries in the PRC, which may adversely affect our business expansion and we may not be able to convert the net proceeds into RMB to invest in or acquire any other PRC companies, or establish other variable interest entities (&#8220; VIEs &#8221;) in the PRC.

&#160;

Dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its overseas shareholder are deemed income of the shareholder and are taxable in the PRC. Pursuant to the Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996) , foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may purchase or remit foreign currency, subject to a cap approved by the SAFE, for settlement of current account transactions without the approval of the SAFE. Foreign currency transactions under the capital account are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, the SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities.

&#160;

In October 2005, the SAFE promulgated the Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents&#8217; Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles &#160;(&#8220; Circular 75 &#8221;). Under Circular 75, which was issued by SAFE effective November 1, 2005, prior registration with the local SAFE branch is required for PRC residents to establish or to control an offshore company for the purposes of financing that offshore company with assets or equity interests in an onshore enterprise located in the PRC. An amendment to the registration or filing with the local SAFE branch by such PRC resident is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise in the offshore company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company, or any other material change involving a change in the capital of the offshore company. Moreover, Circular 75 applies retroactively. As a result, PRC residents who, prior to November 1, 2005, had established or acquired control of offshore companies that had made onshore investments in the PRC prior to were required to complete the relevant registration procedures with the local SAFE branch by March 31, 2006.

&#160;

Since May 2007, the SAFE has issued a series of guidance to its local branches with respect to the operational process for the SAFE registration under Circular 75. The guidance provides more specific and stringent supervision of the registration required by Circular 75. For example, the guidance imposes obligations on onshore subsidiaries of an offshore entity to make true and accurate statements to the local SAFE authorities regarding any shareholder or beneficial owner of the offshore entity who is a PRC citizen or resident. Untrue statements by the onshore subsidiaries will lead to potential liability for the subsidiaries and, in some instances, for their legal representatives and other related individuals.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Under the relevant rules, failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including increases in its registered capital, payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and capital inflows from the offshore entity, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. PRC residents who control our company from time to time are required to register with the SAFE in connection with their investments in us.

&#160;

On December 25, 2006, the People&#8217;s Bank of China (the &#8220; PBOC &#8221;) issued the Administration Measures on Individual Foreign Exchange Control and related Implementation Rules were issued by the SAFE on January 5, 2007. Both became effective on February 1, 2007. Under these regulations, all foreign exchange transactions involving an employee share incentive plan, share option plan, or similar plan participated in by onshore individuals may be conducted only with approval from the SAFE or its authorized branch. Under the Notice of Issues Related to the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Listed Company &#160;(&#8220; Offshore Share Incentives Rules &#8221;), which was issued by the SAFE on February 15, 2012, PRC citizens who are granted share options, restricted share units or restricted shares by an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with the SAFE or its authorized branch and to comply with a series of other requirements. If we, or the PRC employees of ours who hold options, restricted share units or restricted shares fail to comply with these registration or other procedural requirements, we, and/or such employees may be subject to fines and other legal sanctions.

&#160;

The principal regulations governing distribution of dividends of foreign holding companies include the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law &#160;(1986), which was amended in October 2000, and the Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law &#160;(2001). Under these regulations, foreign investment enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign investment enterprises in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.

&#160; 

Laws and Regulations Related to Employment and Labor Protection 

On June 29, 2007, the National People&#8217;s Congress promulgated the Employment Contract Law of PRC &#160;(&#8220; Employment Contract Law &#8221;), which became effective as of January 1, 2008 and was amended on December 28, 2012. The Employment Contract Law requires employers to provide written contracts to their employees, restricts the use of temporary workers and aims to give employees long-term job security.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Employment Contract Law, employment contracts lawfully concluded prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law and continuing as of the date of its implementation shall continue to be performed. Where an employment relationship was established prior to the implementation of the Employment Contract Law but no written employment contract was concluded, a contract must be concluded within one month after its implementation.

&#160;

On September 18, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Implementing Regulations for the PRC Employment Contract Law which came into effect immediately. These regulations interpret and supplement the provisions of the Employment Contract Law . 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had entered into written employment contracts with three of our employees.

&#160; 

Income Tax 

On March 16, 2007, the National People&#8217;s Congress approved and promulgated the Enterprise Income Tax Law (the &#8220; EIT Law &#8221;). On December 6, 2007, the State Council approved the Implementing Rules. Both the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law and the Implementing Rules, which superseded the previous Income Tax Law, the enterprise income tax rate for both domestic companies and foreign invested enterprises is unified at 25%. On December 26, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Circular on Implementation of Enterprise Tax Transition Preferential Policy, or the Preferential Policy Circular. The EIT Law, its Implementing Rules and the Preferential Policy Circular provide a five-year transitional period for certain entities that had enjoyed a favorable income tax rate of less than 25% under the previous Income Tax Law and were established before March 16, 2007, during which period the applicable enterprises income tax rate shall gradually increase to 25%.

&#160;

On April 14, 2008, the Administration Measures for Recognition of High and New Technology Enterprises, or the Recognition Measures, were jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Finance, and the SAT, which sets out the standards and process for granting the high and new technology enterprises status. According to the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules as well as the Recognition Measures, enterprises which have been granted the high and new technology enterprises status shall enjoy a favorable income tax rate of 15%. The new EIT Law and its Implementation Rules also provide that &#8220;software enterprises&#8221; enjoy a two-year income tax exemption starting from the first profit making year, followed by a reduced tax rate of 12.5% for the subsequent three years.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The EIT Law also provides that an enterprise established under the laws of a foreign country or region but whose &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; is located in the PRC be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and consequently be subject to the PRC income tax at the rate of 25% for its global income. The Implementing Rules merely defines the location of the &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; as &#8220;the place where the exercising, in substance, of the overall management and control of the production and business operation, personnel, accounting, properties, etc., of a non-PRC company is located.&#8221; The SAT issued the Circular regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. Circular 82 provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise is located in China. The SAT issued the Bulletin regarding the Administrative Measures on the Income Tax of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises (Interim) on July 27, 2011, which became effective on September 1, 2011, providing more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82. This bulletin clarifies matters including resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. Although both Circular 82 and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises, not companies like us, the determining criteria set forth in Circular 82 and the bulletin may reflect the SAT&#8217;s general position on how the &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals. Based on a review of surrounding facts and circumstances, the Company does not believe that it is likely that its operations outside of the PRC should be considered a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. However, due to limited guidance and implementation history of the EIT Law, should the Company be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, the Company will be subject to PRC tax on worldwide income at a uniform tax rate of 25% retroactive to January 1, 2008.

&#160;

The EIT Law also imposes a withholding income tax of 10% on dividends distributed by a Foreign Invested Enterprise (an &#8220; FIE &#8221;) to its immediate holding company outside of China if such immediate holding company is considered a non-resident enterprise without any establishment or place within China or if the received dividends have no connection with the establishment or place of such immediate holding company within China, unless such immediate holding company&#8217;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Such withholding income tax was exempted under the previous law. The State of Nevada, where the Company is incorporated, does not have such tax treaty with China. The SAT further promulgated a circular, or Circular 601, on October 27, 2009, which provides that the tax treaty benefits will be denied to &#8220;conduit&#8221; or shell companies without business substance and that a beneficial ownership analysis will be used based on a &#8220;substance-over-form&#8221; principle to determine whether or not to grant the tax treaty benefits. A majority of our subsidiaries in China are directly held by our non-Chinese subsidiaries. If we are regarded as a non-resident enterprise and our non-Chinese subsidiaries are regarded as resident enterprises, then our non-Chinese subsidiaries may be required to pay a 10% withholding tax on any dividends payable to us. If our non-Chinese subsidiaries are regarded as non-resident enterprises, then our PRC subsidiaries may be required to pay a 5% withholding tax for any dividends payable to our non-Chinese subsidiaries, however, it is still unclear at this stage whether Circular 601 applies to dividends from our PRC subsidiaries paid to our non-Chinese subsidiaries, and if our non-Chinese subsidiaries were not considered as &#8220;beneficial owners&#8221; of any dividends from their PRC subsidiaries, whether the dividends payable to our non-Chinese subsidiaries would be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%.

&#160;

The EIT Law and its Implementation Rules have made an effort to scrutinize transactions between related parties. Pursuant to the EIT Law and its Implementation Rules, the tax authorities may impose mandatory adjustment on tax due to the extent a related party transaction is not in line with arm&#8217;s-length principle or was entered into with a purpose to reduce, avoid or delay the payment of tax. On January 8, 2009, the SAT issued the Implementation Measures for Special Tax Adjustments (Trial), which clarifies the definition of &#8220;related party&#8221; and sets forth the tax-filing disclosure and documentation requirements, the selection and application of transfer pricing methods, and transfer pricing investigation and assessment procedures.

&#160;

On December 10, 2009, the SAT issued a circular on Strengthening the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax Collection on Income Derived from Equity Transfer by Non-resident Enterprise, or Circular 698. Pursuant to Circular 698, non-resident enterprises should declare any direct transfer of equity interest of PRC resident enterprises and pay taxes in accordance with the EIT Law and relevant laws and regulations. For an indirect transfer, if the effective tax rate for the transferor (a non-PRC-resident enterprise) is lower than 12.5% under the law of the jurisdiction of the direct transferred target, the transferor is required to submit relevant transaction materials to PRC tax authorities for review. If such indirect transfer is determined by PRC tax authorities to be a transaction without any reasonable business purpose other than for the purpose of tax avoidance, the gains derived from such transfer will be subject to PRC income tax.

&#160;

In addition to the above, after the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules were promulgated, the SAT released several regulations to stipulate more details for carrying out the EIT Law and its Implementing Rules. These regulations include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on the Issues Concerning the Administration of Enterprise Income Tax Deduction and Exemption (2008); &#160;
