School, Home and Office 

Westcott 

Westcott, with a history of quality dating back to 1872, provides innovative cutting and measuring products for the school, home and office. Principal products under the Westcott brand include scissors, rulers, pencil sharpeners, paper trimmers, lettering products and math tools.

&#160;

Many of the Westcott branded cutting products contain patented titanium bonding and proprietary non-stick coatings, making the blades more than three times harder than stainless steel as well as reducing friction and corrosion. Significant product introductions in 2013 included the iPoint USB powered pencil sharpener and the X-Ray series of scissors. Westcott earned additional awards during the 2014 back-to-school season in both the school and office markets. Both the iPoint Evolution Axis heavy-duty electric sharpener and the Westcott antimicrobial classroom scissor caddy have been awarded Learning&#174; Magazine&#8217;s Teachers&#8217; Choice Awards for 2014-2015. Significant product introductions in 2015 included a Carbo titanium line of scissors which are 8x harder than steel allowing the blades to stay shaper longer.

The Company acquired the brand in 2007 and re-launched it in 2009 with an updated and innovative line of fixed blade and folding knives. Many of the knives are enhanced with Titanium Carbonitride coatings to increase the hardness of the blade of up to 10 times that of stainless steel.

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The Company owns many patents and trademarks that are important to its business. The Company&#8217;s success depends in part on its ability to maintain patent protection for its products, to preserve its proprietary technology and to operate without infringing upon the patents or proprietary rights of others. The Company generally files patent applications in the United States and foreign countries where patent protection for its technology is appropriate and available. The Company also considers its trademarks important to the success of its business. The more significant trademarks include Westcott, Clauss, Camillus, PhysiciansCare, First Aid Only, Cuda and Pac-Kit. Patents and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The weighted average amortization period remaining for intangible assets at December 31, 2015 was 8 years.

&#160; 

Product Distribution; Major Customers 

&#160;

Independent manufacturer representatives and direct sales are primarily used to sell the Company&#8217;s line of consumer products to wholesale, contract and retail stationery distributors, office supply super stores, school supply distributors, industrial distributors, wholesale florists, mass market retailers and hardware chains (including through their websites). The Company also sells a limited selection of its products directly to consumers through its own websites. In 2015 and 2014, the Company had two customers, respectively that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales. Net sales to these customers amounted to approximately 12% each in 2015 and approximately 14% and 12% in 2014.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company competes with many companies in each market and geographic area. The Company believes that the principal points of competition in these markets are product innovation, quality, price, merchandising, design and engineering capabilities, product development, timeliness and completeness of delivery, conformity to customer specifications and post-sale support. The major competitors in the cutting category are 3M and Fiskars Corporation. The major competitors in the measuring category are Maped and Staedtler. The major competitor in the pencil sharpener category is Bostitch. The major competitors in the first aid &#38; safety category are Honeywell, 3M and Johnson &#38; Johnson.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Traditionally, the Company&#8217;s sales are stronger in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year due to the seasonal nature of the back-to-school business.

&#160;

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

&#160;

The Company believes that it is in compliance with applicable environmental laws. The Company anticipates that no material adverse financial impact will result from compliance with current environmental rules and regulations. In December 2008, the Company sold property it owned in Bridgeport, CT. Under the terms of the sales agreement, the Company was responsible for environmental remediation on the property in accordance with the Connecticut Transfer Act. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company received notice from the Connecticut Department of Energy &#38; Environmental Protection that it had accepted and approved the Company&#8217;s filing of its Form III Verification Report. As a result, the Company&#8217;s remediation and monitoring obligations have been satisfied.

&#160;

On April 7, 2014, the Company sold its Fremont, NC distribution facility for $850,000 in cash. Under the terms of the sales agreement, the Company is responsible for environmental remediation on the property. As a result of studies and estimates prepared by an independent environmental consulting firm, and in conjunction with the sale of the property, the Company recorded a liability of $300,000 in the second quarter of 2014, related to the remediation of the property. The accrual included the total estimated costs of remedial activities and post-remediation operating and maintenance costs. Remediation work on the Fremont project began in the third quarter of 2014 and was completed in 2015. In addition to the remediation work, the Company, with the assistance of its independent environmental consulting firm, must continue to monitor contaminant levels on the property to ensure they comply with governmental standards. The Company expects that the monitoring period will last a period of five years after the completion of the remediation and be complete by the end of 2020.

&#160;

See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information regarding the cost of remediation and related matters, including ongoing monitoring of contaminant levels.

&#160;
