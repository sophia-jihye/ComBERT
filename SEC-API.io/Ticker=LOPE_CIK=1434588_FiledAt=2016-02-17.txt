 Item 1. Business Overview 

We are a comprehensive regionally accredited university that offers approximately 200 graduate and undergraduate degree programs and certificates across eight colleges both online and on ground at our 200+ acre campus in Phoenix, Arizona, at leased facilities and at facilities owned by third party employers of our students. We are committed to providing an academically rigorous educational experience with a focus on professionally relevant programs that meet the objectives of our students. Our undergraduate programs are designed to be innovative and meet the future needs of employers, while providing students with the needed critical thinking and effective communication skills developed through a Christian-oriented, liberal arts foundation. We offer master and doctoral degrees in contemporary fields that are designed to provide students with the capacity for transformational leadership in their chosen industry, emphasizing the immediate relevance of theory, application, and evaluation to promote personal and organizational change. We utilize an integrated, innovative approach to marketing, recruiting, and retaining both traditional aged students attending on our campus in Phoenix, Arizona and working adult students attending on our campus or at off-site locations in cohorts (referred to by us as professional studies students) or online, which has enabled us to increase enrollment to approximately 74,500 students at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, 79.6% of our students were enrolled in our online programs, and, of our working adult students (online and professional studies students), 47.8% were pursuing masters or doctoral degrees. 

We define working adults as students age 25 or older who are pursuing a degree while employed. As of December 31, 2015, 87.1% of our online and professional studies students were age 25 or older. We believe that working adults are attracted to the convenience and flexibility of our online programs because they can study and interact with faculty and classmates during times that suit their schedules. We also believe that working adults, particularly those who have some college experience, represent an attractive student population because they are better able to more readily recognize the benefits of a postsecondary degree, have higher persistence and completion rates than other students, and to finance their education generally. 

In 2015, we continued to increase the number of students in attendance at our expanding traditional ground campus. We attribute the significant growth in our enrollment to our increasing brand recognition and the value proposition that our ground traditional campus affords to traditional-aged students and their parents. After scholarships, our ground traditional students pay for tuition, room, board, and fees, often half to a third of what it costs to attend a private, traditional university in another state and an amount comparable to what it costs to attend a public university. We plan to increase enrollment growth for our traditional campus over the next few years, and seek to have 17,500 traditional ground students in attendance at the beginning of our 2016-2017 academic year. In November 2012, we accepted an invitation to become a member of the Division I Western Athletic Conference beginning with the 2013-2014 academic year, and in 2013 we began the four-year process to reclassify our NCAA membership from Division II to Division I. During the reclassification process we are considered a Division I university and are playing full conference schedules but are ineligible to compete for national championships which, for example, precludes us from playing in the end-of-year NCAA basketball tournament during that period of time. 

We have experienced significant growth in enrollment, net revenue, and operating income over the last several years. Our enrollment at December 31, 2015 was approximately 74,500, representing an increase of approximately 9.9% over our enrollment at December 31, 2014. Our net revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $778.2 million and $210.4 million, respectively, representing increases of 12.6% and 16.3%, respectively, over the year ended December 31, 2014. Our net revenue and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $691.1 million and $180.8 million, respectively, representing increases of 15.5% and 26.2%, respectively, over the year ended December 31, 2013. We seek to achieve continued growth in a manner that reinforces our reputation for providing academically rigorous, professionally relevant educational programs that advance the educations and careers of our students. 

We have been regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and its predecessor since 1968, and we were reaccredited in 2007 for the maximum term of ten years. We are regulated by the Department of Education as a result of our participation in the federal student financial aid programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act (hereafter, Title IV), and, at the state level, we are licensed to operate and offer our programs by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education (AZPPSE), the Arizona Department of Education (ADE) and Arizona State Board of Education for Institutional Recommendation Programs and the Arizona Board of Nursing. In addition, we have specialized accreditations for certain programs from the National Addiction Studies Accreditation Commission (NASAC), the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), and the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE). In addition, we are a candidate for accreditation by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). We believe that our institution-wide state authorization and regional accreditation, together with these specialized accreditations, reflect the quality of our programs, enhance their marketability to students, and improve the employability of our graduates. 

&#160;

History 

Grand Canyon College was founded in Prescott, Arizona in 1949 as a traditional, private, non-profit college and moved to its existing campus in Phoenix, Arizona in 1951. Established as a Baptist-affiliated institution with a strong emphasis on religious studies, the school initially focused on offering bachelor&#146;s degree programs in education. Over the years, the school expanded its curricula to include programs in the sciences, nursing, business, music, and arts. The college obtained regional accreditation in 1968 from the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education, North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, the predecessor to the Higher Learning Commission, and began offering nursing programs and master&#146;s degree programs in education and business in the 1980s. In 1989, it achieved university status and became Grand Canyon University. The university introduced its first distance learning programs in 1997, and launched its first online programs in 2003 in business and education. In early 2000, it discontinued its Baptist affiliation and became an interdenominational Christian university. 

In late 2003, the school&#146;s Board of Trustees initiated a process to evaluate alternatives as a result of the school&#146;s poor financial condition and, in February 2004, a group of investors acquired the assets of the school and converted the school into a for-profit institution. 

Our Approach to Academic Quality 

Some of the key elements that we focus on to promote a high level of academic quality include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Academically rigorous, professionally relevant curricula. We prepare learners to become global citizens, critical thinkers, effective communicators and responsible leaders by providing an academically challenging, values-based curriculum from the context of our Christian heritage. We create academically rigorous curricula that are designed to enable all students to gain the foundational knowledge, professional competencies, and demonstrable skills required to be successful in their chosen fields. Our curriculum is designed and delivered by faculty and industry-specific subject-matter experts who are committed to high quality, rigorous education and professional preparedness. We design our curricula to address specific objectives that pre-career and working-adult students need and are seeking. Through this combination, we believe that we produce graduates that can compete with integrity and become leaders in their chosen fields. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Qualified faculty. We demonstrate our commitment to high quality education by hiring qualified faculty with relevant practical experience. Substantially all of our current faculty members hold at least a master&#146;s degree in their respective fields and approximately 46% of our faculty members of record are doctorate prepared. Further, the University has implemented a full time faculty model for online course instruction. In 2015, almost all of the online first year courses were taught by an online, full time faculty member. We believe the presence of a full time faculty member in the classroom for the first year students results in increased student retention. We invest in the professional development of our faculty members by providing online and ground pedagogical training along with hosting events that encourage the development and sharing of best practices. Additionally, we also monitor and evaluate teaching effectiveness through assessment content reviews, peer reviews, and student evaluations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Centralized program design and curriculum development. We employ a college driven highly collaboratively designed curriculum development process to ensure a consistent learning experience. We continuously review our programs at least every 3 years in an effort to ensure that they remain consistent, up-to-date, relevant, and effective in producing the desired learning outcomes. We also annually review programmatic assessment results, mission based competency results, graduation rates, retention rates and constituency surveys to identify opportunities for course modifications and upgrades. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Effective student services. We establish teams comprised of admissions and student services advisor personnel that act as the primary support contact point for each of our students, beginning at the application stage and continuing through graduation. We also continually focus on improving the technology used to support student learning, including delivering a new online learning platform and further improving student services through the implementation of online interfaces. As a result, many of our support services, including academic, administrative, financial, library, and career services, are accessible online, generally allowing users to access these services at a time and in a manner that is convenient to them. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continual academic oversight. We have centralized the support functions of assessment for all of our programs through our Office of Assessment. While each of our colleges continuously evaluates the desired learning outcomes for each of their programs, the Office of Assessment provides data collection and analysis support. We continuously assess outcomes data to determine whether our students graduate with the knowledge, competencies, and skills that are necessary to succeed in the workplace. The Office of Assessment also initiates and manages periodic examinations of the mission-based competencies in our curricula by full-time and adjunct reviewers to evaluate and verify mission-based competency attainment. Based on these processes and student feedback from both programmatic and mission-based assessment, we determine whether to modify or discontinue programs that do not meet our standards or market needs, or to create new programs. &#160;

We also offer the following features in an effort to enrich the academic experience of current and prospective students: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Flexibility in program delivery. We seek to meet market demands by providing students with the flexibility to take courses exclusively online or to combine online coursework with various campus and onsite options. For example, based on market demand, particularly in connection with our nursing programs, we have established satellite locations at multiple hospitals that allow nursing students to take clinical courses onsite while completing other course work online. We have established similar onsite arrangements with other major employers, including schools and school districts through which students can pursue student teaching opportunities. This flexibility raises our profile among employers, encourages students to take and complete courses, and eliminates inconveniences that tend to lessen student persistence. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Small class size. At December 31, 2015, 93.4% of our online and professional studies classes had 25 or fewer students. Our average, class size on our ground traditional campus is 25 students. These class sizes provide each student with the opportunity to interact directly with course faculty and to receive individualized feedback and attention while also affording our faculty with the opportunity to engage proactively with a manageable number of students. We believe this interaction enhances the academic quality of our programs by promoting opportunities for students to participate actively and thus build the requisite knowledge, competencies, and skills. Accreditation and Program Approvals 

We believe that the quality of our academic programs is evidenced by our university, college-, and program-specific accreditations and approvals. Grand Canyon University has been continuously accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and its predecessor since 1968, most recently obtaining reaccreditation in 2007 for the ten-year period through 2017. We are licensed in Arizona by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education. In addition, we have obtained the following specialized accreditations and approvals for our core program offerings:

Curricula 

We offer the degrees of Doctor of Education, Doctor of Business Administration, Doctor of Nursing Practice, Doctor of Philosophy, Education Specialist, Master of Divinity, Master of Arts, Master of Education, Master of Business Administration and Master of Public Administration, Master of Public Health, Master of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science and a variety of programs leading to each of these degrees. Many of our degree programs also offer a selection of emphases. We also offer certificate programs, which consist of a series of courses focused on a particular area of study, for both the post-baccalaureate and post-graduate students who seek to enhance their skills and knowledge or achieve additional licensure. 

We offer approximately 200 graduate and undergraduate degree programs and certificates through our eight distinct colleges: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the College of Nursing and Health Care Professions, which, as a result of, among other things, the strong pass rates of our Bachelor of Science in Nursing (pre-licensure) students on the National Council Licensure Examination (&#147;NCLEX&#148;), has a strong reputation within the Arizona nursing community and is the largest nursing program in Arizona when considering total college enrollment (bachelor and masters students); &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the College of Doctoral Studies, which utilizes innovative technology, collaboration, and learning communities to develop expert practitioners and researchers who can become leaders in the disciplines and communities they serve; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, which develops and provides many of the general education course requirements in our other colleges and also serves as one of the vehicles through which we offer programs in additional targeted disciplines; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the College of Science, Engineering, and Technology, which with science, engineering, technology, and mathematics professions in extremely high demand, driving our economy, continuously evolving, and redefining modern day life is focused on preparing exceptionally competent graduates to enter the dynamic and highly competitive workforce of the 21 st century; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the College of Education, which has greater than a 60-year history as one of Arizona&#146;s leading teacher&#146;s colleges and consistently graduates teachers who meet or exceed state averages on the Arizona Educator Proficiency Assessment exams; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the Colangelo College of Business, which has a well-known brand among our target student population, an advisory board that includes nationally recognized business leaders, and a reputation for offering professionally relevant degree programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the College of Fine Arts and Production, which continues the long and highly regarded tradition that the University has in the Fine Arts; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the College of Theology, which serves as one of the many vehicles through which the University affirms its Christian heritage. &#160;

Under the overall leadership of our senior academic affairs personnel and the deans of the individual colleges, each of the colleges organizes its academic programs through various departments and schools. 

We have established relationships with community colleges, health-care systems, school districts, and other employers through which we offer programs to provide flexibility and convenience to students and their employers. For example, for our nursing programs, we offer clinical courses onsite at hospitals and other health-care centers with which we have partnerships, and also arrange to allow these students to complete their clinical work onsite. 

We currently offer our ground-based programs to traditional students through three 15-week semesters in a calendar year and to online students in five, seven, eight or sixteen week courses throughout the calendar year. Traditional students generally enroll in three or four courses per semester while online students typically concentrate on one course at a time. We require our online students to be actively engaged in their online student classroom at least three or four times each week, depending on the content and degree level of the class, in order to maintain an active dialogue with their professors and classmates. Our online programs provide a digital record of student interactions for the course instructor to assess students&#146; levels of engagement and demonstration of required competencies. 

New Program Development 

To aid us in the identification of potentially new degree programs or emphasis areas, we investigate market demand and review proposals developed by faculty, staff, students, alumni, college specific advisory boards comprised of leaders in their field or other partners. We then perform an analysis of the consistency of the proposed program or emphasis with our mission, long-term demand, and development costs. If, following this analysis, the University Development Committee decides to proceed with a new program, our college faculty and administrators approve subject-matter experts with whom our Curriculum Design and Development Team members, including instructional designers, curriculum developers, librarians, and editors, work to design the program competencies so that it is consistent with our academically rigorous, professionally oriented program standards. The program is then reviewed by the dean of the applicable college, the Program Standards and Evaluation Faculty Committee, the Academic Affairs Committee, and finally, our Provost and Chief Academic Officer. Upon accreditation and regulatory approval, the subject matter experts develop course syllabi, and our Marketing Department creates a marketing plan to publicize the new program. Our average program development process is six months from proposal to course introduction. The development process is typically longer if we are expanding into a new field or offering a new level of degree. 

Assessment 

Our Office of Assessment serves as our central resource for measuring learning outcomes and student satisfaction and driving systematically engineered and data-driven continuous-improvement cycles for updating our curricula. Among other things, the assessment team reviews student course satisfaction surveys; analyzes archived student assignments to assess whether a given program is developing students&#146; foundational knowledge, professional competencies, and college skills to achieve the expected learning outcomes; and provides feedback as to program effectiveness. Based on this data and the conclusions of the assessment team, we modify programs as necessary to meet our student satisfaction and educational development standards. 

Faculty 

Our faculty includes full-time faculty, as well as adjunct faculty with relevant practical experience whom we employ to teach on a course-by-course basis for a specified fee. Our current faculty members hold at least a master&#146;s degree in their respective fields and approximately 46% of our teaching faculty of record hold doctorate degrees. 

We believe that the quality of our faculty is critical to our success, particularly because faculty members have more interaction with our students than any other university employee. Accordingly, we regularly review the performance of our faculty, including, but not limited to, engaging our full-time faculty and other specialists to conduct peer reviews of our adjunct faculty, monitoring the amount of contact and the quality of feedback that faculty have with students in our online programs, reviewing student feedback, conducting content reviews and evaluating the learning outcomes achieved by students. If we determine that a faculty member is not performing at the level that we require, we work with the faculty member to improve performance, including, among other things, assigning him or her a mentor or through other means. If the faculty member&#146;s performance does not improve, we terminate the faculty member&#146;s contract and employment. 

&#160;

Student Support Services 

Encouraging students that enter Grand Canyon University to complete their degree programs is critical to our success. We focus on developing and providing resources that simplify the student enrollment process, acclimate students to our programs and our online environment, support the student educational experience, and track student performance toward degree completion. Many of our support services, including academic, administrative, and library services, are accessible online and are available to our online and ground students, allowing users to access these services at a time and in a manner that is generally convenient to them. The student support services we provide include: 

Academic services. We provide students with a variety of services designed to support their academic studies. Our Learning Lounge offers research services, writing services, and other tutoring services. Learning sessions are offered on a one-on-one basis and group sessions. 

Administrative services. We provide students with the ability to access a variety of administrative services both telephonically and via the Internet. For example, students can apply for financial aid, pay their tuition, order their transcripts online, and apply for graduation. We believe this online accessibility provides the convenience and self-service capabilities that our students value. Our student services advisors provide personalized online and telephonic support to our students. 

Library services. We provide a mix of online and ground resources, services, and instruction to support the educational and research endeavors of all students, faculty, and staff, including ground and online libraries and a qualified library staff that is available to help faculty and students with research, teaching, and library resource instruction. Collectively, our library services meet, or exceed, the requirements set by relevant accrediting bodies for us to offer undergraduate, master&#146;s, and doctoral programs. 

Career services. For those students seeking to change careers or explore new career opportunities, we offer career services support, including resume review and evaluation, career planning workshops, and access to career services specialists for advice and support. Other resources that we offer include a Job Readiness Program, which advises students on matters such as people skills, resumes and cover letters, mock interviews, and business etiquette; a job board, which advertises employment postings and career exploration opportunities; career counseling appointments and consultations; and career fairs. 

Technology support services. We provide online technical support 18 hours per day during the week and 17 hours per day on weekends to help our students remedy technology-related issues. We also provide online tutorials and &#147;Frequently Asked Questions&#148; for students who are new to online coursework. 

Marketing, Recruitment, Admissions and Retention 

Marketing. We engage in a range of marketing activities designed to position us as a provider of academically rigorous, professionally relevant educational programs, build strong brand recognition in our core disciplines, differentiate us from other educational providers, raise awareness among prospective students, generate enrollment inquiries, and stimulate student and alumni referrals. We target our online programs to working adults focused on program quality, convenience, and career advancement goals. We target our ground programs to traditional college students, working adults seeking a high quality education in a traditional college setting, and working adults seeking to take classes with a cohort onsite at our leased facilities or at their employer&#146;s facility. In marketing our programs to prospective students, we emphasize the value of the educational experience and the academic rigor and professional relevancy of the programs, as well as the cost of the program. We believe this approach reinforces the qualities that we want associated with our brand and also attracts students who tend to be more persistent in starting and finishing their programs. 

Recruitment. Once a prospective student has indicated an interest in enrolling in one of our programs, our lead management system identifies and directs an admissions advisor to initiate immediate communication. The admissions advisor serves as the primary, direct contact for the prospective student and the advisor&#146;s goal is to help that individual gain sufficient knowledge and understanding of our programs so that he or she can assess whether there is a good match between our offerings and the prospective student&#146;s goals. Upon the prospective student&#146;s submission of an application, the admissions advisor, together with our student services personnel, works with the applicant to gain acceptance, arrange financial aid, if needed, register for courses, and prepare for matriculation. 

Admissions. Admission to Grand Canyon University is available to qualified students who are at least 16 years of age. Undergraduate applicants may qualify in various ways, including by having a high school diploma, certain minimum grade point average levels, certain minimum composite scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or on the ACT test, or certain minimum scores on the General Education Development (GED) tests. Some of our programs require a higher grade point average and/or other criteria to qualify for admission. Applicants to our graduate programs must generally have an undergraduate degree from an accredited college, university, or program with a grade point average of 2.8 or greater, or a graduate degree from an accredited college, university, or program. In addition, some students who do not meet the qualifications for admission may be accepted with specification. A student being considered for such admission may be asked to submit additional information such as personal references and an essay addressing academic history. Students may also need to schedule an interview to help clarify academic goals and help us make an informed decision. 

&#160;

Retention. A key component in retaining our students is providing an outstanding learning experience. We feel that our team-based, proactive approach to recruitment and enhanced student services results in increased retention due to our systematic approach to contacting students at key milestones during their enrollment, providing encouragement and highlighting their achievements. Our student services advisors proactively assist each student with the student&#146;s selection of an appropriate payment option, and monitor the student&#146;s progress and account balance to ensure a smooth financial aid experience and to help ensure our students are well prepared for the financial obligations they incur. These advisors also assist students with their academic schedules and regularly monitor &#147;triggering events,&#148; such as the failure to participate in the classroom or failure to matriculate in a timely manner, which signal that a student may be at-risk for dropping out. Upon identifying an at-risk student, these advisors proactively interact with the student to resolve any issues and encourage the student to continue with his or her program. We have found that personally involving our employees in the student educational process, and proactively seeking to resolve issues before they become larger problems, can significantly increase retention rates among students. These frequent interactions between student services advisors and students are a key component to our retention strategy. 

Enrollment 

At December 31, 2015, we had 74,506 students enrolled in our courses, of which 59,311, or 79.6%, were enrolled in our online programs, and 15,195, or 20.4%, were enrolled in our ground programs. Of our students in online programs, which were geographically distributed throughout all 50 states of the United States, and Canada, and in professional studies programs, 87.1% were age 25 or older. Of our traditional on-campus students, 93.8% were under age 25 and, although we draw students from throughout the United States, a majority were from Arizona.

(1) &#160; Enrollment at December 31, 2015 and 2014 represents individual students who attended a course during the last two months of the calendar quarter. Includes 679 and 585 students pursuing non-degree certificates at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (2) &#160; Includes 6,302 and 5,570 students pursuing doctoral degrees at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. (3) &#160; As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 47.8% and 46.0%, respectively, of our working adult students (online and professional studies students) were pursuing graduate or doctoral degrees. (4) &#160; Includes our traditional on-campus students, as well as our professional studies students. Tuition and Fees 

For the 2014-15 academic year (the academic year begins in May), our prices per credit hour range from $350 to $465 for undergraduate online and professional studies courses, $325 to $600 for graduate online courses, $630 for doctoral online programs, and $688 for undergraduate courses for ground students. For our active duty military and active reserve online and professional studies students, our prices per credit hour are $250 for undergraduate, $400 for graduate courses and $599 for doctoral courses. The overall price of each course varies based upon the number of credit hours per course (with most courses representing four credit hours), the degree level of the program, and the discipline. In addition, we charge a fixed $8,250 &#147;block tuition&#148; for undergraduate ground students taking between 12 and 18 credit hours per semester, with an additional $688 per credit hour for credits in excess of 18. A traditional undergraduate degree typically requires a minimum of 120 credit hours. The minimum number of credit hours required for a master&#146;s degree and overall cost for such a degree varies by program, although such programs typically require approximately 36 credit hours. The doctoral program requires approximately 60 credit hours. A tuition increase of approximately 1% was implemented for the majority of online programs in September 2015. The University has not raised tuition for its traditional ground programs in seven years. 

&#160;

Based on current tuition rates, tuition for a full program would generally equate to between $15,450 and $37,000 for an online master&#146;s program, between $42,600 and $56,400 for a full four-year online bachelor&#146;s program, $38,400 for a full doctoral program, and approximately $66,000 for a full four-year bachelor&#146;s program taken on our ground campus. The tuition amounts referred to above assume no reductions for transfer credits or scholarships, which many of our students utilize to reduce their total program costs. For example, the average student on our ground traditional campus will pay approximately $8,300 in tuition in the 2015-16 school year after scholarships. Thus, based on the number of transfer credits and the scholarships they receive it is likely that a student will pay less than $34,000 in tuition for a bachelor&#146;s degree on our ground campus. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our revenue was reduced by approximately $163.9 million, $140.0 million and $111.8 million, respectively, as a result of scholarships that we offered to our students. The increase in scholarships reflects our increasing use of academic scholarships, to attract high performing students to our ground traditional campus. 

We have established a refund policy for tuition and fees based upon individual course start dates. Under our policy, for courses offered through a working adult modality, generally if a student drops or withdraws from a course before the course begins, 100% of the charges for tuition and fees are refunded. If a student drops or withdraws from a course during the first week of the course, 75% of the charges for tuition are refunded. If a student drops or withdraws from a course during or after the second week of a course, tuition charges and fees are not refunded. Most fees, including materials fees, are non-refundable for non-traditional students after the start of a course. We will refund tuition and fees according to the above policy unless a student attending courses online is a resident of a state that requires us to comply with different, state specific guidelines. For traditional students attending 15-week courses, generally if a student withdraws before the course begins, 100% of the charges for tuition and fees are refunded. If a student withdraws during the first week of the course, 90% of the charges for tuition are refunded and instructional fees and ground campus-related fees are refunded. If a student drops or withdraws from a course during the second week of a course, 75% of the tuition charges are refunded but most fees are non-refundable. If a student drops during the third week of a course, 50% of the tuition charges are refunded and during or after the fourth week, there are no refunds for tuition charges. Fees charged by us include graduation fees as well as fees for access to certain educational resources such as online materials. This tuition and fees refund policy is different from, and applies in addition to, the return of Title IV funds policy we are required to follow as a condition of our participation in the Title IV programs. 

Sources of Student Financing 

Our students finance their education through a combination of methods, as follows: 

Title IV programs. The federal government provides for grants and loans to students under the Title IV programs, and students can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible by the Department of Education. Student financial aid under the Title IV programs is primarily awarded on the basis of a student&#146;s financial need, which is generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount the student and the student&#146;s family can reasonably contribute to that cost. All students receiving Title IV program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study. In addition, each school must ensure that Title IV program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students. 

During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we derived approximately 74.8% and 76.5%, respectively, of our net revenues (calculated on a cash basis in accordance with Department of Education standards currently in effect) from tuition financed under the Title IV programs. The primary Title IV programs that our students receive funding from are the Federal Direct Loan program or FDL Program, and the Federal Pell Grant, or Pell, Program. 

Student loans administered through the FDL Program are currently the most significant source of U.S. federal student aid. There are two types of federal student loans: subsidized loans, which are based on the U.S. federal statutory calculation of student need, and unsubsidized loans, which are not need-based. Neither type of student loan is based on creditworthiness although annual and aggregate loan limits apply based on a student&#146;s grade level. Students are not responsible for interest on subsidized loans while the student is enrolled in school. However, the interest subsidy was temporarily eliminated for those students who received a direct Stafford loan with a first disbursement made on or after July 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2014. The interest subsidy for subsidized loans was reinstated for direct Stafford loans with a first disbursement after July 1, 2014. Students are responsible for the interest on unsubsidized loans while enrolled in school, but have the option to defer payment while enrolled. Repayment on federal student loans begins six months after the date the student ceases to be enrolled. The loans are repayable over the course of 10 years and, in some cases, longer. Both graduate and undergraduate students are eligible for loans. During 2015, federal student loans (both subsidized and unsubsidized) represented approximately 82.8% of the gross Title IV funds that we received. 

&#160;

Grants under the Pell Program (Pell Grants) are awarded based on need and only to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor&#146;s or professional degree. Unlike loans, Pell Grants are not repayable. During fiscal year 2015, Pell Grants represented approximately 13.7% of the gross Title IV funds that we received. For the 2014-2015 award year, the maximum amount available under Pell Grants was $5,730 and the maximum income that makes an applicant for Title IV Program funds eligible for an automatic zero Expected Family Contribution was $24,000. For the 2015-16 award year, the maximum amount available under Pell Grants was increased to $5,775 and the maximum income that makes an applicant for Title IV Program funds eligible for an automatic zero Expected Family Contribution remained at $24,000. 

Our students also receive funding under other Title IV programs, including the Federal Perkins Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program, the Federal Work-Study Program, and the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant Program. 

Other financial aid programs. In addition to the Title IV programs listed above, eligible students may participate in several other financial aid programs or receive support from other governmental sources. These include veterans educational benefits administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and state financial aid programs. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we derived an immaterial amount of our net revenue from tuition financed by such programs. 

Private loans. Some of our students also use private loan programs to help finance their education. Students can apply to a number of different lenders for private loans at current market interest rates. Private loans are intended to fund a portion of students&#146; cost of education not covered by the Title IV programs and other financial aid. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, payments derived from private loans constituted less than 1% of our net revenues for each year, respectively. 

Other sources. We derived the remainder of our net revenue from tuition that is self-funded or attributable to employer tuition reimbursements. 

Technology Systems and Management 

We believe that we have established secure, reliable and scalable technology systems that provide a high quality educational environment and that give us the capability to substantially grow our online and traditional programs and enrollment. 

Online course delivery and management . In 2010, we entered into an agreement with an affiliated entity to develop a new learning management system for our use. Through this agreement, we prepaid perpetual license fees, acquired source code rights for the software developed, and prepaid maintenance and service fees, for an aggregate amount of $4.9 million. Through our modular implementation of this platform, called LoudCloud, we have a platform that can scale to support our growing student population. The platform provides in depth analytics that allows us to closely monitor student success and the quality of our instructional resources. All ground and online students receive online course delivery and resources through this learning management platform. 

Internal administration. We utilize a commercial customer relations management software package to distribute, manage, track, and report on all interactions with prospective student leads as well as all active and inactive students. This software is scalable to capacity levels well in excess of current requirements. We also utilize a commercial software package to track Title IV funds, student records, grades, accounts receivable, accounts payable and general ledger. 

Infrastructure. We operate two data centers, one at our campus and one at another Phoenix-area location. All of our servers are networked and we have redundant data backup. We manage our technology environment internally. Our wide area network uses fully redundant technology to ensure maximum uptime, bandwidth capacity and network performance while allowing the flexibility needed to bring on additional data centers and remote sites as needed. Student access is load balanced for maximum performance. Real-time monitoring provides current system status across server, network, and storage components. 

Ground Campus 

We own our ground campus, which is located on 200+ acres in the center of the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area, near downtown Phoenix. Our on-campus facilities currently consist of classroom buildings, lecture halls, a 300-seat theater, a newly renovated library, a media arts complex that provides communications students with audio and video equipment, a 55,000 square foot recreation center for both student-athletes and on-campus students, a 140,000 square foot/ 7,500 seat basketball and entertainment arena, a gymnasium, an activity center that contains a food court, a bowling alley and other student services, a student union which was recently remodeled and expanded, residence halls, apartments, campus pools, athletic facilities and parking garages. Additionally, we have several office buildings used for administration. In order to accommodate the continued growth of our traditional ground population, we completed four additional residence halls, an additional classroom building for our College of Science, Engineering and Technology and a third parking structure prior to the 2015/2016 school year and has recently started construction on three apartment style residence halls, a 170,000 square foot classroom building for its College of Science, Engineering and Technology, a student service center and a fourth parking structure. 

&#160;

We have 22 intercollegiate athletic teams that currently compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (&#147;NCAA&#148;). Our athletic facilities include the University Arena (a 7,500 seat venue for all men&#146;s and women&#146;s basketball games plus select other GCU athletic competitions, concerts, speakers and other events), and a competition/practice gymnasium, which accommodates basketball, volleyball, and wrestling competitive events. In addition, the University&#146;s 55,000 square foot student recreation center has state of the art training facilities for our 400 student-athletes plus practice space and locker rooms for men&#146;s and women&#146;s basketball and wrestling. Our baseball, softball and track and field programs utilize on-campus practice and competition sites. An on-campus soccer facility which includes classrooms and team locker facilities in addition to 3,000 permanent seats and grassed berm seating to accommodate another 3,000 fans will be completed in Spring 2016. In January 2016 the Grand Canyon University Championship golf course opened to the public. The men&#146;s and women&#146;s golf teams have dedicated practice facilities, a team room and coaches offices at the course. Tennis, cross-country and swimming programs utilize off-campus sites for practice and competition. The University won the 2012-13 and 2011-12 Learfield Sports Directors Cup as the top overall NCAA Division II intercollegiate athletic program based on the combined success in all of the sports in which we competed. We advanced 16 of 22 programs into NCAA Championship competition and gained top 10 finishes in nine separate sports. In November 2012, we accepted an invitation to be a member of the NCAA Division I Western Athletic Conference beginning with the 2013-14 academic year and in September 2013 we began playing full Division I schedules. In June 2015, the University completed requirements for year 2 of the four year reclassification period and were passed on to &#147;year three&#148; in the membership process. In the first two years of membership in the Western Athletic Conference the Women&#146;s Indoor Track and Field, Softball, Baseball and Women&#146;s Tennis teams won regular season conference titles. GCU televises home athletic events in multiple sports highlighted by the men&#146;s basketball games that have averaged approximately 5,500 fans per night with most games played when the students are not on semester break at or near capacity. 

We believe our ground-based programs and traditional campus not only offer our ground students, faculty, and staff an opportunity to participate in a traditional college experience, but also provide our online students, faculty, and staff with a sense of connection to a traditional university. Additionally, our full-time ground faculty play an important role in integrating online faculty into our academic programs and ensuring the overall consistency and quality of the ground and online student experience. We believe the mix of our online program with our traditional ground-based program with a greater than 60-year history and heritage differentiates us from other for-profit postsecondary education providers. 

We intend to continue to expand the size and enhance the profile and reputation of our ground campus by, among other things, adding faculty, excelling in the performance areas such as athletics, debate, theatre, music and dance, expanding upon our campus infrastructure and technological capabilities, and potentially adding additional locations in the Southwest United States. These activities will require significant capital expenditures. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed over 3,650 full-time faculty, and staff and administrative personnel in university services, academic advising and academic support, enrollment services, university administration, financial aid, information technology, human resources, corporate accounting, finance, and other administrative functions. None of our employees is a party to any collective bargaining or similar agreement with us. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. 

Competition 

There are more than 4,000 U.S. colleges and universities serving traditional and adult students. Competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography, program offerings, modality, ownership, quality level, and selectivity of admissions. No one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market. 

Our ground program competes with Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University, and the University of Arizona, the in-state public universities, as well as two-year colleges within the state community college system. Our ground program also competes with geographically proximate universities with similar religious heritages, including Azusa Pacific University, Baylor University, and Pepperdine University. Our online programs compete with local, traditional universities geographically located near each of our prospective students, and with other for-profit postsecondary schools that offer online degrees, particularly those schools that offer online graduate programs within our core disciplines. 

Non-profit institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. Accordingly, non-profit institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those in the for-profit sector. In addition, some of our competitors, including both traditional colleges and universities and other for-profit schools, have substantially greater name recognition and financial resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students. We also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including established colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs. 

&#160;

We believe that the competitive factors in the postsecondary education market include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; availability of professionally relevant and accredited program offerings; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the types of degrees offered and the marketability of those degrees; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; reputation, regulatory approvals, and compliance history of the school; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; convenient, flexible and dependable access to programs and classes; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; qualified and experienced faculty; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; quality of the ground campus facilities; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; level of student support services; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; cost of the program; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; marketing and selling effectiveness; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the time necessary to earn a degree. Proprietary Rights 

We own or are licensed to use various intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and domain names. We license the right to utilize the name of Jerry Colangelo in connection with our Colangelo School of Sports Business that we operate within the business school, and we have spent significant resources in related branding efforts. While such intellectual property rights are important to us, we do not believe that the loss of any individual property right or group of related rights would have a material adverse effect on our overall business.

REGULATION 

We are subject to extensive regulation by state education agencies, accrediting commissions, and the federal government through the Department of Education under the Higher Education Act. The regulations, standards, and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, athletics and financial condition. 

As an institution of higher education that grants degrees and certificates, we are required to be authorized by appropriate state education authorities. These state education authorities also exercise regulatory oversight of our institution. In addition, in order to participate in the federal student financial aid programs, we must be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the Department of Education. Accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution submits to qualitative review by an organization of peer institutions, based on the standards of the accrediting commission and the stated aims and purposes of the institution. The Higher Education Act requires accrediting commissions recognized by the Department of Education to review and monitor many aspects of an institution&#146;s operations and to take appropriate action if the institution fails to meet the accrediting commission&#146;s standards. 

&#160;

Our operations are also subject to regulation by the Department of Education due to our participation in the federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Those Title IV programs include educational loans with below-market interest rates that are issued by the federal government under the Federal Direct Loan program (the &#147;FDL Program&#148;), as well as grant programs for students with demonstrated financial need. To participate in the Title IV programs, a school must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agency or agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the Department of Education, and be certified as an eligible institution by the Department of Education. 

Our business activities are planned and implemented to comply with the standards of these regulatory agencies. We employ a Vice President of Student Financial Aid Compliance who is knowledgeable about regulatory matters relevant to student financial aid programs and our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs and General Counsel also provide oversight designed to ensure that we meet the requirements of our regulated operating environment. 

State Education Licensure and Regulation 

We are authorized to offer our educational programs by the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education, the regulatory agency governing private postsecondary educational institutions in the State of Arizona, where we are located. We do not presently have campuses in any states other than Arizona, although we do have one location in Albuquerque, New Mexico. We are required by the Higher Education Act to maintain authorization from the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education in order to participate in the Title IV programs. This authorization is very important to us and our business. To maintain our state authorization, we must continuously meet standards relating to, among other things, educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, marketing and recruitment, financial operations, addition of new locations and educational programs, and various operational and administrative procedures. Our failure to comply with the requirements of the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education could result in us losing our authorization to offer our educational programs, which would cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs and could force us to cease operations. Alternatively, the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education could restrict our ability to offer certain degree and non-degree programs. 

We are an approved institutional participant in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA). SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. It is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a national Council (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts, for which Arizona is a W-SARA member. There is a yearly renewal for participating in NC-SARA and AZ-SARA and institutions must agree to meet certain requirements to participate. 

Some states that do not participate in SARA impose regulatory requirements on out-of-state educational institutions operating within their boundaries, such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state. We currently enroll students in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although we are currently licensed, authorized, in-process, or exempt in all non-SARA jurisdictions in which we operate, if we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements for a state, or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required, we could lose our state license or authorization by that state or be subject to other sanctions, including restrictions on our activities in, and fines and penalties imposed by, that state, as well as fines, penalties, and sanctions imposed by the Department of Education. While we do not believe that any of the states in which we are currently licensed or authorized, other than Arizona, are individually material to our operations, the loss of licensure or authorization in any state could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state, which could significantly reduce our enrollments. 

Individual state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters, some of which are different than the standards prescribed by the Department of Education or the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education. Laws in some states limit schools&#146; ability to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states. Some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of the Department of Education, and many require the posting of surety bonds. In non-SARA states, regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states, and can change frequently. Laws, regulations, or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could also increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160;

State Professional Licensure 

Many states have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed as a professional in specified fields, including fields such as education and healthcare, and counseling. These requirements vary by state and by field. A student&#146;s success in obtaining licensure following graduation typically depends on several factors, including the background and qualifications of the individual graduate, as well as the following factors, among others: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; whether the program from which the student graduated meets all requirements for professional licensure in that state; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; whether the institution and the program are accredited and, if so, by what accrediting commissions; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; whether the institution&#146;s degrees are recognized by other states in which a student may seek to work. Many states also require that graduates pass a state test or examination as a prerequisite to becoming certified in certain fields, such as teaching and nursing. Many states will certify individuals if they have already been certified in another state. 

Our College of Education is approved by the Arizona State Department of Education to offer Institutional Recommendations (credentials) for the certification of elementary, secondary, and special education teachers and school administrators. Our College of Nursing and Health Care Professions is approved by the Arizona State Board of Nursing for the Bachelor of Science in Nursing and advanced practice Master of Science in Nursing degrees. Our College of Humanities and Social Sciences is approved by the National Addiction Studies Accreditation Commission (NASAC). Due to varying requirements for professional licensure and certification in states other than Arizona, we inform students of the risks associated with obtaining professional licensure or certification and that it is each student&#146;s responsibility to determine what state, local or professional licensure and certification requirements are necessary in his or her individual state. 

In addition, the Department of Education convened a negotiated rulemaking to discuss, among other issues, teacher training requirements under the Higher Education Act generally and in connection with institutional applicability for the TEACH Grant. In April 2012, the negotiating committee ceased its work without reaching consensus. On December 3, 2014, the Department of Education published proposed new federal standards in the Federal Register related to teacher training programs and new standards applicable to the TEACH Grant. The comment period for that proposed regulation ended on February 2, 2015. As with other Department of Education proposals, the Department of Education may change the proposed rule for a number of reasons, including in light of comments received. We are still evaluating the proposed rule and will follow this issue. 

Accreditation 

We have been continuously accredited since 1968 by the Higher Learning Commission and its predecessor, each a regional accrediting commission recognized by the Department of Education. Our accreditation was reaffirmed in 2007 for a ten-year period, and the next scheduled comprehensive evaluation will be conducted in 2016-2017. Accreditation is a private, non-governmental process for evaluating the quality of educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, and financial stability. To be recognized by the Department of Education, accrediting commissions must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions, and publicly designate those institutions that meet their criteria. An accredited school is subject to periodic review by its accrediting commissions to determine whether it continues to meet the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation. 

There are six regional accrediting commissions recognized by the Department of Education, each with a specified geographic scope of coverage, which together cover the entire United States. Most traditional, public and private non-profit, degree-granting colleges and universities are accredited by one of these six regional accrediting commissions. The Higher Learning Commission, which accredits Grand Canyon University, is the same regional accrediting commission that accredits such universities as the University of Arizona, Arizona State University, and other degree-granting public, private non-profit, and proprietary colleges and universities in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. 

Accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission is important to us for several reasons, including the fact that it enables our students to receive Title IV financial aid. Other colleges and universities depend, in part, on an institution&#146;s accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating candidates&#146; credentials, and students and corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards. If we fail to satisfy the standards of the Higher Learning Commission, we could lose our accreditation by that agency, which would cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs. 

&#160;

In addition to institutional accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission, there are numerous specialized accrediting commissions that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction, many of which are in healthcare and professional fields. Accreditation of specific programs by one of these specialized accrediting commissions signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of those agencies. In addition to being institutionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, we also have the following specialized accreditations: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs accredits our Master of Business Administration degree program and emphases and our Bachelor of Science degree programs in Accounting, Business Administration, Business Administration with emphasis in Business Intelligence, Marketing, Sports Management and Entrepreneurship; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education accredits our Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing degree programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education accredits our Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The National Addiction Studies Accreditation Commission accredits our Master of Science in Addiction Counseling Program. If we fail to satisfy the standards of any of these specialized accrediting commissions, we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their fields. 

Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs 

To be eligible to participate in the Title IV programs, an institution must comply with specific requirements contained in the Higher Education Act and the regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Education. An institution must, among other things, be licensed or authorized to offer its educational programs by the state in which it is physically located (in our case, Arizona) and maintain institutional accreditation by an accrediting commission recognized by the Department of Education (in our case, the Higher Learning Commission). 

The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed to schools through the Title IV programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for-profit educational institutions have caused Congress to require the Department of Education to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for-profit educational institutions. As a result, our institution is subject to extensive oversight and review. Because the Department of Education periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict with certainty how the Title IV program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. 

Significant regulations and other factors relating to the Title IV programs that could adversely affect us include the following: 

Congressional action. Congress must reauthorize the Higher Education Act on a periodic basis, usually every five to six years, and the most recent reauthorization occurred in August 2008. The reauthorized Higher Education Act reauthorized all of the Title IV programs in which we participate, but made numerous revisions to the requirements governing the Title IV programs, including provisions relating to student loan default rates and the formula for determining the maximum amount of revenue that institutions are permitted to derive from the Title IV programs. In addition, members of Congress periodically introduce legislation that would impact Title IV programs and our industry generally. Because a significant percentage of our revenue is derived from the Title IV programs, any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or our ability or the ability of our students to participate in the Title IV programs could increase our costs of compliance, reduce the ability of some students to finance their education at our institution, require us to seek to arrange for other sources of financial aid for our students and materially decrease our student enrollment. 

Regulatory changes. Since October 2010, the Department of Education promulgated new rules related to Title IV program integrity issues. The most significant of these rules for our business are the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Modification of the standards relating to the prohibition on payment of incentive compensation to employees involved in student recruitment and enrollment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Implementation of standards for state authorization of institutions of higher education; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expansion of the definition of misrepresentation, relating to the Department of Education&#146;s authority to suspend or terminate an institution&#146;s participation in Title IV programs if the institution engages in substantial misrepresentation about the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates, and expansion of the sanctions that the Department of Education may impose for engaging in a substantial misrepresentation. Although most of the rules were effective in July 2011, parts of the rules, including those related to state authorization of online programs and parts of the rule on misrepresentation, were vacated as a result of a June 2012 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 

On October 20, 2014, the Department of Education published the final rules related to the implementation of the Section 304 of the Violence Against Women Act of 2013. These rules, which add additional compliance requirements related to the Clery Act, address issues related to campus crime, sexual assault, and various administrative requirements in support of maintaining a campus free of sexual discrimination. Although these requirements have added modest costs associated with compliance, management does not believe these costs have had a material effect on our business. 

On October 31, 2014, the Department of Education published the final gainful employment rule. This was a follow up to a 2011 effort by the Department to adopt a definition of what it means to provide a program leading to &#147;gainful employment in a recognized profession,&#148; which was largely overturned by a 2012 district court decision. For more information see Gainful Employment Rule below. 

On June 2, 2015, the Department of Education released a memorandum regarding enforcement of the prohibition on the payment of incentive compensation by postsecondary institutions to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admissions activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance based directly or indirectly upon success in securing enrollments or financial aid. Institutions agree to comply with the incentive compensation rules as a condition of their participation in the Title IV financial aid programs. The memorandum indicated that the Department of Education will revert to its pre-2002 approach to measuring damages for noncompliance with the prohibition against incentive compensation. That approach holds institutions liable to the Department of Education for up to the entire amount of federal student aid provided to students who were recruited in violation of the incentive compensation prohibition. As a result, should an institution be found to have violated the incentive compensation prohibition, it may be required to return all federal student aid received for students who were recruited in violation of the prohibition. 

On September 12, 2015, the Department released its consumer data tool &#147;The New Scorecard&#148;. This data set was released in lieu of the previously contemplated college ranking system. The impact of this new consumer data tool cannot be predicted. However, if information in the data set is used to compare schools with materially different demographics and missions without appropriate qualifications, it could cast a negative light on the proprietary sector generally, and our reputation and enrollment could be adversely affected 

On October 27, 2015, the Department of Education announced the publication of final regulations to amend its cash management regulations, which we refer to as the Cash Management Regulations. The Cash Management Regulations go into effect on July 1, 2016. Among other topics, the Cash Management Regulations address arrangements between postsecondary institutions and financial account providers to disburse Title IV program credit balances to students, including through the use of debit or prepaid cards. The Cash Management Regulations require institutions to establish a process to facilitate student choice in how students receive Title IV program federal student financial aid credit balances; limit the personally identifiable information about students that may be shared with financial account providers; and require institutions to obtain student consent before opening an account in the student&#146;s name. Under the Cash Management Regulations, an institution that has entered into an arrangement with a financial account provider must mitigate certain fees incurred by Title IV aid recipients, and certain types of fees are prohibited. The Cash Management Regulations require that contracts governing arrangements with financial account providers be publicly disclosed and evaluated in light of the best financial interests of students. The Cash Management Regulations also make other changes to requirements for the institutional administration of Title IV programs, including by clarifying how previously passed coursework is treated for Title IV eligibility purposes, altering the requirements for converting clock hours to credit hours, and updating other provisions in the Department of Education&#146;s cash management regulations. For example, the Cash Management Regulations establish a requirement that institutions participating in the Title IV programs under the reimbursement or heightened cash monitoring payment methods must pay any credit balance due to a student before seeking reimbursement or a request for funds, respectively. The Cash Management Regulations also specify the circumstances under which an institution may include the cost of books and supplies as part of institutional tuition and fees charged to a student, such as if the institution has made arrangements with publishers to obtain books at below-market rates or if books or electronic course materials are not available elsewhere. We are currently assessing the impact of these regulations and are unable to predict the impact that compliance with the Cash Management Regulations might have on our operations and operating results, although we do not anticipate the impact to be material. 

&#160;

Eligibility and certification procedures. Each institution must apply periodically to the Department of Education for continued certification to participate in the Title IV programs. Such recertification generally is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change in control. An institution may also come under the Department of Education&#146;s review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new educational program or modifying the academic credentials it offers. The Department of Education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when an institution is certified for the first time or undergoes a change in control. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in the school&#146;s program participation agreement with the Department of Education. In addition, the Department of Education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school, or make any other significant change. If the Department of Education determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution&#146;s certification to participate in the Title IV programs without advance notice or opportunity for the institution to challenge the action. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. 

On October 28, 2013, the University received a new program participation agreement with full certification from the Department of Education, which gives the University the ability to participate in the Title IV programs through September 30, 2017. 

Administrative capability. Department of Education regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite &#147;administrative capability&#148; to participate in the Title IV programs. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; comply with all applicable Title IV program requirements; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; have an adequate number of qualified personnel to administer the Title IV programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; have acceptable standards for measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; not have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; have various procedures in place for awarding, disbursing and safeguarding Title IV funds and for maintaining required records; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; administer the Title IV programs with adequate checks and balances in its system of internal controls; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provide financial aid counseling to its students; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; refer to the Department of Education&#146;s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any student, parent, employee, third-party servicer or other agent of the institution has engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving the Title IV programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submit all required reports and consolidated financial statements in a timely manner; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria, the Department of Education may: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; require the institution to repay Title IV funds its students previously received; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; transfer the institution from the advance method of payment of Title IV funds to heightened cash monitoring status or the reimbursement system of payment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; place the institution on provisional certification status; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution&#146;s participation in the Title IV programs. If we are found not to have satisfied the Department of Education&#146;s administrative capability requirements, our students could lose, or be limited in their access to, Title IV program funding. 

&#160;

Financial responsibility. The Higher Education Act and Department of Education regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as Grand Canyon University must satisfy in order to participate in the Title IV programs. The Department of Education evaluates institutions for compliance with these standards on an annual basis based on the institution&#146;s annual audited consolidated financial statements, as well as when the institution applies to the Department of Education to have its eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs recertified. The most significant financial responsibility standard is the institution&#146;s composite score, which is derived from a formula established by the Department of Education based on three financial ratios: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; equity ratio, which measures the institution&#146;s capital resources, financial viability and ability to borrow; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution&#146;s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; net income ratio, which measures the institution&#146;s ability to operate at a profit or within its means. The Department of Education assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. The Department of Education then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. The composite score for an institution&#146;s most recent fiscal year must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department of Education oversight. Our composite scores for our fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 3.0, 3.0 and 2.9, respectively, and, therefore, we are considered financially responsible for purposes of these regulations. We have not yet submitted our consolidated financial statements to the Department of Education for our 2015 fiscal year, but have calculated that our composite score for the 2015 fiscal year will be 2.6. We have modeled our composite score for future years using, among other estimates, our estimated ground campus capital expenditures and believe that our composite score will remain at a financially responsible level for the foreseeable future. 

In addition to having an acceptable composite score, an institution must, among other things, provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with Title IV program requirements, meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds to students and any Title IV liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments, and not receive an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited consolidated financial statements. If the Department of Education were to determine that we did not meet the financial responsibility standards due to a failure to meet the composite score or other factors, we would expect to be able to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis permitted by the Department of Education, which could include, in the Department of Education&#146;s discretion, posting a letter of credit, accepting provisional certification, complying with additional Department of Education monitoring requirements, agreeing to receive Title IV program funds under an arrangement other than the Department of Education&#146;s standard advance funding arrangement, such as the reimbursement system of payment or heightened cash monitoring, and complying with or accepting other limitations on our ability to increase the number of programs we offer or the number of students we enroll. 

The requirement to post a letter of credit or other sanctions imposed by the Department of Education could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our cash flows. If we are unable to meet the minimum composite score or comply with the other standards of financial responsibility, and could not post a required letter of credit or comply with the alternative bases for establishing financial responsibility, our students could lose their access to Title IV program funding. 

Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw. When a student who has received Title IV program funds withdraws from school, the institution must determine the amount of Title IV program funds the student has &#147;earned&#148; and then must return the unearned Title IV program funds (a &#147;return to Title IV&#148;) to the appropriate lender or the Department of Education in a timely manner, which is generally no later than 45 days after the date the institution determined that the student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, the institution will be required to submit a letter of credit to the Department of Education equal to 25% of the Title IV funds that the institution should have returned for withdrawn students in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under Department of Education regulations, the letter of credit requirement is triggered by late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of the withdrawn students (and involving more than two student refunds) in the audit sample in the institution&#146;s annual Title IV compliance audit for either of the institution&#146;s two most recent fiscal years or in a Department of Education program review. We did not exceed this 5% threshold in our annual Title IV compliance audits for 2014 (the most recent year for which we have completed a Title IV compliance audit), 2013 or 2012. 

The &#147;90/10 Rule.&#148; A requirement of the Higher Education Act, commonly referred to as the &#147;90/10 Rule,&#148; that is applicable only to for-profit, postsecondary educational institutions like us, provides that an institution loses its eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenue for each of two consecutive fiscal years from Title IV program funds. For purposes of the 90/10 Rule, revenue is calculated under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of an institution&#146;s revenue under generally accepted accounting principles that appears in its consolidated financial statements. Under the 90/10 Rule, an institution becomes ineligible to participate in the Title IV programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which it exceeds the 90% threshold, and its period of ineligibility extends for at least two consecutive fiscal years. If an institution exceeds the 90% threshold for two consecutive fiscal years and it and its students have received Title IV funds during the subsequent period of ineligibility, the institution will be required to return those Title IV funds to the applicable lender or the Department of Education. If an institution&#146;s rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year, it will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years. 

&#160;

Using the Department of Education&#146;s cash-basis, regulatory formula under the 90/10 Rule as currently in effect, for our 2015, 2014, and 2013 fiscal years, we derived approximately 74.8%, 76.5%, and 78.5%, respectively, of our 90/10 Rule revenue from Title IV program funds. 

As a result of the continuing increase in the number of students attending our ground campus, who typically finance a greater percentage of their educational costs with non-Title IV sources of funds, we expect the percentage of our revenue that we receive from Title IV programs to remain stable or to continue to decrease in the future, although this may be impacted by recent changes in federal law that increased Title IV grant and loan limits, as well as the ongoing economic environment, which has adversely affected the employment circumstances of our students and their parents and increased their reliance on Title IV programs. If we were to exceed the 90% threshold for two consecutive years such that we lost our eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, or if Congress passed legislation changing how certain funds are counted under this rule, revising the percentage of income that proprietary schools must derive from non-federal sources, or both, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Student loan defaults. Under the Higher Education Act, an educational institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV programs if defaults by its students on the repayment of their federal student loans exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, the Department of Education calculates a rate of student defaults for each institution (known as a &#147;cohort default rate&#148;). The reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 2008 extended the measurement period for cohort default rates so that the rate is calculated by determining the rate at which borrowers who became subject to their repayment obligation in one federal fiscal year default in that same year or by the end of the second year following federal fiscal year (the &#147;three-year method&#148;). 

The Department of Education applies legal thresholds to measure an institution&#146;s compliance. If the Department of Education notifies an institution that its cohort default rates exceeded 30%, for each of its three most recent federal fiscal years, the institution&#146;s participation in the FDL Program and the Pell grant program would end 30 days after that notification, unless the institution appeals that determination in a timely manner on specified grounds and according to specified procedures. In addition, an institution&#146;s participation in the FDL Program would end 30 days after notification by the Department of Education that its most recent cohort default rate, is greater than 40%, unless the institution timely appeals that determination on specified grounds and according to specified procedures. An institution whose participation ends under either of these provisions may not participate in the relevant programs for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the institution receives the notification or for the next two fiscal years. If an institution&#146;s cohort default rate for any single federal fiscal year equals or exceeds 30%, the Department of Education may place the institution on provisional certification status. 

Our cohort default rates on federal student loans for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 federal fiscal years, were 10.3%, 15.7% and 19.0%, respectively. 

Incentive compensation rule. An institution that participates in the Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity. Prior to July 1, 2011, Department of Education regulations included 12 &#147;safe harbors&#148; that described payments and arrangements that did not violate the incentive compensation rule. Under new rules effective July 1, 2011, the 12 safe harbors were eliminated. The restrictions of the incentive compensation rule, which extend to any third-party companies that an educational institution contracts with for student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding services, increase the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation. This makes the development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish. As such, these changes limit our ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities, which could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. 

Compliance reviews. We are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including the Department of Education, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, the applicable state approving agencies for financial assistance to veterans, and accrediting commissions. As part of the Department of Education&#146;s ongoing monitoring of institutions&#146; administration of the Title IV programs, the Higher Education Act also requires institutions to annually submit to the Department of Education a Title IV compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with applicable federal and Department of Education audit standards. In addition, to enable the Department of Education to make a determination of an institution&#146;s financial responsibility, each institution must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Department of Education regulations. 

&#160;

In connection with its administration of the Title IV federal student financial aid programs, the Department of Education periodically conducts program reviews at selected schools that receive Title IV funds. In July 2010, the Department of Education initiated a program review of Grand Canyon University covering the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 award years. On September 27, 2013, the University and the Department of Education entered into an agreement that fully resolved the findings in the preliminary program review report and closed the program review. A second program review, focused on the University&#146;s administration of the Title IV programs in which it participates, its administration of the Clery Act and related regulations, and its compliance with the requirements of the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 award years, was initiated in April 2014. The final program review determination letter received in June 2014 set forth three findings, each of which involved individual student-specific information gathering and/or reporting errors and all of which the University promptly corrected to the Department of Education&#146;s satisfaction. Accordingly, the final program review determination letter concluded that the University had taken all corrective actions necessary to resolve the findings and that the program review had been closed with no further action required. See &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#148; 

Privacy of student records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, and the Department of Education&#146;s FERPA regulations, require educational institutions to protect the privacy of students&#146; educational records by limiting an institution&#146;s disclosure of a student&#146;s personally identifiable information without the student&#146;s prior written consent. FERPA also requires institutions to allow students to review and request changes to their educational records maintained by the institution, to notify students at least annually of this inspection right, and to maintain records in each student&#146;s file listing requests for access to and disclosures of personally identifiable information and the interest of such party in that information. If an institution fails to comply with FERPA, the Department of Education may require corrective actions by the institution or may terminate an institution&#146;s receipt of further federal funds. In addition, educational institutions are obligated to safeguard student information pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, a federal law designed to protect consumers&#146; personal financial information held by financial institutions and other entities that provide financial services to consumers. GLBA and the applicable GLBA regulations require an institution to, among other things, develop and maintain a comprehensive, written information security program designed to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable financial information of students, parents, or other individuals with whom such institution has a customer relationship. If an institution fails to comply with the applicable GLBA requirements, it may be required to take corrective actions, be subject to monitoring and oversight by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and be subject to fines or penalties imposed by the FTC. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC with respect to their collection, use, and disclosure of student information. The institution must also comply with the FTC Red Flags Rule, a section of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, that requires the establishment of guidelines and policies regarding identity theft related to student credit accounts. 

Potential effect of regulatory violations. If we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing the Title IV programs, the Department of Education could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring us to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, requiring us to repay Title IV program funds, requiring us to post a letter of credit in favor of the Department of Education as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against us, initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate our participation in the Title IV programs, or referring the matter for civil or criminal prosecution. If such sanctions or proceedings were imposed against us and resulted in a substantial curtailment or termination of our participation in the Title IV programs, our enrollments, revenues, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 

If we lost our eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, or if the amount of available Title IV program funds was reduced, we would seek to arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or financial aid for students. We believe that one or more private organizations would be willing to provide financial assistance to our students, but there is no assurance that this would be the case. The interest rate and other terms of such financial aid would likely not be as favorable as those for Title IV program funds, and we might be required to guarantee all or part of such alternative assistance or might incur other additional costs in connection with securing such alternative assistance. It is unlikely that we would be able to arrange alternative funding on any terms to replace all the Title IV funding our students receive. Accordingly, our loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, or a reduction in the amount of available Title IV program funding for our students, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, even if we could arrange or provide alternative sources of revenue or student financial aid. 

In addition to the actions that may be brought against us as a result of our participation in the Title IV programs, we are also subject to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as present or former students or employees and other members of the public. 

State authorization . States have the authority to assert jurisdiction, to the extent they so choose, over educational institutions that offer online degree programs in a state but that otherwise have no physical location or other presence in that state. On November 20, 2013, the Department of Education announced its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to address state authorization of distance and correspondence learning programs. While these negotiated rulemaking sessions were held, the committee failed to reach consensus on all topics by the May 2014 conclusion of those sessions. The Department of Education has not yet published a notice of proposed rulemaking, so we do not yet know whether or how any such proposed rules would impact the University or when such rules may be published. The regulations proposed by the Department of Education prior to the May 2014 negotiating session, however, would impose significant new regulatory burdens on postsecondary institutions that provide distance education, regardless of educational sector. 

&#160;

We are an approved institutional participant in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA). SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. It is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a national Council (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts, for which Arizona is a W-SARA member. There is a yearly renewal for participating in NC-SARA and AZ-SARA, and institutions must agree to meet certain requirements to participate. 

In addition to Arizona, we have determined that our activities in some non-SARA states constitute a presence requiring licensure or authorization under the requirements of the state post-secondary education agency in those states, which we have obtained, while in other states we have determined that we are exempt under applicable state law from licensure or authorization requirements. In other states, we have obtained approvals to operate as we have determined necessary in connection with our marketing and recruiting activities. Although we have a process for evaluating the compliance of our online educational programs with state requirements regarding distance and correspondence learning, and have experienced no significant restrictions on our educational activities to date as a result of such requirements, state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and are subject to change. If we fail to comply with licensing or authorization requirements for a non-SARA state, or fail to obtain licenses or authorizations when required, we could lose our licensure or authorization from that state or be subject to other sanctions, including restrictions on our activities in that state, and fines and penalties, including Department of Education sanctions. The loss of licensure or authorization in a state other than Arizona could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering educational services to current students in that state, which could significantly reduce our enrollments. 

Approval of new programs. Department of Education rules effective July 1, 2011 imposed various requirements on an institution&#146;s ability to add new academic programs without prior approval of the Department of Education. While the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia subsequently invalidated this requirement, we believe there remains some uncertainty regarding new program approval, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to emerging employment trends and add programs that are responsive to those trends, which in turn could decrease our attractiveness to certain students. In addition, a lack of certainty could increase the risk of future federal False Claims Act qui tam lawsuits in which private plaintiffs assert that students improperly received Title IV aid while attending a program that has not been approved. 

Gainful employment rules. Under the Higher Education Act, proprietary schools are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to &#147;gainful employment in a recognized occupation,&#148; with the limited exception of qualified programs leading to a bachelor&#146;s degree in liberal arts. Historically, this concept has not been defined in detail. In October 2014, the Department of Education published final regulations, effective July 1, 2015, on the metrics for determining whether an academic program prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. This rule establishes requirements related to the debt to earnings ratio of graduates of our programs, and sets additional disclosure requirements for students. Under the final regulations, which apply on a program-by-program basis, students enrolled in a program will be eligible for Title IV student financial aid only if that program satisfies at least one of two tests relating to student debt service-to-earnings ratios. The two tests specify minimum debt service-to-earnings ratios calculated on the basis of the earnings of program graduates. One test measures student loan debt service as a percentage of total earnings, and the other test measures student loan debt service as a percentage of discretionary earnings. The first year a program fails to meet at least one of the minimum ratios for the year, the institution will be required to provide a warning notice to prospective and enrolled students advising that the program has not met the minimum debt measurements and describes any actions planned to improve the program&#146;s performance under the Debt Measurements. Programs that fail to meet at least one of the minimum ratios for two consecutive years or for two out of three of the most recent years for which Debt Measures were calculated, will be required to provide additional warning notices to students before enrollment. If the program does not meet any of the Debt Measures for three out of four years, it will lose its Title IV eligibility. 

Under the final regulations, schools are also required to certify to the Department the following for each Title IV eligible program: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The program is included in the schools&#146; accreditation; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The program is programmatically accredited, if required by a federal government entity, or by a government entity in any state in which the school is located or is required to obtain state approval; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The program satisfies any applicable state licensing and certification requirements for the occupations for which the program prepares students to enter; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The program is not substantially similar to a program offered by the school that became ineligible due to the student debt service-to-earnings ratios. &#160;

We believe we have successfully submitted the certifications required for all pre-existing programs prior to the December 31, 2015 deadline for doing so. In addition, in July and September 2015 we successfully submitted the data required of the University under the gainful employment rule. We believe we have materially complied with the reporting requirements and have not otherwise been notified by the Department. 

The Department of Education has indicated that the official 2014 gainful employment debt service-to-earnings ratios will most likely be issued in the winter of 2016. The expected timing of the issuance of the 2015 ratios has not yet been announced. We believe it is likely that some of University&#146;s programs will be impacted by the regulations. 

The Department of Education has not yet announced the protocol for calculating and disseminating the debt service-to-earnings ratios. Because the ratios will be issued by the Department of Education after the measuring period, we may not know of a program&#146;s failure to meet the tests until after the measuring period, and students enrolled in such a program could lose their access to federal financial aid before completing the program. 

This is a complicated rule and, although management will work to achieve compliance with this new rule, the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for Title IV funding is at risk due to factors measured by this rule and beyond our control, such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, and other factors. The exposure to these external factors could reduce our ability to confidently offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is market demand, and therefore would impact our ability to maintain or grow our business. Substantial misrepresentation . The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution that participates in Title IV programs from engaging in &#147;substantial misrepresentation&#148; of the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. The Department of Education has defined a misrepresentation as any statement made by the institution or a third party that provides educational programs, marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services to the institution that is false, erroneous or has the likelihood or tendency to deceive. A substantial misrepresentation is any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person&#146;s detriment. Considering the breadth of the definition of &#147;substantial misrepresentation,&#148; it is possible that despite our efforts to prevent such misrepresentations, our employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. As a result, we may face complaints from students and prospective students over statements made by us and our agents throughout the enrollment, admissions and financial aid process, as well as throughout attendance at the University, which would expose us to increased risk of enforcement action and applicable sanctions or other penalties and increased risk of private qui tam actions under the Federal False Claims Act. Under the new rules, if the Department of Education determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the Department of Education may revoke an institution&#146;s program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution&#146;s participation in Title IV programs, deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters, or initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. If the Department of Education determines that statements made by us or on our behalf are in violation of the regulations, we could be subject to sanctions and other liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Regulatory Standards that May Restrict Institutional Expansion or Other Changes 

Many actions that we may wish to take in connection with expanding our operations or other changes are subject to review or approval by the applicable regulatory agencies. In addition to those matters described in detail below, most state education agencies impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. See &#147;State Educational Licensure and Authorization.&#148; 

Adding teaching locations, implementing new educational programs, and increasing enrollment. The requirements and standards of state education agencies, accrediting commissions, and the Department of Education limit our ability in certain instances to establish additional teaching locations, implement new educational programs, or increase enrollment in certain programs. Many states require review and approval before institutions can add new locations or programs, and Arizona also limits the number of pre-licensure nursing students we may enroll (which represents a small portion of our overall nursing program). The Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education, the Higher Learning Commission, and other state education agencies and specialized accrediting commissions that authorize or accredit us and our programs generally require institutions to notify them in advance of adding new locations or implementing new programs, and upon notification may undertake a review of the quality of the facility or the program and the financial, academic, and other qualifications of the institution. 

&#160;

With respect to the Department of Education, if an institution participating in the Title IV programs plans to add a new location or educational program, the institution must generally apply to the Department of Education to have the additional location or educational program designated as within the scope of the institution&#146;s Title IV eligibility. However, a degree-granting institution, like Grand Canyon University, that is fully certified to participate in the Title IV programs is not required to obtain the Department of Education&#146;s approval of additional programs that lead to a bachelor&#146;s, professional, or graduate degree at the same degree level as programs previously approved by the Department of Education, and, similarly, is not required to obtain advance approval for new programs that prepare students for gainful employment in the same or a related recognized occupation as an educational program that has previously been designated by the Department of Education as an eligible program at that institution if it meets certain minimum-length requirements. 

Acquiring other schools. While we have not acquired any other schools in the past, we may seek to do so in the future. The Department of Education and virtually all state education agencies and accrediting commissions require a company to seek their approval if it wishes to acquire another school. In our case, we would need to obtain the approval of the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education or other state education agency that licenses the school being acquired, the Higher Learning Commission, any other accrediting commission that accredits the school being acquired, and the Department of Education. The level of review varies by individual state and accrediting commission, with some requiring approval of such an acquisition before it occurs and others only considering approval after the acquisition has occurred. The Higher Learning Commission would require us to obtain its advance approval of such an acquisition. The approval of the applicable state education agencies and accrediting commissions is a necessary prerequisite to the Department of Education certifying the acquired school to participate in the Title IV programs under our ownership. The restrictions imposed by any of the applicable regulatory agencies could delay or prevent our acquisition of other schools in some circumstances. 

Title IV program participation. Each institution must apply to the Department of Education for continued certification to participate in the Title IV programs at least every six years, or when it undergoes a change in control, and an institution may come under the Department of Education&#146;s review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding an educational program, or modifying the academic credentials that it offers. 

The Department of Education may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards. In addition, if a company acquires a school from another entity, or if a school undertakes another transaction that constitutes a change in control under Department of Education regulations, the school will automatically be placed on provisional certification when the Department of Education approves the transaction. During the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions or restrictions included in its program participation agreement with the Department of Education. If the Department of Education finds that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution&#146;s certification to participate in the Title IV programs without advance notice or advance opportunity for the institution to challenge that action. In addition, the Department of Education may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for recertification or approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school, or make any other significant change. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV program funds. 

On October 28, 2013, the University received a new program participation agreement with full certification from the Department of Education, which gives the University the ability to participate in the Title IV programs through September 30, 2017. 

Change in ownership resulting in a change in control. The Department of Education, as well as many accrediting commissions and states, require institutions of higher education to report or obtain approval of certain changes in control and changes in other aspects of institutional organization or control. With respect to publicly traded corporations, like us, Department of Education regulations provide that a change in control occurs if, among other things, the corporation has a stockholder that owns, or has voting control over, at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation (defined in the regulations as a &#147;controlling shareholder&#148;), and that controlling shareholder ceases to own, or have voting control over, at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder. Under Department of Education regulations, an institution that undergoes a change in control as defined by the Department of Education loses its eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs and must apply to the Department of Education in order to reestablish such eligibility. 

The Higher Learning Commission provides that an institution must obtain its approval in advance of a change in ownership, corporate control or structure in order for the institution to retain its accredited status. In June 2009, the Higher Learning Commission adopted new policies and standards for the review of transactions that may constitute such a change in control. One standard provides that a transaction may be considered a change in control if an individual, entity or group increases or decreases its control of shares to greater than or less than 25% of the total outstanding shares of the stock of a parent corporation that owns or controls the accredited institution. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the Higher Learning Commission requires the institution to obtain its approval in advance of the change, and in certain circumstances that process may require several weeks or several months or more to complete. In addition, following a change in control, the Higher Learning Commission will conduct an onsite evaluation within six months in order to continue the institution&#146;s accreditation. 

&#160;

Many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change in control requiring approval, but their thresholds for determining a change in control vary widely. The standards of the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education provide that an institution that is owned by a publicly traded company whose control is vested in the voting members of the board of directors, such as Grand Canyon Education, undergoes a change in control if 50% or more of the voting members of the board of directors change within a 12-month period or the chief executive officer of the corporation changes. A change in control under the definition of one of the other state agencies that regulate us might require us to obtain approval of a change in control in order to maintain our authorization to operate in that state, and in some cases such states could require us to obtain advance approval of the change in control. If we were to undergo a change in control under the standards of the Arizona State Board of Private Postsecondary Education at any time in the future, we would be required to file an application with the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education in order to obtain approval for such change in control. We cannot predict whether the Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education would impose any limitations or conditions on us, or identify any compliance issues related to us in the context of the change in control process, that could result in our loss of authorization in Arizona. Any such loss would result in our loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs which would cause a significant decline in our student enrollment.
