 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. is a corporation organized under the laws of Wyoming on April 25, 2006. We were organized to develop high strength fibers using recombinant DNA technology, for commercial applications in both the specialty fiber and technical textile industries. Specialty fibers are engineered for specific uses that require exceptional strength, flexibility, heat resistance and/or chemical resistance. The specialty fiber market is exemplified by two synthetic fiber products: aramid fibers and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber. The technical textile industry involves products for both industrial and consumer products, such as filtration fabrics, medical textiles (e.g., sutures and artificial ligaments), safety and protective clothing and fabrics used in military and aerospace applications (e.g., high-strength composite materials). 

&#160; 

We are using genetic engineering technologies to develop fibers with greater strength, resiliency and flexibility for use in our target markets, namely the textile, specialty fiber and technical textile industries. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Collaborative Research and Licensing 

&#160; 

In 2006, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with the University Of Wyoming, which granted the Company the exclusive global rights to use and commercialize patented genetic sequences in silkworm. In exchange for this license the University of Wyoming received $10,000 cash payment and the University of Wyoming Foundation received 17,050,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Under the terms of the licensing agreement, the Company is obligated to provide annual license fees of $10,000 and support the University research with $13,700 annually. As of today, the Company is current on the $10,000 per year payment and are accruing the $13,700 payments. No royalties are required. This agreement has remained unchanged since 2006. The Company has not signed any other agreements with the University of Wyoming. &#160; 

&#160; 

In 2007, the Company entered into the first of a series of collaborative research agreements with the University of Notre Dame (&#8220;Notre Dame&#8221;). The Company is contractually obligated to financially support the ongoing research and development of transgenic silkworms and the creation of recombinant silk fibers. In exchange, the Company has an option to obtain the exclusive global commercialization rights to the technology developed pursuant to the research effort. 

&#160; 

Following the first collative research agreement, the Company entered into successive collaborative research agreements to provide different levels of financial support. The trend has been for an increase in financial support for the research and development in nearly every successive agreement. In June 2012, we entered into the Intellectual Property / Collaborative Research Agreement with Notre Dame (&#8220;2012 Notre Dame Research Agreement&#8221;). On March 4, 2015 we entered into a new Intellectual Property / Collaborative Research Agreement with Notre Dame extending the agreement through March 2016 (&#8220;2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement&#8221;). Under the 2015 Notre Dame Research agreement the Company will provide approximately $534,000 in financial support. On September 20, 2015, this agreement was amended to increase the total funding by approximately $179,000. In February 2016, this agreement was extended to July 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

In 2011, the Company exercised its option to obtain the global commercialization rights to the technology developed under the collaborative research agreements with Notre Dame. That has resulted in a separate license agreement with Notre Dame. Pursuant to that license agreement, Notre Dame has filed an international patent application and numerous national patent applications on technology relating to the creation and use of recombinant spider silks. The license agreement obligates the Company to reimburse Notre Dame for costs associated with the filing, prosecuting and maintaining of such patents and patent applications. In exchange for the rights to commercialization, Notre Dame has received 2,200,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock and the Company has agreed to pay Notre Dame royalties of 2% of the Company&#8217;s gross sales of the licensed products and 10% of any sublicensing fees received by the Company on licensed technology. The Company has also agreed to pay to Notre Dame $50,000 a year, which will be reduced from the total amount of royalties paid in the same year. The $50,000 payment to Notre Dame is not owed for any year in which the Company is sponsoring research within Notre Dame. 

&#160; 

On October 15, 2013, the Company entered into an intellectual property agreement with a scientific researcher relating to the development of new recombinant silk fibers. Under the terms of that agreement, the scientific researcher would transfer to the Company his rights of intellectual property, inventions and trade secrets which the researcher develops relating to recombinant silk. The researcher received 8,000,000 common stock warrants from the Company, exercisable 24 months from the date of the agreement. The researcher would also receive additional warrants when and if the researcher develops advanced recombinant silk fibers for the Company&#8217;s use. Under the terms of the agreement, the researcher would receive 10,000,000 warrants in the event that he develops a new recombinant silk fiber with certain performance characteristics, and another 10,000,000 warrants if he develops a second recombinant silk fiber with certain characteristics. If the researcher performs the contract in good faith the consultant will be entitled to an additional 8,000,000 warrants on the two year anniversary of the agreement. The warrants described above all contain a cashless exercise provision and are exercisable on the 24 month anniversary of the date on which they were issuable under the agreement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On February 17, 2014, the Company entered into two consulting agreements with two consultants for independent technical expertise to further the Company&#8217;s development of recombinant spider silk and scientific research. As consideration for the services performed, the Company agrees to issue the following to each of the consultants: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Within 30 days of the date of this agreement, a warrant for six hundred thousand (600,000) shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to be exercisable on the 14 month anniversary of this agreement for a period of 12 months with a cashless exercise provision. Such warrant has been issued as of the date of this report. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Within 30 days of the date of this agreement, a warrant for one million shares (1,000,000) of the Company&#8217;s common stock to be exercisable on the 20 month anniversary of this agreement for a period of 12 months with a cashless exercise provision. Such warrant has been issued as of the date of this report. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Within 30 days of the date of this agreement, a warrant for two million (2,000,000) shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to be exercisable on the 32 month anniversary of this agreement for a period of 12 months with a cashless exercise provision. Such warrant has been issued as of the date of this report. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Based on the consultants reaching two sets of benchmarks, two separate warrants for one million five hundred thousand (1,500,000) shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to be exercisable on the 28 month anniversary of this agreement for a period of 12 months with a cashless exercise provision. Such warrant has not been issued as of the date of this report. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

On the three year anniversary, assuming the Board determines the consultant acted in good faith pursuant to the consulting agreements and the Company&#8217;s board of directors approves, additional warrants will be issued to consultants, as a bonus, for one million five hundred thousand shares (1,500,000) of the Company&#8217;s common stock to be exercisable on the 28 month anniversary of this agreement for a period of 12 months with a cashless exercise provision. As of the date of this Report, such warrants have not been issued. 

&#160; 

As of the date hereof, the Company has issued a total of 7,200,000 warrants under the foregoing two consulting agreements. 

&#160; 

On October 2, 2014, the Company entered into a letter agreement for an equity line of financing up to $7,500,000 (the &#8220;Letter Agreement&#8221;) with Calm Seas Capital, LLC (&#8220;Calm Seas&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Under the Letter Agreement, over a 24 month period from the effective date of a registration statement covering shares issuable to Calm Seas (the "Effective Date") we may put to Calm Seas up to an aggregate of $7,500,000 in shares of our Class A common stock for a purchase price equal to 80% of the lowest price of our Class A common stock during the five consecutive trading days immediately following the date we deliver notice to Calm Seas of our election to put shares pursuant to the Letter Agreement. We may put shares bi-monthly. The dollar value that will be permitted for each put pursuant to the Letter Agreement will be the lesser of: (A) the product of (i) 200% of the average daily volume in the US market of our Class A common stock for the ten trading days prior to the date we deliver our put notice to Calm Seas multiplied by (ii) the average of the daily closing prices for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the date we deliver our put notice to Calm Seas, or (B) $100,000. We will automatically withdraw our put notice to Calm Seas if the lowest closing bid price used to determine the purchase price of the put shares is not at least equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the average closing &#8220;bid&#8221; price for our Class A common stock for the ten (10) trading days prior to the date we deliver our put notice to Calm Seas. Notwithstanding the $100,000 ceiling for each bi-monthly put, as described above, we may at any time request Calm Seas to purchase shares in excess of such ceiling, either as a part of bi-monthly puts or as an additional put(s) during such month. If Calm Seas, in its sole discretion, accepts such request to purchase additional shares, then we may include the put for additional shares in our monthly put request or submit an additional put for such additional shares in accordance with the procedure set forth above. 

&#160; 

The Letter Agreement will terminate when any of the following events occur: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Calm Seas has purchased an aggregate of $7,500,000 of our Class A common stock; or 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

The second anniversary from the Effective Date. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, 26,242,772 shares of common stock were issued pursuant to the Letter Agreement. 

&#160; 

On June 22, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with a consultant pursuant to which the consultant would provide investor relations services. The agreement commenced on June 22, 2015 and continued until December 16, 2015. As agreed in the agreement and as a consideration for the services performed, on June 22, 2015, the Company issued the consultant a three year warrant to purchase 15,000,000 shares of common stock which carries a cashless exercise provision with a fair value of $590,335. 

&#160; 

On December 30, 2015, the Company entered into a cooperative agreement for the research and pilot production of hybrid silkworms in Vietnam. Under this agreement the Company will establish a subsidiary in Vietnam where it will develop and produce hybrid silkworms. As of December 31, 2015, the subsidiary was not yet established and no work has been performed in Vietnam for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company delayed the announcement of this agreement until late in February, 2016. This additional time was used to confirm this agreement with higher level authorities and outside review. 

&#160; 

The Market 

&#160; 

We are focusing our work on the creation of new fibers with unique properties including fibers with potential high performance and technical fiber applications. The performance fiber market is exemplified by two classes of product: aramid fibers, and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber. These products service the need for materials with high strength, resilience, and flexibility. Because these synthetic performance fibers are stronger and tougher than steel, they are used in a wide variety of military, industrial, and consumer applications. 

&#160; 

Among the users of performance fibers are the military and police, which employ them for ballistic protection. The materials are also used for industrial applications requiring superior strength and toughness, i.e. critical cables and abrasion/impact resistant components. Performance fibers are also employed in safety equipment, high strength composite materials for the aero-space industry and for ballistic protection by the defense industry. 

&#160; 

The global market for technical textiles has been estimated at greater than $133 billion. 1 

&#160; 

These are industrial materials which have become essential products for both industrial and consumer applications. The market for technical textiles can be defined as consisting of: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Medical textiles; 

&#9679; 

Geotextiles; 

&#9679; 

Textiles used in Defense and Military; 

&#9679; 

Safe and Protective Clothing; 

&#9679; 

Filtration Textiles; 

&#9679; 

Textiles used in Transportation; 

&#9679; 

Textiles used in Buildings; 

&#9679; 

Composites with Textile Structure; 

&#9679; 

Functional and Sportive Textiles. 

&#160; 

We believe that the superior mechanical characteristics of the next generation of protein-based polymers (in other words, genetically engineered silk fibers), will open up new applications for the technology. The materials which we are working to produce are many times tougher and stronger than steel. These fibers are often referred to as &#8220;super fibers.&#8221;

&#160; 

This comparison table was the result of research performed by Randolph Lewis, Ph.D. at the University of Wyoming. Such work was summarized in an article entitled &#8220;Spider Silk: Ancient Ideas for New Biomaterials&#8221; which was published in Chemicals Review, volume 106, issue 9, pages 3672 &#8211; 3774. The measurements in joules in the table above are a conversion from Dr. Lewis&#8217; measurements in newtons/meter squared. 

&#160; 

We believe that the genetically engineered protein-based fibers we seek to produce have properties that are in some ways superior to the materials currently available in the marketplace. For example, as noted above, the ability of spider silk to absorb in excess of 100,000 joules of kinetic energy per kilogram makes it a potentially ideal material for structural blast protection. 

&#160; 

Production of this material in commercial quantities holds the potential of a life-saving ballistic resistant material, which is lighter, thinner, more flexible, and tougher than steel. Other applications for spider silk based recombinant fibers include use as structural material and for any application in which light weight and high strength are required. We believe that fibers made with recombinant protein-based polymers will make significant inroads into the specialty fiber and technical textile markets. 

&#160; 

While the properties of spider silks are well known, there was no known way to produce these fibers in commercial quantity. The spiders are cannibalistic, and cannot be raised in concentrated colonies. 

&#160; 

Our Technology 

&#160; 

While scientists have been able to replicate the proteins that are the building blocks of spider silk, the technological barrier that has stymied production until now has been the inability to form these proteins into a fiber with the desired mechanical characteristics and to do so in a cost effective manner. 

&#160; 

We have licensed the right to use the patented genetic sequences and genetic engineering technology developed in university laboratories. The Company has been working collaboratively with university laboratories to develop fibers with the mechanical characteristics of spider silk. We are applying this proprietary genetic engineering technology to domesticated silkworms, which are already the most efficient commercial producers of silk. 

&#160; 

Our technology builds upon the unique advantages of the domesticated silkworm for this application. The silkworm is ideally suited to produce recombinant protein fiber because it is already an efficient commercial and industrial producer of protein based polymers. Forty percent (40%) of the caterpillars&#8217; weight is devoted to the silk glands. The silk glands produce large volumes of protein, called fibroin, which are then spun into a composite protein thread (silk). 

&#160; 

We are working to use our genetic engineering technology to create recombinant silk polymers. On September 29, 2010, we jointly announced with the University of Notre Dame the success of our collaborative research with Notre Dame in creating approximately twenty different strains of transgenic silkworm which produce recombinant silk polymers. In April 2011, we entered into a licensing agreement with Sigma-Aldrich which provides us the use of Sigma-Aldrich&#8217;s zinc finger technology to accelerate and enhance our product development. 

&#160; 

A part of our intellectual property portfolio is the exclusive right to use certain patented spider silk gene sequences in silkworm. Under the Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Wyoming, we have obtained certain exclusive rights to use numerous genetic sequences which are the subject of US patents. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The introduction of the gene sequence, in the manner employed by us, results in a germline transformation and is therefore self-perpetuating. This technology is in essence a protein expression platform which has other potential applications including diagnostics and pharmaceutical production. 

&#160; &#160; 

The Company 

&#160; 

Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. (Kraig) is a Wyoming corporation. Our shares are traded on the OTCQB under the ticker symbol: KBLB . There are 719,110,271 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of March 30, 2016. Kim Thompson, our founder and CEO, owns approximately 34.3% of the issued and outstanding common shares. There are 2 shares of super voting preferred stock issued and outstanding as of March 30, 2016, all of which Kim Thompson owns. 

&#160; 

The inventor of our technology concept, Kim Thompson, is the founder of Kraig Biocraft Laboratories, Inc. Our protein expression system is, in concept, scalable, cost effective, and capable of producing a wide range of proteins and materials. 

&#160; 

On April 8, 2011, Kraig and Sigma-Aldrich Co., an Illinois corporation (&#8220;Sigma&#8221;) entered into a License and Option Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Sigma will provide Kraig with its proprietary genetic engineering tools and expertise in zinc finger nuclease to enable Kraig to significantly accelerate its product development. In addition to providing the customized tools and technological know-how, Sigma has granted Kraig an option for a commercial license to use the technology in the textile, technical textile and biomedical markets. Sigma will create customized zinc fingers for Kraig's use in its development of spider silk polymers and technical textiles. 

&#160; 

In September 2010, the Company announced that it had succeeded in introducing spider silk DNA in silkworm with the result that the transgenic silkworm were producing new recombinant silk fibers. These fibers are a combination of natural silkworm silk proteins and proteins that the silkworms are making as a result of the introduction of the spider silk DNA. The Company announced that it had created approximately twenty different transgenic silkworm strains producing recombinant silk. 

&#160; 

We entered into an intellectual property and collaborative research agreement with the University of Notre Dame in 2007. That agreement was subsequently extended and expanded to include research and development of certain platform technologies with potential applications for diagnostics and pharmaceutical production. On March 20, 2010, the Company extended its agreement with Notre Dame through February 28, 2011 . Pursuant to these agreements the genetic work has been conducted primarily within Notre Dame&#8217;s laboratories. In June 2012, we entered into the Intellectual Property / Collaborative Research Agreement with Notre Dame (&#8220;2012 Notre Dame Research Agreement&#8221;). On March 4, 2015 we entered into a new Intellectual Property / Collaborative Research Agreement with University of Notre Dame extending the agreement through March 2016 (&#8220;2015 Notre Dame Research Agreement&#8221;). Under the 2015 Notre Dame Research agreement the Company will provide approximately $534,000 in financial support. On September 20, 2015 this agreement was amended to increase the total funding by approximately $179,000. In February 2016 this agreement was extended to July 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, the Company paid $ $432,008and $439,536 in research and development fees. 

&#160; 

We also entered into an intellectual property and sponsored research agreement with the University of Wyoming in 2006. 

&#160; 

License Agreements/Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We have obtained certain rights to use a number of university created, and patented, spider silk proteins, gene sequences and methodologies. 

&#160; 

Between 2010 and 2014 the University of Notre Dame filed approximately 12 patent applications pursuant to our intellectual property and collaborative research agreement. Under the terms of that agreement the Company has an option for the exclusive commercial rights to that technology. The Company has notified the University of its exercise of that option. These patent applications include coverage in the United States, Europe, Korea, Vietnam, Brazil, India, China, Australia, Japan, and Canada. As of the date hereof, all of these patents were pending applications and none have been issued. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We do not own any patents. In 2014, seven trademarks were issued to the Company which it intends to use for product branding in the future. The details of such trademarks are set forth in the following table:

License Agreement with Notre Dame University 

&#160; 

In 2011, the Company exercised its option to obtain the global commercialization rights to the technology developed under the collaborative research agreements with Notre Dame. On October 28, 2011, the Company entered into a license agreement with the University of Notre Dame. Under the agreement, the Company received exclusive and non-exclusive rights to certain spider silk technologies including commercial rights with the right to sublicense such intellectual property. 

&#160; 

In consideration of the licenses granted under the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to the University of Notre Dame 2,200,000 shares of its common stock and to pay a royalty of 2% of net sales. 

&#160; 

The Agreement has a term of 20 years which can be extended on an annual basis after that. It can be terminated by the University of Notre Dame if the Company defaults on its obligations under the Agreement and fails to cure such default within 90 days of a written notice by the university. The Company can terminate the Agreement upon a 90 day written notice subject to payment of a termination fee of $5,000 if the termination takes place within 2 years after its effectiveness, $10,000 if the termination takes place within 4 years after its effectiveness, and $20,000 if the Agreement is terminated after 4 years. 

&#160; 

Exclusive License Agreement with University of Wyoming 

&#160; 

In May 2006, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Wyoming, pursuant to which we have licensed the right to commercialize the production by silkworms of certain synthetic and natural spider silk proteins and the genetic sequencing for such spider silk proteins. These spider silk proteins and genetic sequencing are covered by patents held by the University of Wyoming. Our license allows us only to use silkworms to produce the licensed proteins and genetic sequencing. We have the right to sublicense the intellectual property that we license from the University of Wyoming. Our license agreement with the University of Wyoming requires that we pay licensing and research fees to the university in exchange for an exclusive license in our field of use for certain university-developed intellectual property including patented spider silk gene sequences. Pursuant to the agreement, we issued 17,500,000 shares of our Class A common stock to the University Foundation. Our license agreement with the University of Wyoming will continue until the later of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire patent we license from the University of Wyoming under this license agreement in such country or (ii) ten years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country. There are no royalties payable to the University of Wyoming under the terms of our agreement with them. 

&#160; 

We anticipate making arrangements with the University of Wyoming within the next twelve months to address accrued feeds. If we fail to make such arrangements the University of Wyoming could terminate our license agreement. We anticipate that such a termination would result in a loss of three to nine months of research time and result in increased research and development costs in the range of $30,000 to $140,000. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

On September 29, 2010 we announced that we had achieved our longstanding goal of producing new silk fibers composed of recombinant proteins. The Company intends to turn our technology to the development and production of high performance polymers . 

&#160; 

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have spent approximately 7,000 hours and 7,000 hours, respectively, on research and development activities, which consisted primarily of laboratory research on genetic engineering by our outside consultants pursuant to our collaborative research agreement with the University of Notre Dame. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2015 we had two (2) employees including Kim Thompson, our sole officer and director and Jon Rice, our Chief Operating Officer. In January 2015, we appointed Mr. Jonathan R. Rice as our Chief Operating Officer. We plan to hire more persons on as-needed basis. 

&#160;
