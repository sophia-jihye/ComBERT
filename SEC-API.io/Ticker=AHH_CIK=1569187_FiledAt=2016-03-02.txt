Our third-party construction contracts have included signature properties across the Mid-Atlantic region, such as the Inner Harbor East development in Baltimore, Maryland, including the Four Seasons Hotel and Legg Mason office tower, the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Washington, D.C., and a $50 million proton therapy institute for Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia. Our construction company historically has been ranked among the &#8220;Top 400 General Contractors&#8221; nationwide by Engineering News Record and has been ranked among the &#8220;Top 50 Retail Contractors&#8221; by Shopping Center World.

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other REITs through the following competitive strengths: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

High-Quality, Diversified Portfolio . Our portfolio consists of institutional-grade, premier office, retail and multifamily properties located primarily in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina. Our properties are generally in the top tier of commercial properties in their markets and offer Class-A amenities and finishes. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Seasoned, Committed and Aligned Senior Management Team with a Proven Track Record. &#160; Our senior management team has extensive experience developing, constructing, owning, operating, renovating and financing institutional-grade office, retail, multifamily and hotel properties in the Mid-Atlantic region. As of December 31, 2015, our executive officers and directors collectively owned approximately 21% of our company on a fully diluted basis, which we believe aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Strategic Focus on Attractive Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern Markets. &#160; We focus our activities in our target markets in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern region s of the United States that demonstrate attractive fundamentals driven by favorable supply and demand characteristics and limited competition from other large, well-capitalized operators. We believe that our longstanding presence in our target markets provides us with significant advantages in sourcing and executing development opportunities, identifying and mitigating potential risks and negotiating attractive pricing. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Extensive Experience with Construction and Development. &#160; Our platform consists of development, construction and asset management capabilities, which comprise an integrated delivery system for every project that we build for our own account or for third-party clients. This integrated approach provides a single source of accountability for design and construction, simplifies coordination and communication among the relevant stakeholders in each project and provides us valuable insight from an operational perspective. We believe that being regularly engaged in construction and development projects provides us significant and distinct advantages, including enhanced market intelligence, greater insight into best practices, enhanced operating leverage and &#8220;first look&#8221; access to development and ownership opportunities in our target markets. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Longstanding Public and Private Relationships . We have extensive experience with public/private real estate development projects dating back to 1984, having worked with the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Georgia and the Kingdom of Sweden, as well as various municipalities. Through our experience and longstanding relationships with governmental entities such as these, we have learned to successfully navigate the often complex and time-consuming government approval process, which has given us the ability to capture opportunities that we believe many of our competitors are unable to pursue. &#160; 

&#160; 

Our Business and Growth Strategies 

&#160; 

Our primary business objectives are to: (i) continue to develop, build and own institutional-grade office, retail and multifamily properties in our target markets, (ii) finance and operate our portfolio in a manner that increases cash flow and property values, (iii) execute new third-party construction work with consistent operating margins and (iv) pursue 

&#160;

selective acquisition opportunities, particularly when the acquisition involves a significant redevelopment aspect. We will seek to achieve our objectives through the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Pursue a Disciplined, Opportunistic Development and Acquisition Strategy Focused on Office, Retail and Multifamily Properties . We intend to grow our asset base through continued strategic development of office, retail and multifamily properties, and the selective acquisition of high-quality properties that are well-located in their submarkets. Furthermore, we believe our construction and development expertise provides a high level of quality control while ensuring that the projects we construct and develop are completed more quickly and at a lower cost than if we engaged a third-party general contractor. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Pursue New, and Expand Existing, Public/Private Relationships . We intend to leverage our extensive experience in completing large, complex, mixed-use, public/private projects to establish relationships with new public partners while expanding our relationships with existing public partners. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leverage our Construction and Development Platform to Attract Additional Third-Party Clients . We believe that we have a unique advantage over many of our competitors due to our integrated construction and development business that provides expertise, oversight and a broad array of client-focused services. We intend to continue to conduct and grow our construction business and other third-party services by pursuing new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Engage in Disciplined Capital Recycling . We intend to opportunistically divest properties when we believe returns have been maximized and to redeploy the capital into new development, acquisition, repositioning or redevelopment projects that are expected to generate higher potential risk-adjusted returns. 

&#160;

The net rentable square footage for each of our office properties is the sum of (a) the square footage of existing leases, plus (b) for available space, management&#8217;s estimate of net rentable square footage based, in part, on past leases. The net rentable square footage included in office leases is generally consistent with the Building Owners and Managers Association, or BOMA, 1996 measurement guidelines. The net rentable square footage for each of our retail properties is the sum of (a) the square footage of existing leases, plus (b) for available space, the field verified square footage. 

(2) 

Occupancy for each of our office and retail properties is calculated as (a) square footage under executed leases as of December 31, 2015 divided by (b) net rentable square feet, expressed as a percentage. Occupancy for our multifamily properties is calculated as (a) total units occupied as of December 31, 2015 divided by (b) total units available, expressed as a percentage. 

(3) 

For the properties in our office and retail portfolios, annualized base rent, or ABR, is calculated by multiplying (a) base rental payments for executed leases as of December 31, 2015 (defined as cash base rents (before abatements) excluding tenant reimbursements for expenses paid by the landlord) by (b) 12. ABR per leased square foot is calculated by dividing (a) ABR by (b) square footage under executed leases as of December 31, 2015. In the case of triple net or modified gross leases, ABR does not include tenant reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, common area or other operating expenses. 

(4) 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company occupied 18,984 square feet at this property at an ABR of $559,294, or $29.46 per leased square foot, which amounts are reflected in the occupancy, ABR and ABR per leased square foot columns in the table. The rent paid by us is eliminated from our revenues in consolidation in accordance with GAAP. In addition, effective March 1, 2013, the Company subleases approximately 5,000 square feet of space from a tenant at this property. 

(5) 

Sold on January 8, 2016. 

(6)

The rent paid by us is eliminated from our revenues in consolidation in accordance with GAAP. 

(7)

The Company owns the land and the tenant owns the improvements thereto. The Company will succeed to the ownership of the improvements to the land upon the termination of the ground lease. 

(9) 

The Company leases the land underlying this property from the owner of the land pursuant to a ground lease. The Company re-leases the land to our tenant under a separate ground lease pursuant to which our tenant owns the improvements on the land. 

(10) 

For the properties in our multifamily portfolio, ABR is calculated by multiplying (a) base rental payments for the month ended December 31, 2015 by (b) 12. 

(11) 

ABR per occupied rentable square foot is calculated by dividing (a) ABR by (b) net rentable square footage of occupied units as of December 31, 2015. 

(12)

BDG is responsible for securing a senior construction loan of up to $70.0 million to fund the development and construction of Point Street Apartments. We have agreed to guarantee up to $25.0 million of the senior construction loan in exchange for the option to purchase up to an 88% controlling interest in Point Street Apartments upon completion of the project as follows: (i) an option to purchase a 79% indirect interest in Point Street Apartments for $27.3 million, exercisable within one year from the project&#8217;s completion (the &#8220;First Option&#8221;) and (ii) provided that we have exercised the First Option, an option to purchase an additional 9% indirect interest in Point Street Apartments for $3.1 million, exercisable within 27 months from the project&#8217;s completion (the &#8220;Second Option&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Our investment in the Point Street Apartments project is in the form of a loan under which BDG may borrow up to $23.0 million (the &#8220;BDG loan&#8221;). Interest on the BDG loan accrues at 8.0% per annum and matures on the earlier of: (i) November 1, 2018, which may be extended by BDG under two one-year extension options, (ii) the maturity date or earlier termination of the senior construction loan or (iii) the date we exercise the Second Option as described further below. 

&#160; 

In the event we exercise the First Option, BDG is required to simultaneously pay down the senior construction loan by $7.4 million and the BDG loan by $19.9 million, at which time the interest rate on the BDG loan will automatically be reduced to the interest rate on the senior construction loan plus 200 basis points. In the event we exercise the Second Option, BDG is required to simultaneously repay any remaining amounts outstanding under the BDG loan, with any excess proceeds received from the exercise of the Second Option applied against the senior construction loan. In the event we do not exercise either the First Option or the Second Option, the interest rate on the BDG loan will automatically be reduced to the interest rate on the senior construction loan for the remaining term of the BDG loan. In the event BDG is unable to secure a senior construction loan on or before June 30, 2016, the interest rate on the BDG loan will be reduced to one-month LIBOR plus 200 basis points. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had funded $7.8 million under the BDG loan and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we had earned $0.1 million of interest income on the BDG loan. 

&#160; 

One City Center 

&#160; 

On February 25, 2016, we announced our joint venture with Austin Lawrence Partners to develop and construct One City Center in Durham, North Carolina. One City Center is a planned 27-story mixed-use project that is expected to include 130,000 square feet of office space, anchored by a 55,000 square foot lease with Duke University, along with 22,000 square feet of street-level retail space and 139 residential units. We are a minority partner in the joint venture and will serve as the project's general contractor. Our anticipated equity investment in the joint venture is approximately $8.6 million. The project is scheduled to be completed in mid-2018. 

&#160; 

Acquisitions and Dispositions 

&#160; 

On January 5, 2015, we sold the Sentara Williamsburg medical office building for $15.4 million in cash and used the net proceeds to partially fund our acquisition of Stone House Square. On April 8, 2015, we acquired Perry Hall Marketplace and Stone House Square, two grocery store anchored retail centers in Maryland, for $35.4 million of cash and 415,500 shares of common stock. 

&#160; 

On February 13, 2015, we agreed to the future sale of the Oyster Point office property for $6.5 million in cash. We intend to complete the sale on January 15, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. 

&#160; 

On May 20, 2015, we sold Whetstone Apartments for $35.6 million and used the net proceeds to partially fund our acquisitions of Socastee Commons and Providence Plaza. On July 1, 2015, we acquired Socastee Commons, a 57,000 square foot grocery store anchored retail center in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for $8.7 million, including the assumption of $5.0 million of debt. On September 1, 2015, we acquired Providence Plaza, a mixed-use 103,000 square foot property in Charlotte, North Carolina for $26.2 million of cash. 

&#160; 

On July 10, 2015, we acquired Columbus Village, a 65,000 square foot retail center adjacent to the Town Center of Virginia Beach, Virginia in exchange for the assumption of $8.8 million of debt, the issuance of 1,000,000 Class B units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (&#8220;Class B Units&#8221;) and the agreement to issue 275,000 Class C units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (Class C Units) on January 10, 2017. See Note 

&#160;

5 and Note 10 to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information regarding the Class B Units and Class C Units. 

&#160; 

On October 30, 2015, we sold the Oceaneering International build-to-suit building for $30.0 million and on January 8, 2016, we sold the Richmond Tower office building for $78.0 million. We used the net proceeds from the Oceaneering and Richmond Tower sales to partially fund our acquisition of a $170.5 million retail portfolio totaling 1.1 million square feet across 11 assets located in the Mid-Atlantic and South-Central United States. We completed the retail portfolio acquisition on January 14, 2016.

Additional information regarding our real estate acquisition and disposition activity is set forth in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and in Note 5 to our consolidated and combined financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. &#160; 

&#160; 

Segments 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we operated in four business segments: (i) office real estate, (ii) retail real estate, (iii) multifamily residential real estate and (iv) general contracting and real estate services. Additional information regarding our four operating segments is set forth in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and in Note 3 to our consolidated and combined financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. &#160; 

&#160; 

Tax Status 

&#160; 

We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Our continued qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and that our manner of operation will enable us to maintain the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, we have elected to treat AHP Holding, Inc., which, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, operate our construction, development and third-party asset management businesses, as a taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;). 

&#160; 

As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. Under the Code, REITs are subject to numerous organizational and operational 

&#160;

requirements, including a requirement that they distribute each year at least 90% of their REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gains. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to state and local taxes on our income and assets and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. Additionally, any income earned by our services company, and any other TRS we form in the future, will be fully subject to federal, state and local corporate income tax. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy, in addition to other coverage that may be appropriate for certain of our properties. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate for our properties given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover our losses. We do not carry insurance for certain losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by riots or war. Some of our policies, like those covering losses due to terrorism and earthquakes, are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co-payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses, for such events. In addition, all of the properties in our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 we re located in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina, which are areas subject to an increased risk of hurricanes. While we will carry hurricane insurance on certain of our properties, the amount of our hurricane insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses from hurricanes. We may reduce or discontinue hurricane, terrorism or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies exceeds, in our judgment, the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss. Also, if destroyed, we may not be able to rebuild certain of our properties due to current zoning and land use regulations. As a result, we may be required to incur significant costs in the event of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters. In addition, our title insurance policies may not insure for the current aggregate market value of our portfolio, and we do not intend to increase our title insurance coverage as the market value of our portfolio increases. If we or one or more of our tenants experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties. In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable costs in the future as the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated. &#160; 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of the properties in our portfolio has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business. 

&#160; 

Americans With Disabilities Act 

&#160; 

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;), to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; as defined by the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Although we believe that the properties in our portfolio in the aggregate substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted a comprehensive audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance, and we are aware that some particular properties may currently be in non-compliance with the ADA. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the incurrence of additional costs to attain compliance, the imposition of fines, an award of damages to private litigants and a limitation on our ability to refinance outstanding indebtedness. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under, or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines, or other costs could exceed the value of the property and our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. 

&#160; 

Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products, propane or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our properties were used in the past for commercial or industrial purposes, or are currently used for commercial purposes, that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. As a result, some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from the releases of such hazardous substances or petroleum products. Where we have deemed appropriate, we have taken steps to address identified contamination or mitigate risks associated with such contamination; however, we are unable to ensure that further actions will not be necessary. As a result of the foregoing, we could potentially incur material liability. 

&#160; 

Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing building materials, or ACBM, and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability. Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing ACBM (and employers in such buildings) properly manage and maintain the asbestos, adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with asbestos, and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. In addition, the presence of ACBM in our properties may expose us to third-party liability (e.g. liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos). We are not presently aware of any material adverse issues at our properties including ACBM. 

&#160; 

Similarly, environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance and removal of lead-based paint in residential buildings, and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements. Such laws require, among other things, that owners or operators of residential facilities that contain or potentially contain lead-based paint notify residents of the presence or potential presence of lead-based paint prior to occupancy and prior to renovations and manage lead-based paint waste appropriately. In addition, the presence of lead-based paint in our buildings may expose us to third-party liability (e.g., liability for personal injury associated with exposure to lead-based paint). We are not presently aware of any material adverse issues at our properties involving lead-based paint. 

&#160; 

In addition, the properties in our portfolio also are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety requirements, such as state and local fire requirements. Moreover, some of our tenants may handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant&#8217;s ability to make rental payments to us. In addition, changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. Our leases sometimes require our tenants to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. But in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy such obligations, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. In addition, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or waste and irrespective of tenant lease provisions. The costs associated with such liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

&#160;

When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of office, retail and multifamily real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located and some of which have greater financial resources than we do. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates, security, flexibility and expertise to design space to meet prospective tenants&#8217; needs and the manner in which the property is operated, maintained and marketed. As leases at our properties expire, we may encounter significant competition to renew or re-lease space in light of the large number of competing properties within the markets in which we operate. As a result, we may be required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for tenant improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or below-market renewal options, or we may not be able to timely lease vacant space. 

&#160; 

We also face competition when pursuing development and acquisition opportunities. Our competitors may be able to pay higher property acquisition prices, may have private access to opportunities not available to us and otherwise be in a better position to acquire or develop a property. Competition may also have the effect of reducing the number of suitable development and acquisition opportunities available to us or increasing the price required to consummate a development or acquisition opportunity. 

&#160; 

In addition, we face competition in our construction business from other construction companies in the markets in which we operate, including small local companies and large regional and national companies. In our construction business, we compete for construction projects based on several factors, including cost, reputation for quality and timeliness, access to machinery and equipment, access to and relationships with high-quality subcontractors, financial strength, knowledge of local markets and project management abilities. We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors, and that our construction business is well-positioned to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate. However, some of the construction companies with which we compete have different cost structures and greater financial and other resources than we do, which may put them at an advantage when competing with us for construction projects. Competition from other construction companies may reduce the number of construction projects that we are hired to complete and increase pricing pressure, either of which could reduce the profitability of our construction business. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

A s &#160; of December 31, 201 5, we had 139 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 

&#160;
