 Item 1. Business 

General 

EnLink Midstream, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2013. Effective as of March 7, 2014, EnLink Midstream, Inc. (&#8220;EMI&#8221;) merged with and into a subsidiary wholly owned by us, and Acacia Natural Gas Corp I, Inc. (&#8220;Acacia&#8221;), formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Devon Energy Corporation (&#8220;Devon&#8221;), merged with and into another subsidiary wholly owned by us (collectively, the &#8220;mergers&#8221;). Pursuant to the mergers, each of EMI and Acacia became our wholly-owned subsidiaries and we became publicly held. EMI owns common units representing an approximate 6.1% &#32;limited partner interest in EnLink Midstream Partners, LP (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and also owns EnLink Midstream Partners GP, LLC, the general partner of the Partnership (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;). At the conclusion of the mergers, Acacia directly owned a 50% limited partner interest in a limited partnership, formerly wholly owned by Devon, that was renamed EnLink Midstream Holdings, LP (&#8220;Midstream Holdings&#8221;). 

Concurrently with the consummation of the mergers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership acquired the remaining 50% of the outstanding limited partner interest in Midstream Holdings and all of the outstanding equity interests in EnLink Midstream Holdings GP, LLC, the general partner of Midstream Holdings (together with the mergers, the &#8220;business combination&#8221;). 

On February 17, 2015, Acacia contributed a 25% interest in Midstream Holdings (the &#8220;February Transferred Interests&#8221;) to the Partnership in a drop down transaction (the &#8220;February EMH Drop Down&#8221;) in exchange for 31.6 million units in the Partnership, representing an approximate 9.5% &#32;limited partner interest in the Partnership as of December 31, 2015. On May 27, 2015, Acacia contributed the remaining 25% limited partner interest in Midstream Holdings (the &#8220;May Transferred Interests&#8221;) to the Partnership in a drop down transaction (the &#8220;May EMH Drop Down&#8221; and together with the February EMH Drop Down, the &#8220;EMH Drop Downs&#8221;) in exchange for 36.6 million units in the Partnership, representing an approximate 11.0% &#32;limited partner interest in the Partnership as of December 31, 2015. After giving effect to the EMH Drop Downs, the Partnership owns 100% of Midstream Holdings. 

Our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;ENLC.&#8221; Our executive offices are located at 2501 Cedar Springs Rd., Dallas, Texas 75201, and our telephone number is (214) 953-9500.

ENLINK MIDSTREAM, LLC 

Our assets consist of equity interests in the Partnership and TOM Holdings. The Partnership is a publicly traded limited partnership engaged in the gathering, transmission, processing and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids, or NGLs, condensate and crude oil, as well as providing crude oil, condensate and brine services to producers. As of December 31, 2015, our interests in the Partnership consist of the following: 

&#8226; 

88,528,451 &#32;common units representing an aggregate 26.5% &#32;limited partner interest in the Partnership; and 

&#8226; 

100.0% &#32;ownership interest in the General Partner, which owns a 0.5% &#32;general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in the Partnership. 

The Partnership is required by its partnership agreement to distribute all its cash on hand at the end of each quarter, less reserves established by the General Partner in its sole discretion to provide for the proper conduct of the Partnership&#8217;s business, as applicable, or to provide for future distributions. 

The incentive distribution rights in the Partnership entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the Partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached. Specifically, they entitle us to receive 13.0% of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received $0.25 for that quarter, 23.0% of all cash distributed after each unit has received $0.3125 for that quarter and 48.0% of all cash distributed after each unit has received $0.375 for that quarter. 

We intend to pay distributions to our unitholders on a quarterly basis equal to the cash we receive, if any, from distributions from the Partnership less reserves for expenses, future distributions and other uses of cash, including: 

&#8226; 

federal income taxes, which we are required to pay because we are taxed as a corporation; 

&#8226; 

the expenses of being a public company; 

&#8226; 

other general and administrative expenses; 

&#8226; 

capital calls for our interest in Tall Oaks to the extent not covered by our borrowings; 

&#8226; 

capital contributions to the Partnership upon the issuance by it of additional partnership securities in order to maintain the General Partner&#8217;s then-current general partner interest, to the extent the board of directors of the General Partner (the &#8220;GP Board&#8221;) exercises its option to do so; and 

&#8226; 

cash reserves the board of directors of EnLink Midstream Manager, LLC, our managing member (the &#8220;Managing Member&#8221;), believes are prudent to maintain. 

Our ability to pay distributions is limited by the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, which provides that a limited liability company may not pay distributions if, after giving effect to the distribution, the company&#8217;s liabilities would exceed the fair value of its assets. While our ownership of equity interests in the General Partner and the Partnership are included in our calculation of net assets, the value of these assets may decline to a level where our liabilities would exceed the fair value of our assets if we were to pay distributions, thus prohibiting us from paying distributions under Delaware law.

Our Operations 

The Partnership primarily focuses on providing midstream energy services, including gathering, transmission, processing, fractionation, brine services and marketing, to producers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate. The Partnership's midstream energy asset network includes approximately 9,400 &#32;miles of pipelines, 16 &#32;natural gas processing plants, seven &#32;fractionators, 3.2 &#32;million barrels of NGL cavern storage, 19.1 &#32;Bcf of natural gas storage, rail terminals, barge terminals, truck terminals and a fleet of approximately 150 &#32;trucks. The Partnership's operations are based in the United States and its sales are derived from external domestic customers. 

The Partnership connects the wells of natural gas producers in its market areas to its gathering systems, processes natural gas for the removal of NGLs, fractionate NGLs into purity products and markets those products for a fee, transports natural gas and ultimately provides natural gas to a variety of markets. The Partnership purchases natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply sources and sells that natural gas to utilities, industrial consumers, other marketers and pipelines. The Partnership operates processing plants that process gas transported to the plants by major interstate pipelines or from its own gathering systems under a variety of fee-based arrangements. The Partnership provides a variety of crude oil and condensate services, which include crude oil and condensate gathering via pipelines, barges, rail and trucks, condensate stabilization and brine disposal. The Partnership's gas gathering systems consist of networks of pipelines that collect natural gas from points near producing wells and transport it to larger pipelines for further transmission. The Partnership's transmission pipelines primarily receive natural gas from its gathering systems and from third party gathering and transmission systems and deliver natural gas to industrial end-users, utilities and other pipelines. The Partnership also has transmission lines that transport NGLs from east Texas and from its south Louisiana processing plants to its fractionators in south Louisiana. Additionally, the Partnership owns an economic interest in an NGL fractionator located at Mont Belvieu, Texas that receives raw mix NGLs from customers, fractionates such raw mix and redelivers the finished products to the customers for a fee. Devon is one of the largest customers of this fractionator. The Partnership's crude oil and condensate gathering and transmission systems consist of trucking facilities, pipelines, rail and barge facilities that, in exchange for a fee, transport oil from a producer site to an end user. The Partnership's processing plants remove NGLs and CO2 from a natural gas stream and its fractionators separate the NGLs into separate NGL products, including ethane, propane, iso-butane, normal butane and natural gasoline. 

The Partnership's assets are included in five primary segments: 

&#8226; 

Texas . The Partnership's Texas assets consist of transmission pipelines with a capacity of approximately 1.3 Bcf/d, processing facilities with a total processing capacity of approximately 1.4 Bcf/d and gathering systems with total capacity of approximately 2.9 Bcf/d. 

&#8226; 

Oklahoma. The Partnership's Oklahoma assets consist of processing facilities with a total processing capacity of approximately 550 MMcf/d and gathering systems with total capacity of approximately 605 MMcf/d (excluding the Oklahoma assets acquired in January 2016 discussed in Recent Growth Developments below). 

&#8226; 

Louisiana. The Partnership's Louisiana assets consist of Louisiana Gas and Processing assets which include transmission pipelines with a capacity of approximately 3.5 Bcf/d, processing facilities with a total processing capacity of approximately 1.7 Bcf/d and gathering systems with total capacity of approximately 510 MMcf/d. The Partnership's Louisiana Liquids assets consists of 660 miles of liquids transport lines and four fractionation assets with total fractionation capacity of 198 MBbls/d. 

&#8226; 

Crude and Condensate. The Partnership's Crude and Condensate assets consist of approximately 350 miles of crude oil and condensate pipelines. The assets also include 900,000 barrels of above ground storage and a trucking fleet of approximately 150 vehicles comprised of both semi and straight trucks with a current capacity of 85,350 Bbls/d. The current pipeline capacity is 101,100 Bbls/d. Additionally, the Partnership's operations include eight condensate stabilization and natural gas compression stations with combined capacities of over 36,000 Bbls/d of condensate stabilization and 780 MMcf/d of natural gas compression. 

&#8226; 

Corporate . The Partnership's Corporate assets consist of a contractual right to the benefits and burdens associated with Devon's 38.75% ownership interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators (&#8220;GCF&#8221;) and a 30.6% ownership interest in Howard Energy Partners (&#8220;HEP&#8221;). 

About Devon 

Devon (NYSE: DVN) is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development and production of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. Devon&#8217;s operations are concentrated in various onshore areas in the U.S. and Canada. Please see Devon&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for additional information concerning Devon&#8217;s business. 

Our Business Strategies 

Our primary business objective is to provide cash flow stability in our distributions while growing our business prudently and profitably. We intend to accomplish this objective by having the Partnership execute the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Maintain stable cash flows supported by long-term, fee-based contracts. The Partnership will seek to generate cash flows pursuant to long-term, firm contracts with creditworthy customers. The Partnership will continue to pursue opportunities to increase the fee-based and minimum volume commitment components of its contract portfolio to minimize its direct commodity price exposure. 

&#8226; 

Maintain strong financial position. The Partnership believes that maintaining a conservative and balanced capital structure and appropriate leverage and other key financial metrics will afford it better access to the capital markets at a competitive cost of capital. The Partnership also believes a strong financial position provides it the opportunity to grow its business in a prudent manner through the cycles in its industry. 

&#8226; 

Execute in our core areas. The Partnership &#32; believes its assets are positioned in some of the most economic basins in the U.S. as well as key demand centers with growing end-use customers. &#32; The Partnership expects to grow certain of its systems organically over time by meeting Devon&#8217;s and its other customers&#8217; midstream service needs that result from its drilling activity in the Partnership's areas of operation. The Partnership continually evaluates whether to pursue economically attractive organic expansion opportunities in existing or new areas of operation that allow it to leverage its existing infrastructure, operating expertise and customer relationships by constructing and expanding systems to meet new or increased demand for its services. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that the Partnership is well-positioned to execute its primary business strategies and to achieve its business objective due to the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

Devon&#8217;s sponsorship . The Partnership expects its relationship with Devon will continue to provide it with significant business opportunities. Devon is one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in North America. Devon has a significant interest in promoting the success of the Partnership's business, due to its approximate 70% ownership interest in us and approximate 28% &#32;ownership interest in the Partnership as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 50% of the Partnership's gross operating margin was attributable to commercial contracts with Devon in 2015. 

&#8226; 

Strategically-located assets . The Partnership's assets are strategically located in strategic producing regions with the potential for increasing throughput volume and cash flow generation. The Partnership's assets are in areas consistent with Devon's strategic focus. The Partnership's asset portfolio includes gathering, transmission, fractionation, processing and stabilization systems that are located in areas in which producer activity is focused on crude oil, condensate and NGLs as well as natural gas. The Partnership has developed or is in the process of developing 

platforms in Oklahoma, in the Permian Basin in Texas and in southern Louisiana through organic development and acquisitions. 

&#8226; 

Stable cash flows . Approximately 96% of the Partnership's combined cash flows were derived from fee-based services with no direct commodity exposure during 2015 . The Partnership currently has approximately eight years remaining on fixed-fee gathering and processing agreements with a subsidiary of Devon pursuant to which the Partnership will provide gathering, treating, compression, dehydration, stabilization, processing and fractionation services, as applicable, for natural gas delivered by Devon to Partnership's gathering and processing systems in the Barnett and Cana-Woodford Shales. These agreements provide the Partnership with dedication of all of the natural gas owned or controlled by Devon and produced from or attributable to existing and future wells located on certain oil, natural gas and mineral leases covering lands within the acreage dedications, excluding properties previously dedicated to other natural gas gathering systems not owned and operated by Devon. These agreements also include minimum volume commitments that will remain in effect for approximately three more years, as well as annual rate escalators with a remaining term of approximately three years. Additionally, the Partnership's recently acquired Tall Oak assets are supported by Devon with acreage dedications and minimum volume commitments for gathering and processing on Devon&#8217;s recently acquired Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties (&#8220;STACK&#8221;) acreage. Please read &#8220;&#8212;Partnership&#8217;s Contractual Relationship with Devon.&#8221; The Partnership will continue to focus on contract structures that reduce volatility and support long-term stability of cash flows. 

&#8226; 

Integrated midstream services. &#32;The Partnership spans the energy value chain by providing natural gas, NGL, crude oil and condensate services across a diverse customer base. These services include gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting, storing and selling natural gas, producing, fractionating, transporting, stabilizing, storing and selling NGLs, and gathering, transporting, storing and trans-loading crude oil and condensate. The Partnership believes its ability to provide all of these services gives it an advantage in competing for new opportunities because it can provide substantially all services that producers, marketers and others require to move natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate from the wellhead to the market on a cost-effective basis. 

&#8226; 

Experienced management team . The Partnership believes its management team has a proven track record of creating value through the development, acquisition, optimization and integration of midstream assets. The Partnership's management team has an average of over 20 years of experience in the energy industry. The Partnership believes this team provides it with a strong foundation for evaluating growth opportunities and operating its assets in a safe, reliable and efficient manner. 

We believe that the Partnership will leverage its competitive strengths to successfully implement its strategy; however, the Partnership's business involves numerous risks and uncertainties that may prevent the Partnership from achieving its primary business objectives. For a more complete description of the risks associated with the Partnership's business, please see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221;

Recent Growth Developments 

Acquisitions 

Tall Oak. On January 7, 2016, we and the Partnership acquired a 16% and 84% interest, respectively, in subsidiaries of Tall Oak for $1.55 billion, subject to certain adjustments (the &#8220;Tall Oak Acquisition&#8221;). The first installment of $1.05 billion for the acquisition was paid at closing and the final installment of $500.0 million is due no later than the first anniversary of the closing date with the option to defer $250.0 million of the final installment up to 24 months following the closing date. 

The first installment consisted of approximately $1.05 billion and was funded by (a) approximately $788.0 million in cash contributed by the Partnership, a portion of which was derived from the proceeds from the issuance of the Preferred Units (as defined under &#8220;Issuance of Preferred Units&#8221; below), and (b) (i) 15,564,009 of our common units issued directly by us and (ii) approximately $19.5 million in cash contributed by us. 

&#32;Tall Oak's assets serve gathering and processing needs in the growing STACK and Central Northern Oklahoma Woodford (&#8220;CNOW&#8221;) plays in Oklahoma and are supported by long-term, fixed-fee contracts with acreage dedications that have a remaining weighted-average term of approximately 15 years.

The Nueva Era Pipeline is a 50-50 joint venture between HEP and Mexico-based energy and services firm Grupo Clisa connecting HEP&#8217;s existing Webb County Hub in South Texas directly to the Mexican National Pipeline System in Monterrey, Mexico. Mexico&#8217;s Comisi&#243;n Federal de Electricidad will be the foundation shipper on the approximately 200-mile, 30-inch Nueva Era Pipeline and will transport 504 MMcf/d on the system for a 25-year term. 

Lobo II Natural Gas Gathering and Processing Facility. In the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership commenced construction of a new cryogenic gas processing plant and a gas gathering system in the Delaware Basin. The plant will initially provide 60 MMcf/d of processing capacity with a potential capacity of 120 MMcf/d and be tied to approximately 75 miles of new pipeline located in both in Texas and New Mexico that is also under construction. The plant and Texas portion of the pipeline are expected to be completed in the second half of 2016 with the remaining New Mexico pipeline to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. The Lobo II system is supported by a long-term contract with an investment grade producer. 

Ohio River Valley Condensate Stabilization Facilities. Through an agreement with Eclipse Resources, the Partnership constructed three natural gas compression and condensate stabilization facilities during late 2014 and 2015 in Harrison, Monroe and Guernsey counties in Ohio. The Partnership will begin construction on the fourth facility as needed based on available volumes. 

Marathon Petroleum Joint Venture. The Partnership has entered into a series of agreements with a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (&#8220;Marathon Petroleum&#8221;) to create a 50/50 joint venture named Ascension Pipeline Company, LLC. This joint venture will build a new 30-mile NGL pipeline connecting the Partnership's existing Riverside fractionation and terminal complex to Marathon Petroleum's Garyville refinery located on the Mississippi River. This bolt-on project to the Partnership's Cajun-Sibon NGL system is supported by long-term, fee-based contracts with Marathon Petroleum. Under the arrangement, the Partnership will serve as the construction manager and operator of the pipeline project, which is expected to be operational in the first half of 2017.

Industry Overview 

The following diagram illustrates the gathering, processing, fractionation, stabilization and transmission process. 

The midstream industry is the link between the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and the delivery of its components to end-user markets. The midstream industry is generally characterized by regional competition based on the proximity of gathering systems and processing plants to natural gas and crude oil and condensate producing wells. 

Natural gas gathering. The natural gas gathering process follows the drilling of wells into gas-bearing rock formations. After a well has been completed, it is connected to a gathering system. Gathering systems typically consist of a network of small diameter pipelines and, if necessary, compression and treating systems that collect natural gas from points near producing wells and transport it to larger pipelines for further transmission. 

Compression. Gathering systems are operated at pressures that will maximize the total natural gas throughput from all connected wells. Because wells produce gas at progressively lower field pressures as they age, it becomes increasingly difficult to deliver the remaining production in the ground against the higher pressure that exists in the connected gathering system. Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which a volume of gas at an existing pressure is compressed to a desired higher pressure, allowing gas that no longer naturally flows into a higher-pressure downstream pipeline to be brought to market. Field compression is typically used to allow a gathering system to operate at a lower pressure or provide sufficient discharge pressure to deliver gas into a higher-pressure downstream pipeline. The remaining natural gas in the ground will not be produced if field compression is not installed because the gas will be unable to overcome the higher gathering system pressure. Also, a declining well can continue delivering natural gas if field compression is installed. 

Natural gas processing. The principal components of natural gas are methane and ethane, but most natural gas also contains varying amounts of heavier NGLs and contaminants, such as water and CO2, sulfur compounds, nitrogen or helium. Natural gas produced by a well may not be suitable for long-haul pipeline transportation or commercial use and may need to be processed to remove the heavier hydrocarbon components and contaminants. Natural gas in commercial distribution systems mostly consists of methane and ethane, and moisture and other contaminants have been removed so there are negligible amounts of them in the gas stream. Natural gas is processed to remove unwanted contaminants that would interfere with pipeline transportation or use of the natural gas and to separate those hydrocarbon liquids from the gas that have higher value as NGLs. The removal and separation of individual hydrocarbons through processing is possible due to differences in weight, 

boiling point, vapor pressure and other physical characteristics. Natural gas processing involves the separation of natural gas into pipeline-quality natural gas and a mixed NGL stream and the removal of contaminants. 

NGL fractionation. NGLs are separated into individual, more valuable components during the fractionation process. NGL fractionation facilities separate mixed NGL streams into discrete NGL products: ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane, natural gasoline and stabilized crude oil and condensate. Ethane is primarily used in the petrochemical industry as feedstock for ethylene, one of the basic building blocks for a wide range of plastics and other chemical products. Propane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and propylene and as a heating fuel, an engine fuel and industrial fuel. Isobutane is used principally to enhance the octane content of motor gasoline. Normal butane is used as a petrochemical feedstock in the production of ethylene and butylene (a key ingredient in synthetic rubber), as a blend stock for motor gasoline and to derive isobutene through isomerization. Natural gasoline, a mixture of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons, is used primarily as motor gasoline blend stock or petrochemical feedstock. 

Natural gas transmission. Natural gas transmission pipelines receive natural gas from mainline transmission pipelines, processing plants and gathering systems and deliver it to industrial end-users, utilities and to other pipelines. 

Crude oil and condensate transmission. Crude oil and condensate are transported by pipelines, barges, rail cars and tank trucks. The method of transportation used depends on, among other things, the resources of the transporter, the locations of the production points and the delivery points, cost-efficiency and the quantity of product being transported. 

Condensate Stabilization . &#32;Condensate stabilization is the distillation of the condensate product to remove the lighter end components, which ultimately creates a higher quality condensate product that is then delivered via truck, rail or pipeline to local markets. 

Brine gathering and disposal services. Typically, shale wells produce significant amounts of water that, in most cases, require disposal. Produced water and frac-flowback is hauled via truck transport or is pumped through pipelines from its origin at the oilfield tank battery or drilling pad to the disposal location. Once the water reaches the delivery disposal location, water is processed and filtered to remove impurities and injection wells place fluids underground for storage and disposal. 

Crude oil and condensate terminals. Crude oil and condensate rail terminals are an integral part of ensuring the movement of new crude oil and condensate production from the developing shale plays in the United States and Canada. In general, the crude oil and condensate rail loading terminals are used to load rail cars and transport the commodity out of developing basins into market rich areas of the country where crude oil and condensate rail unloading terminals are used to unload rail cars and store crude oil and condensate volumes for third parties until the crude oil and condensate is redelivered to premium market delivery points via pipelines, trucks or rail. 

Balancing Supply and Demand 

When the Partnership purchases natural gas, crude oil and condensate, we establish a margin normally by selling it for physical delivery to third-party users. The Partnership can also use over-the-counter derivative instruments or enter into future delivery obligations under futures contracts on the NYMEX related to its natural gas purchases. Through these transactions, the Partnership seeks to maintain a position that is balanced between purchases, on the one hand, and sales or future delivery obligations, on the other hand. The Partnership&#8217;s policy is not to acquire and hold natural gas futures contracts or derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes. 

Competition 

The business of providing gathering, transmission, processing and marketing services for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate is highly competitive. The Partnership faces strong competition in obtaining natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate supplies and in the marketing and transportation of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate, as applicable. Its competitors include major integrated and independent exploration and production companies, natural gas producers, interstate and intrastate pipelines, other natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate gatherers and natural gas processors. Competition for natural gas and crude oil and condensate supplies is primarily based on geographic location of facilities in relation to production or markets, the reputation, efficiency and reliability of the gatherer and the pricing arrangements offered by the gatherer. Competition varies in different geographic areas. 

In marketing natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate the Partnership has numerous competitors, including marketing affiliates of interstate pipelines, major integrated oil and gas companies, and local and national natural gas producers, gatherers, brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience. Local utilities and distributors of natural gas are, in some cases, engaged directly and through affiliates in marketing activities that compete with its marketing operations. 

The Partnership faces strong competition for acquisitions and development of new projects from both established and start-up companies. Competition increases the cost to acquire existing facilities or businesses and results in fewer commitments and lower returns for new pipelines or other development projects. The Partnership's competitors may have greater financial 

resources than it possesses or may be willing to accept lower returns or greater risks. Competition differs by region and by the nature of the business or the project involved. 

Natural Gas, NGL, Crude Oil and Condensate Supply 

The Partnership's gathering and transmission pipelines have connections with major intrastate and interstate pipelines, which it believes have ample natural gas and NGL supplies in excess of the volumes required for the operation of these systems. The Partnership&#8217;s ORV pipeline, terminals, trucks and storage facilities are strategically located in crude oil and condensate producing regions. The Partnership evaluates well and reservoir data that is either publicly available or furnished by producers or other service providers in connection with the construction and acquisition of its gathering systems and assets to determine the availability of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate supply for its systems and assets and/or obtain a minimum volume commitment from the producer that results in a rate of return on investment. The Partnership does not routinely obtain independent evaluations of reserves dedicated to its systems and assets due to the cost and relatively limited benefit of such evaluations. Accordingly, the Partnership does not have estimates of total reserves dedicated to its systems and assets or the anticipated life of such producing reserves. 

Credit Risk and Significant Customers 

The Partnership is subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers and other counterparties, such as its lenders and hedging counterparties. The Partnership diligently attempts to ensure that it issues credit to only credit-worthy customers. However, the Partnership's purchase and resale of crude oil, condensate, NGLs and natural gas exposes it to significant credit risk, as the margin on any sale is generally a very small percentage of the total sales price. Therefore, a credit loss can be very large relative to the Partnership's overall profitability. Some of the Partnership's customers have filed for bankruptcy protection, and their debts and payments to it are subject to laws governing bankruptcy. Moreover, the combination of a reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in the Partnership's customers' liquidity and ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to the Partnership. Furthermore, some of the Partneship's customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to the Partnership. A substantial portion of the Partnership's throughput volumes come from producers that have investment-grade ratings; however, many of its customers' equity values have substantially declined and some of these customers, including Devon, have had their credit ratings downgraded by major credit ratings agencies. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, Devon represented 16.6% &#32;and 30.6% , respectively, of the Partnership's consolidated revenues and Dow Hydrocarbons &#38; Resources LLC (&#8220;Dow Hydrocarbons&#8221;) represented 11.7% &#32;and 11.0% , respectively, of the Partnership's consolidated revenues. No other customer represented greater than 10.0% of the Partnership's revenue. The Partnership's operations are dependent on the volume of natural gas that Devon provides to it under commercial agreements, which constitutes a substantial portion of its natural gas supply. For the foreseeable future, the Partnership expects its profitability to be substantially dependent on Devon. Further, the loss of Dow Hydrocarbons as a customer could have a material impact on the Partnership's results of operations if it was not able to sell its products to another customer with similar margins because the gross operating margins received from transactions with Dow Hydrocarbons are material to its total gross operating margin. 

Regulation 

Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines Regulation. The Partnership owns interstate natural gas pipelines that are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#8220;FERC&#8221;) under the Natural Gas Act (&#8220;NGA&#8221;). Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. FERC regulation extends to such matters as the following: 

&#8226; 

rates, services and terms and conditions of service; 

&#8226; 

the certification and construction of new facilities; 

&#8226; 

the extension or abandonment of services and facilities; 

&#8226; 

the maintenance of accounts and records; 

&#8226; 

the acquisition and disposition of facilities; 

&#8226; 

maximum rates payable for certain services; 

&#8226; 

the initiation and discontinuation of services; 

&#8226; 

internet posting requirements for available capacity, discounts and other matters; 

&#8226; 

pipeline segmentation to allow multiple simultaneous shipments under the same contract; 

&#8226; 

capacity release to create a secondary market for transportation services; 

&#8226; 

relationships between affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business; 

&#8226; 

market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas and NGLs; and 

&#8226; 

participation by interstate pipelines in cash management arrangements. 

Natural gas companies are prohibited from charging rates that have been determined not to be just and reasonable by FERC. In addition, FERC prohibits natural gas companies from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. 

The rates and terms and conditions for the Partnership interstate pipeline services are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Pursuant to FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction over rates, existing rates may be challenged by complaint or by action of FERC under Section 5 of the NGA, and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest. The outcome of any successful complaint or protest against the Partnership's rates could have an adverse impact on revenues associated with providing transportation service. Various aspects of an interstate pipeline&#8217;s rates can be challenged in a rate proceeding at FERC. 

For example, one issue relates to FERC&#8217;s policy regarding allowances for income taxes in determining a regulated entity&#8217;s cost of service. FERC&#8217;s income tax allowance policy is the result of substantial and ongoing litigation regarding whether and to what extent regulated companies are able to recover an allowance for income taxes in rates. Adverse rulings on ratemaking issues such as this one can have detrimental effects on certain rates that can be charged by interstate pipelines. 

Interstate natural gas pipelines regulated by FERC are required to comply with numerous regulations related to standards of conduct, market transparency, and market manipulation. FERC&#8217;s standards of conduct regulate the manner in which interstate natural gas pipelines may interact with its marketing affiliates (unless FERC has granted a waiver of such standards). FERC&#8217;s market oversight and transparency regulations require annual reports of purchases or sales of natural gas meeting certain thresholds and criteria and certain public postings of information on scheduled volumes. FERC&#8217;s market manipulation regulations promulgated pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the &#8220;EPAct 2005&#8221;) make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The EPAct 2005 also amends the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (&#8220;NGPA&#8221;) to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes, up to $1.0 million per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. Should the Partnership fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. 

The Partnership also transports gas in interstate commerce that is subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the NGPA. The maximum rates for services provided under Section 311 of the NGPA may not exceed a &#8220;fair and equitable rate,&#8221; as defined in the NGPA. The rates are generally subject to review every five years by FERC or by an appropriate state agency. The inability to obtain approval of rates at acceptable levels could result in refund obligations, the inability to achieve adequate returns on investments in new facilities and the deterrence of future investment or growth of the regulated facilities. 

Interstate Liquids Pipelines Regulation. The Partnership owns certain liquids and crude oil pipelines providing common carrier interstate service that are subject to regulation by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (&#8220;ICA&#8221;), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and related rules and orders. These assets include the Partnership&#8217;s ORV, VEX and Cajun-Sibon pipeline. 

FERC regulation requires that interstate liquids pipeline rates and terms and conditions of service, including rates for transportation of crude oil, condensate and NGLs, be filed with FERC and that these rates and terms and conditions of service be &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; and not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. 

Rates of interstate liquids pipelines are currently regulated by FERC primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by FERC. For the five-year period beginning in 2010, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 2.65%. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. For the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. Under FERC&#8217;s regulations, liquids pipelines can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-services approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. 

The ICA permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Under certain circumstances, 

FERC could limit the Partnership&#8217;s ability to set rates based on its costs or could order the Partnership to reduce its rates and could require the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the date of the complaint. FERC also has the authority to change the Partnership&#8217;s terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential. 

The rates charged by the Partnership's interstate liquids pipelines may also be affected by the ongoing litigation regarding FERC&#8217;s income tax allowance policy. As the Partnership acquires, constructs and operates new liquids assets and expands its liquids transportation business, the classification and regulation of its liquids transportation services are subject to ongoing assessment and change based on the services it provides and determinations by FERC and the courts. Such changes may subject additional services the Partnership provides to regulation by FERC. 

Gas Pipeline Regulation. The Partnership's intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located. Most states have agencies that possess the authority to review and authorize natural gas transportation transactions and the construction, acquisition, abandonment and interconnection of physical facilities. Some states also have state agencies that regulate transportation rates, service terms and conditions and contract pricing to ensure their reasonableness and to ensure that the intrastate pipeline companies that they regulate do not discriminate among similarly situated customers. 

FERC&#8217;s anti-manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but only to the extent such transactions do not have a &#8220;nexus&#8221; to jurisdictional transactions. As noted above, FERC&#8217;s civil penalty authority under EPAct 2005 would apply to violations of these rules to the extent applicable to the Partnership's intrastate natural gas services. 

Intrastate Liquids Pipeline Regulation. Intrastate NGL and other petroleum pipelines are not generally subject to rate regulation by FERC, but they are subject to regulation by various agencies in the respective states where they are located. While the regulatory regime varies from state to state, state agencies typically require intrastate NGL and petroleum pipelines to file their rates with the agencies and permit shippers to challenge existing rates or proposed rate increases. 

Gathering Pipeline Regulation. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC under the NGA. The Partnership owns a number of natural gas pipelines that it believes meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish a pipeline&#8217;s status as a gatherer not subject to FERC jurisdiction. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements, and in some instances complaint-based rate regulation. 

The Partnership is subject to some state ratable take and common purchaser statutes. The ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. 

FERC&#8217;s anti-manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but only to the extent such transactions do not have a &#8220;nexus&#8221; to jurisdictional transactions. As noted above, FERC&#8217;s civil penalty authority under EPAct 2005 would apply to violations of these rules to the extent applicable to the Partnership's natural gas gathering services. 

Intrastate Natural Gas Storage Regulation . The storage field&#8217;s injection and withdrawal wells used in association with the Acacia system, along with water disposal wells located at the Bridgeport processing facility, are under the jurisdiction of the Texas Railroad Commission (&#8220;TRRC&#8221;). Regulatory requirements for these wells involve monthly and annual reporting of the natural gas and water disposal volumes associated with the operation of such wells, respectively. Results of periodic mechanical integrity tests run on these wells must also be reported to the TRRC. 

Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs. The prices at which the Partnership sells natural gas and NGLs currently are not subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, are not subject to state regulation. The Partnership's natural gas and NGL sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. As noted above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas and NGL industries, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies and NGL pipeline companies that remain subject to FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction. These initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas and NGLs under certain circumstances. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these regulatory changes on the Partnership's natural gas and NGL marketing operations, but we do not believe that the Partnership will be affected by any such FERC action in a manner that is materially different from the natural gas and NGL marketers with whom it competes. 

Employee Safety. The Partnership is subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that the Partnership's operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. 

Pipeline Safety Regulations. The Partnership's pipelines are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;). DOT&#8217;s Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;), acting through the Office of Pipeline Safety (&#8220;OPS&#8221;), administers the national regulatory program to assure the safe transportation of natural gas, petroleum and other hazardous materials by pipeline. OPS develops regulations and other approaches to risk management to assure safety in design, construction, testing, operation, maintenance and emergency response of pipeline facilities. The main bodies of safety regulations that cover the Partnership's operations are set forth at 49 CFR Parts 192 (covering pipelines that transport natural gas) and 195 (pipelines that transport crude oil and condensate, carbon dioxide, NGL and petroleum products). In addition to recordkeeping and reporting requirements, amendments to 49 CFR Part 192 and 195 created the Pipeline Integrity Management in High Consequence Areas requiring operators of transmission pipelines to ensure the integrity of their pipelines through hydrostatic pressure testing, the use of in-line inspection tools or through risk-based direct assessment techniques. In January 2012, the President signed into law the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 which increases potential penalties for pipeline safety violations, gives new rulemaking authority to DOT with respect to shut-off valves on transmission pipeline facilities constructed or entirely replaced after the rule is promulgated, requires DOT to revise incident notification guidance and imposes new records requirements on pipeline owners and operators. This legislation also requires DOT to study and report to Congress on other areas of pipeline safety, including expanding the reach of the integrity management regulations beyond high consequences areas, but restricts DOT from promulgating expanded integrity management rules during the review period and for a period following submission of its report to Congress unless the rulemaking is needed to address a present condition that poses a risk to public safety, property or the environment. PHMSA issued a final rule effective October 25, 2013 that implemented aspects of the new legislation. Among other things, the final rule increases the maximum civil penalties for violations of pipeline safety statutes or regulations, broadens PHMSA&#8217;s authority to submit information requests, and provides additional detail regarding PHMSA&#8217;s corrective action authority. Additionally, PHMSA issued an Advisory Bulletin in May 2012, which advised pipeline operators of anticipated changes in annual reporting requirements and that if they are relying on design, construction, inspection, testing or other data to determine the pressures at which their pipelines should operate, the records of that data must be traceable, verifiable and complete. Locating such records and, in the absence of any such records, verifying maximum pressures through physical testing or modifying or replacing facilities to meet the demands of such pressures could significantly increase the Partnership's costs. Additionally, failure to locate such records or verify maximum pressures could result in reductions of allowable operating pressures, which would reduce available capacity on the Partnership's pipelines. A December 2012 PHMSA Advisory Bulletin provides further clarity on the reporting requirements of the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, describing a general requirement that pipeline owners or operators report an exceedance of the maximum allowable operating pressure or allowable build-up for pressure-limiting or control devices within five days of the date that the exceedance occurs. At the state level, several states have passed legislation or promulgated rulemaking dealing with pipeline safety. We believe that the Partnership's pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable PHMSA and state requirements; however, due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that future compliance with the PHMSA or state requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's results of operations or financial positions. 

As a follow-up to a PHMSA inspection of facilities and records for the Partnership&#8217;s ORV pipeline in December 2012, on November 2, 2015, PHMSA issued a Notice of Probable Violation and Proposed Compliance Order (the &#8220;NOPV&#8221;) asserting that the Partnership has probable violations of 49 CFR Part 195 due to the misclassification of a transmission line as a gathering line. Transmission lines are subject to more fulsome pipeline safety regulations than gathering lines. The NOPV proposed a compliance order requiring the Partnership to satisfy the Part 195 requirements applicable to transmission lines but did not propose a penalty. The Partnership disagrees with the assertion of PHMSA that the pipeline meets the definition of a transmission rather than gathering line. Accordingly, on December 30, 2015, the Partnership objected to the NOPV and requested a hearing. The hearing is not yet scheduled and the Partnership cannot predict the outcome of its challenge. In the event the pipeline in question is ultimately treated as a transmission line rather than a gathering line, the Partnership estimates that its would incur costs of approximately $2.1 million over a two-year period to develop and implement Part 195-compliant integrity management program, including hydrostatic testing and a leak detection and repair program. 

The Partnership owns and operates a high-pressure pipeline and underground natural gas and NGL storage reservoirs and associated facilities near Bayou Corne, Louisiana. In August 2012, a large sinkhole formed in the vicinity of this pipeline and underground storage reservoirs. The Partnership is seeking to recover its losses from responsible parties. The Partnership has sued Texas Brine Company, LLC (&#8220;Texas Brine&#8221;), the operator of a failed cavern in the area, and its insurers seeking recovery 

for these losses. The Partnership has also sued Occidental Chemical Company and Legacy Vulcan Corp. f/k/a Vulcan Materials Company, two Chlor-Alkali plant operators that participated in Texas Brine&#8217;s operational decisions regarding mining the failed cavern. The Partnership also filed a claim with its insurers, which the Partnership's insurers denied. The Partnership disputed the denial and intends to proceed with litigation against its insurers. In August 2014, the Partnership received a partial settlement from Texas Brine's insurers with respect to the Texas Brine claims in the amount of $6.1 million, but additional claims remain outstanding. The Partnership cannot give assurance that we will be able to fully recover its losses through insurance recovery or claims against responsible parties. 

Environmental Matters 

General. The Partnership's operations involve processing and pipeline services for delivery of hydrocarbons (natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensates) from point-of-origin at oil and gas wellheads operated by its suppliers to the Partnership's end-use market customers. The Partnership's facilities include natural gas processing and fractionation plants, natural gas and NGL storage caverns, brine disposal wells, pipelines and associated facilities, fractionation and storage units for NGLs, and transportation and delivery of petroleum. As with all companies in the Partnership's industrial sector, the Partnership's operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases the Partnership's overall costs of doing business, including costs of planning, constructing, and operating plants, pipelines, and other facilities, as well as capital cost items necessary to maintain or upgrade equipment and facilities. Similar costs are likely upon changes in laws or regulations and upon any future acquisition of operating assets. In 2015, the Partnership incurred approximately $1.5 million in clean-up and remediation expenses related to a spill in Ohio. The Partnership provided required notifications to applicable state and federal agencies relating to the spill. This matter has been closed, and no additional expenses are expected. Additionally, the Partnership has incurred approximately $1.8 million to clean-up a spill that occurred in its West Virginia operations. The Partnership is working with state and federal agencies relating to this spill, including providing any required notifications and responding to any inquiries. The Partnership will continue to work with state and federal agencies to bring this matter to a close. 

Any failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to equipment failures, and obtaining required governmental approvals, may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial activities and, in less common circumstances, issuance of temporary or permanent injunctions or construction or operation bans or delays. As part of the regular evaluation of the Partnership's operations, it routinely review and update governmental approvals as necessary. 

The continuing trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts the Partnership currently anticipates. Moreover, risks of process upsets, accidental releases or spills are associated with possible future operations, and the Partnership cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities, including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons as a result of any such upsets, releases or spills. In the event of future increases in environmental costs, the Partnership may be unable to pass on those cost increases to its customers. A discharge of hazardous substances or solid wastes into the environment could, to the extent losses related to the event are not insured, subject the Partnership to substantial expenses, including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to pay fines or penalties that may be assessed and the cost related to claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury or damage to natural resources or property. The Partnership attempts to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to comply with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize costs with respect to more stringent future laws and regulations or more rigorous enforcement of existing laws and regulations. 

Hazardous Substances and Solid Waste. Environmental laws and regulations that relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils, groundwater and surface water and/or include measures to prevent and control pollution may pose the highest potential cost to our industry sector. These laws and regulations generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and may require investigatory and corrective actions at facilities where such waste may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the federal &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to a release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. Potentially liable persons include the owner or operator of the site where a release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at an off-site location, such as a landfill. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek recovery of costs they incur from the 

potentially responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or solid wastes released into the environment. Although petroleum, natural gas and NGLs are excluded from CERCLA&#8217;s definition of a &#8220;hazardous substance,&#8221; in the course of ordinary operations, the Partnership may generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a &#8220;hazardous substance.&#8221; In addition, there are other laws and regulations that can create liability for releases of petroleum, natural gas or NGLs. Moreover, the Partnership may be responsible under CERCLA or other laws for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such substances have been disposed. The Partnership has not received any notification that it may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA or any analogous federal or state law. 

The Partnership also generates, and may in the future generate, both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes that are subject to requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), and/or comparable state statutes. From time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous wastes, including crude oil, condensate and natural gas wastes. Moreover, it is possible that some wastes generated by the Partnership that is currently exempted from the definition of hazardous waste may in the future be designated as &#8220;hazardous wastes,&#8221; resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements. Additionally, the Toxic Substances Control Act (&#8220;TSCA&#8221;) and analogous state laws impose requirements on the use, storage and disposal of various chemicals and chemical substances. Changes in applicable laws or regulations may result in an increase in the Partnership's capital expenditures or plant operating expenses or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on our production and operations. 

The Partnership currently owns or leases, has in the past owned or leased, and in the future may own or lease, properties that have been used over the years for brine disposal operations, crude oil and condensate transportation, natural gas gathering, treating or processing and for NGL fractionation, transportation or storage. Solid waste disposal practices within the NGL industry and other oil and natural gas related industries have improved over the years with the passage and implementation of various environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, some hydrocarbons and other materials may have been released on or under various properties owned, leased or operated by the Partnership during the operating history of those facilities. In addition, a number of these properties may have been operated by third parties over whose operations practices the Partnership had no control. These properties and materials thereon may be subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, CERCLA, RCRA, TSCA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, the Partnership could be required, alone or in participation with others, to remove or remediate property contamination, if present, including groundwater contamination, or to take action to prevent future contamination. 

Air Emissions. Many of the Partnership's current and future operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including the Partnership's facilities, and impose various controls together with monitoring and reporting requirements. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, the Partnership may be required to obtain environmental agency approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in an increase in existing air emissions, obtain and comply with the terms of air permits, which include various emission and operational limitations, or use specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. The Partnership likely will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment or additional monitoring requirements in connection with maintaining or obtaining governmental approvals addressing air emission-related issues. Failure to comply with applicable air statutes or regulations may lead to the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties and may result in the limitation or cessation of construction or operation of certain air emission sources. Although we can give no assurances, we believe such requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's financial condition or operating results, and the requirements are not expected to be more burdensome to the Partnership than to any similarly situated company. 

In addition, the EPA included Wise County, the location of our Bridgeport facility, in its January 2012 revision to the Dallas-Ft. Worth ozone nonattainment area for the 2008 revised ozone national ambient air quality standard (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;). As a result of this designation, new major sources, meaning sources that emit greater than 100 tons/year of nitrogen oxides (&#8220;NOx&#8221;) and volatile organic compounds (&#8220;VOCs&#8221;), as well as major modifications of existing facilities resulting in net emissions increases of greater than 40 tons/year of NOx or VOCs, are subject to more stringent new source review (&#8220;NSR&#8221;) pre-construction permitting requirements than they would be in an area that is in attainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS. NSR pre-construction permits can take twelve to eighteen months to obtain and require the permit applicant to offset the proposed emission increases with reductions elsewhere at a 1.15 to 1 ratio. On June 2, 2015, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied petitions for review filed by Devon, Texas industry trade groups and the State of Texas challenging the nonattainment designation of Wise County under the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Consequently, Wise County is now required to meet the 2008 revised ozone NAAQS. 

On April 17, 2012, the EPA approved final rules under the Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines and processing operations. These rules became effective on October 15, 2012. For new or reworked hydraulically-fractured gas wells, the rules require the use of green completions by all such wells except wildcat (exploratory) and delineation gas wells and low reservoir pressure non-wildcat and non-delineation gas wells. The rules also 

establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from wet seal and reciprocating compressors at production facilities, gathering systems, boosting facilities and onshore natural gas processing plants, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels at production facilities, gathering systems, boosting facilities and onshore natural gas processing plants. In addition, the rules revise existing requirements for volatile organic compound emissions from equipment leaks at onshore natural gas processing plants by lowering the leak definition for valves from 10,000 parts per million to 500 parts per million and requiring the monitoring of connectors, pumps, pressure relief devices and open-ended lines. These rules required a number of modifications to our assets and operations. Responding to rule challenges, the EPA has since revised certain aspects of its April 2012 rules and has indicated that it may reconsider other aspects of the rules. 

Compliance with these and other modified or newly issued rules could result in an increase in capital expenditures and operating costs for the Partnership and for other companies in the Partnership's industry. While the Partnership is not able at this time to estimate such additional costs, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the Partnership's industry, they could be significant for the Partnership. Compliance with such rules, as well as any new state rules, may also make it more difficult for the Partnership's suppliers and customers to operate, thereby reducing the volume of natural gas transported through the Partnership's pipelines, which may adversely affect its business. 

Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as &#8220;greenhouse gases,&#8221; present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (&#8220;PSD&#8221;) pre construction permits, and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources. Under these regulations, facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards for their greenhouse gas emissions established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case by case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement will be open for signing on April 22, 2016 and will require countries to review and &#8220;represent a progression&#8221; in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. 

Because regulation of greenhouse gas emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect the Partnership and other companies operating in the oil and gas industry. In addition to these developments, recent judicial decisions have allowed certain tort claims alleging property damage to proceed against greenhouse gas emissions sources, which may increase the Partnership's litigation risk for such claims. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with greenhouse gas emissions, we cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on the Partnership. 

Federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which the Partnership conducts business could adversely affect the availability of, or demand for, the products the Partnership stores, transports and processes, and, depending on the particular program adopted, could increase the costs of the Partnership's operations, including costs to operate and maintain its facilities, install new emission controls on its facilities, acquire allowances to authorize its greenhouse gas emissions, pay any taxes related to its greenhouse gas emissions and/or administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program. The Partnership may be unable to recover any such lost revenues or increased costs in the rates the Partnership charges its customers, and any such recovery may depend on events beyond the Partnership's control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or regulations. Reductions in the Partnership's revenues or increases in its expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on the Partnership's business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. 

Due to its location, the Partnership&#8217;s operations along the Gulf Coast are vulnerable to operational and structural damages resulting from hurricanes and other severe weather systems, while inland operations include areas subject to tornadoes. The Partnership's insurance may not cover all associated losses. The Partnership is taking steps to mitigate physical risks from storms, but no assurance can be given that future storms will not have a material adverse effect on its business. 

Hydraulic Fracturing and Wastewater. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including NGL related wastes, into state waters or waters of the United States. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recently adopted a rule to clarify the meaning of the term &#8220;waters of the United States&#8221; with respect to federal jurisdiction. Many interested parties believe that the proposed rule expands federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. Regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws require that entities that discharge into federal and state waters obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (&#8220;NPDES&#8221;) permits and/or state permits authorizing these discharges. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws 

assess administrative, civil and criminal penalties for discharges of unauthorized pollutants into the water and impose substantial liability for the costs of removing spills from such waters. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require that individual permits or coverage under general permits be obtained by covered facilities for discharges of storm water runoff. We believe that the Partnership is in substantial compliance with Clean Water Act permitting requirements as well as the conditions imposed thereunder and that continued compliance with such existing permit conditions will not have a material effect on the Partnership&#8217;s results of operations. 

The Partnership operates brine disposal wells that are regulated as Class II wells under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;). The SDWA imposes requirements on owners and operators of Class II wells through the EPA&#8217;s Underground Injection Control program, including construction, operating, monitoring and testing, reporting and closure requirements. The Partnership&#8217;s brine disposal wells are also subject to comparable state laws and regulations, which in some cases are more stringent than requirements under the SDWA. Compliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding the Partnership&#8217;s brine disposal wells may impose substantial costs and restrictions on our brine disposal operations, as well as adversely affect demand for the Partnership&#8217;s brine disposal services. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste waters and an observed increase in minor seismic activity and tremors. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of minor seismic events have reduced injection volumes or suspended operations, often voluntarily. A 2012 report published by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. However, some state regulatory agencies, including Texas and Ohio where the Partnership operates brine disposal wells, have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, TRRC rules allow the TRRC to modify, suspend, or terminate a permit based on a determination that the permitted activity is likely to be contributing to seismic activity. In the state of Ohio, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (&#8220;ODNR&#8221;) requires a seismic study prior to the authorization of any new disposal well. In addition, the ODNR has instituted a continuous monitoring network of seismographs and is able to curtail injected volumes regionally based upon seismic activity detected. Regulatory agencies are continuing to study possible linkage between injection activity and induced seismicity. To the extent these studies result in additional regulation of injection wells, such regulations could impose additional regulations, costs and restrictions on the Partnership&#8217;s brine disposal operations. 

It is common for the Partnership's customers or suppliers to recover natural gas from deep shale formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of wells by oil and gas producers. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states and localities have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and other regulatory requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, in August 2015, the EPA proposed updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane, a greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;), and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. Congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local governments have also adopted and may seek to adopt further ordinances regulating, within their jurisdictions, the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. 

Additional regulatory burdens in the future, whether federal, state or local, could increase the cost of or restrict the ability of the Partnership's customers or suppliers to perform hydraulic fracturing. As a result, any increased federal, state or local regulation could reduce the volumes of natural gas that the Partnership&#8217;s customers move through its gathering systems which would materially adversely affect the Partnership&#8217;s revenues and results of operations. 

Endangered Species and Migratory Birds . The Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;), Migratory Bird Treaty Act (&#8220;MBTA&#8221;), and similar state and local laws restrict activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats or migratory birds. Some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, potentially exposing us to liability for impacts on an individual member of a species or to habitat. The Endangered Species Act can also make it more difficult to secure a federal permit for a new pipeline. 

Office Facilities 

The Partnership occupies approximately 108,500 square feet of space at our executive offices in Dallas, Texas under a lease expiring in August 2019. In November 2014, the Partnership entered into a new agreement to lease approximately 157,600 square feet of space for its executive offices in Dallas, Texas with a lease term commencing in August 2016 and expiring in February 2030. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Partnership (through its subsidiaries) employed approximately 1,432 full-time employees. Approximately 323 of the Partnership&#8217;s employees were general and administrative, engineering, accounting and commercial personnel and the remainder were operational employees. The Partnership is not party to any collective bargaining agreements and it has not had any significant labor disputes in the past. The Partnership believes that it has good relations with its employees.
