Business 

Company Overview 

Hanesbrands Inc., a Maryland corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, &#8220;Hanesbrands,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is a socially responsible manufacturer and marketer of leading everyday basic apparel under some of the world&#8217;s strongest apparel brands, including Hanes, Champion, Maidenform, DIM, Playtex, Bali, JMS/Just My Size, Nur Die/Nur Der, L&#8217;eggs, Lovable, Wonderbra, Flexees, Lilyette and Gear for Sports. 

We sell bras, panties, shapewear, hosiery, men&#8217;s underwear, children&#8217;s underwear, socks, T-shirts and other activewear in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe. In the United States, we sell more units of intimate apparel, male underwear and children&#8217;s underwear than any other company. Unlike most apparel companies, Hanesbrands primarily operates its own manufacturing facilities. More than 80 percent of the apparel units that we sell in the United States are manufactured in our own plants or those of dedicated contractors. 

We have a long history of innovation, product excellence and brand recognition. In fact, more than 80 percent of U.S. households have our products in them. We revolutionized Tagless T-shirts and underwear, we invented the sports bra, we were the first to advertise a bra on national television ( Playtex ). We are now using our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy to integrate our brand superiority, industry-leading innovation and low-cost global supply chain to provide higher valued products while lowering production costs. Our Tagless apparel platform, ComfortFlex Fit bra platform, ComfortBlend fabric platform and temperature-control X-Temp fabric platform incorporate big-idea innovation to span brands, product categories, business segments, retailer and distribution channels and geographies. 

Founded in 1901, we were organized as a Maryland corporation in 2005 and spun off from Sara Lee Corporation in 2006, at which time we became an independent, publicly-traded corporation. Since then, we have used strategic acquisitions to expand our brand portfolio. In November 2010, we expanded our activewear portfolio through the acquisition of GearCo, Inc., known as Gear for Sports , a leading seller of licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores and other channels. In October 2013, we acquired Maidenform Brands Inc., a global intimate apparel company, including the brands Maidenform , Flexees &#32;and Lilyette . We acquired another portfolio of strong brands including DIM , Nur Die/Nur Der , Lovable , Shock Absorber &#32;and Abanderado &#32;through the August 2014 acquisition of DBA Lux Holding S.A. (&#8220;Hanes Europe Innerwear&#8221;), a leading marketer of intimate apparel, hosiery and underwear in Europe. Most recently, in April 2015, we acquired Knights Holdco, Inc. (&#8220;Knights Apparel&#8221;), a leading seller of licensed collegiate logo apparel primarily in the mass retail channel. We believe these acquisitions will create growth and cost savings opportunities and increased scale to serve retailers. 

We take great pride in our strong reputation for ethical business practices and the success of our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility program for community and environmental improvement. Hanesbrands was a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star Sustained Excellence Award winner for 2012-2015 and Partner of the Year winner in 2010 and 2011. We have significant goals for reducing our energy use, carbon emissions and water use and publicly report our progress. We are also a recognized leader for our community-building, philanthropy and workplace practices. More information about our Hanes for Good corporate responsibility initiatives may be found at www.HanesForGood.com . 

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31. All references to &#8220; 2015 &#8221;, &#8220; 2014 &#8221; and &#8220; 2013 &#8221; relate to the 52 week fiscal year ended on January 2, 2016 , the 53 week fiscal year ended on January 3, 2015 , and the 52 week fiscal year ended on December 28, 2013 , respectively. A significant subsidiary of ours, DBA Lux Holding S.A. (&#8220;Hanes Europe Innerwear&#8221;), had a 53 week fiscal year ended on January 2, 2016 as a result of aligning Hanes Europe Innerwear&#8217;s year end with ours in the year after acquisition. The difference in reporting one additional week of financial information for Hanes Europe Innerwear did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Our portfolio of leading brands is designed to address the needs and wants of various consumer segments across a broad range of basic apparel products. Our brands hold either the number one or number two U.S. market position by units sold in most product categories in which we compete.

Our Segments 

Our operations are managed and reported in four operating segments, each of which is a reportable segment for financial reporting purposes: Innerwear, Activewear, Direct to Consumer and International. These segments are organized principally by product category, geographic location or distribution channel. Each segment has its own management that is responsible for the operations of the segment&#8217;s businesses, but the segments share a common supply chain and media and marketing platforms. 

The following table summarizes our operating segments by product category:

We also sell licensed collegiate logo apparel primarily in the mass retail channel under our Knights Apparel &#32;brand.

Our largest international markets are Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia. 

Customers and Distribution Channels 

In 2015 , approximately 80% of our net sales were to customers in the United States and approximately 20% were to customers outside the United States. Domestically, almost 87% of our net sales were wholesale sales to retailers, 9% were direct to consumers and 4% were wholesale sales to wholesalers and third party embellishers. We have well-established relationships with some of the largest apparel retailers in the world. Our largest customers are Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (&#8220;Wal-Mart&#8221;), Target and Kohl&#8217;s Corporation (&#8220;Kohl&#8217;s&#8221;), accounting for 23% , 15% &#32;and 5% , respectively, of our total net sales in 2015. As is common in the basic apparel industry, we generally do not have purchase agreements that obligate our customers to purchase our products. However, all of our key customer relationships have been in place for 10 years or more. Wal-Mart and Target are our only customers with sales that exceed 10% of any individual segment&#8217;s sales. In our Innerwear segment, Wal-Mart accounted for 35% of net sales and Target accounted for 17% of net sales during 2015 . In our Activewear segment, Target accounted for 28% of net sales and Wal-Mart accounted for 21% of net sales. 

Sales to the mass merchant channel in the United States accounted for approximately 49% of our net sales in 2015. We sell all of our product categories in this channel, including our Hanes , Champion , Playtex, Maidenform and JMS / Just My Size &#32;brands, as well as licensed logo apparel. Mass merchants feature high-volume, low-cost sales of basic apparel items along with a diverse variety of consumer goods products, such as grocery and drug products and other hard lines, and are characterized by large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Target. Our largest mass merchant customer is Wal-Mart, which accounted for approximately 23% &#32;of our total net sales in 2015 . 

Sales to the mid-tier and department stores channel in the United States accounted for approximately 15% of our net sales in 2015 . Mid-tier stores target a higher-income consumer than mass merchants, focus more of their sales on apparel items rather than other consumer goods such as grocery and drug products and are characterized by large retailers such as Kohl&#8217;s, J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and Sears Holdings Corporation. We sell all of our product categories in this channel. Traditional department stores target higher-income consumers and carry more high-end, fashion conscious products than mid-tier stores or 

mass merchants and tend to operate in higher-income areas and commercial centers. Traditional department stores are characterized by large retailers such as Macy&#8217;s, Inc. and Belk, Inc. We sell products in our intimate apparel, underwear, socks, hosiery and activewear categories through department stores. We also sell products in the e-commerce environment through our owned e-commerce websites and through e-commerce retailers such as Amazon. 

Sales in our Direct to Consumer segment accounted for approximately 7% of our net sales in 2015 . We sell our branded products directly to consumers through our 252 domestic outlet stores, as well as our websites operating under the Hanes , One Hanes Place , JMS / Just My Size, Champion &#32;and Maidenform &#32;names. Our outlet stores are value-based, offering the consumer a savings of 25% to 40% off suggested retail prices, and sell first-quality, excess, post-season, obsolete and slightly imperfect products. Our websites, supported by emails, address the growing e-commerce channel that characterizes today&#8217;s 24/7 retail environment . Our websites recorded 36 million user sessions in 2015, with 8 million consumers receiving our emails. 

Sales in our International segment represented approximately 20% of our net sales in 2015 , and included sales in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Canada, Australia, the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean. Our largest international markets are Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia. We also have offices in each of these markets, as well as the Philippines, Thailand, Argentina, South Africa and Central America. Internationally, the majority of our net sales were wholesale sales to retailers. For more information about our sales on a geographic basis, see Note, &#8220;Geographic Area Information,&#8221; to our financial statements. 

Sales in other channels in the United States represented approximately 9% of our net sales in 2015 . We sell T-shirts, golf and sport shirts and fleece sweatshirts to wholesalers and third party embellishers primarily under our Hanes , Champion &#32;and Hanes Beefy-T &#32;brands. We also sell a significant range of our underwear, activewear and socks products under the Champion &#32;brand to wholesale clubs, such as Costco Wholesale Corporation, and sporting goods stores, such as The Sports Authority, Inc. We sell primarily legwear and underwear products under the Hanes &#32;and L&#8217;eggs &#32;brands to food, drug and variety stores. We also sell licensed logo apparel in collegiate bookstores . &#32;We sell products that span across our Innerwear and Activewear segments to the U.S. military for sale to servicemen and servicewomen and through discount retailers, such as the Dollar General Corporation and Family Dollar Stores, Inc. 

Manufacturing, Sourcing and Distribution 

During 2015 , approximately 65% of our cost of sales were from finished goods manufactured through a combination of facilities we own and operate and facilities owned and operated by third party contractors who perform some of the steps in the manufacturing process for us, such as cutting and/or sewing. We sourced the remainder of our finished goods from third party manufacturers who supply us with finished products based on our designs. In making decisions about the location of manufacturing operations and third party sources of supply, we consider a number of factors, including labor, local operating costs, quality, regional infrastructure, applicable quotas and duties and freight costs. We believe that our balanced approach to product supply, which relies on a combination of owned, contracted and sourced manufacturing located across different geographic regions, increases the efficiency of our operations, reduces product costs and offers customers a reliable source of supply. 

Finished Goods That Are Manufactured by Hanesbrands 

The manufacturing process for the finished goods that we manufacture begins with raw materials we obtain from suppliers. The principal raw materials in our product categories are cotton and synthetics. Cotton and synthetic materials are typically spun into yarn, which is then knitted into cotton, synthetic and blended fabrics. We source all of our yarn requirements from large-scale domestic and international suppliers. To a lesser extent, we purchase fabric from several domestic and international suppliers in conjunction with scheduled production. In addition to cotton yarn and cotton-based textiles, we use thread, narrow elastic and trim for product identification, buttons, zippers, snaps and lace. These fabrics are cut and sewn into finished products, either by us or by third party contractors. We currently operate 47 manufacturing facilities. Most of our cutting and sewing operations are strategically located in Asia, Central America and the Caribbean Basin. Alternate sources of these materials and services are readily available. 

Finished Goods That Are Manufactured by Third Parties 

In addition to our manufacturing capabilities, we also source finished goods we design from third-party manufacturers, also referred to as &#8220;turnkey products.&#8221; Many of these turnkey products are sourced from international suppliers by our strategic sourcing hubs in Asia. 

All contracted and sourced manufacturing must meet our high quality standards. Further, all contractors and third-party manufacturers must be preaudited and adhere to our strict supplier and business practices guidelines. These requirements provide strict standards that, among other things, cover hours of work, age of workers, health and safety conditions and conformity with local laws and Hanesbrands&#8217; standards. Each new supplier must be inspected and agree to comprehensive 

compliance terms prior to performance of any production on our behalf. We audit compliance with these standards and maintain strict compliance performance records. In addition to our audit procedures, many of our suppliers are certified by the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production, or &#8220;WRAP,&#8221; program. WRAP uses third-party, independent audit firms and requires factory-by-factory certification. We are also a fully accredited participating company in the Fair Labor Association. 

Distribution 

As of January 2, 2016 , we distributed our products from 37 distribution centers. These facilities include 16 facilities located in the United States and 21 facilities located outside the United States in regions where we manufacture our products. We internally manage and operate 26 of these facilities, and we use third party logistics providers who operate the other 11 facilities on our behalf. International distribution operations use a combination of third party logistics providers, as well as owned and operated distribution operations, to distribute goods to our various international markets. 

Inventory 

Effective inventory management is a key component of our future success. Because our customers generally do not purchase our products under long-term supply contracts, but rather on a purchase order basis, effective inventory management requires close coordination with the customer base. We seek to ensure that products are available to meet customer demands while effectively managing inventory levels. We employ various types of inventory management techniques that include collaborative forecasting and planning, supplier-managed inventory, key event management and various forms of replenishment management processes. Our supplier-managed inventory initiative is intended to shift raw material ownership and management to our suppliers until consumption, freeing up cash and improving response time. We have demand management planners in our customer management group who work closely with customers to develop demand forecasts that are passed to the supply chain. We also have professionals within the customer management group who coordinate daily with our larger customers to help ensure that our customers&#8217; planned inventory levels are in fact available at their individual retail outlets. Additionally, within our supply chain organization we have dedicated professionals who translate the demand forecast into our inventory strategy and specific production plans. These individuals work closely with our customer management team to balance inventory investment/exposure with customer service targets. 

Seasonality and Other Factors 

Our operating results are subject to some variability due to seasonality and other factors. For instance, we generally have higher sales during the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons and during periods of cooler weather, which benefits certain product categories such as fleece. Our diverse range of product offerings, however, provides some mitigation to the impact of seasonal changes in demand for certain items. Sales levels in any period are also impacted by customers&#8217; decisions to increase or decrease their inventory levels in response to anticipated consumer demand. Our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice to us. Media, advertising and promotion expenses may vary from period to period during a fiscal year depending on the timing of our advertising campaigns for retail selling seasons and product introductions. 

Product Innovation and Marketing 

A significant component of our margin-enhancing Innovate-to-Elevate strategy is our strong product research and development and innovation capabilities. From 2013 to 2015, we spent nearly $177 million on design, research and product development, including the development of new and improved products. 

We use a disciplined, consumer-driven approach to direct our product innovation and marketing efforts. We seek to identify relevant consumer insights and long-term megatrends that will impact our product categories over the next five to 10 years. We focus our innovation efforts on big-idea platforms that span brands, product categories, business segments, distribution channels and geographies. In addition, we concentrate on margin accretive product innovations where we can leverage our supply chain in order to drive further economies of scale. Examples of our product innovation platforms include: 

&#8226; 

Tagless: Over a decade ago, we launched Hanes &#32;Tagless Tees that deliver superior softness without the itch and irritation of a tag. In 2012, our consumer-driven innovation process led us to expand this platform to the male underwear bottom category where research indicated that itchy tags were the number two consumer complaint. The Tagless platform also taps into the power of our supply chain, generating significant cost savings and allowing us to expand gross margins. 

&#8226; 

ComfortBlend: ComfortBlend, our fabric innovation that combines cotton and synthetic yarns for products that are softer, shrink less and dry faster, is an outgrowth of the performance fabric megatrend. In developing ComfortBlend, we worked through each step of the big idea process, testing the concept, the product and the advertising. We 

introduced Hanes &#32;men&#8217;s ComfortBlend underwear in 2012 with exceptional results and have now expanded this platform to socks, children&#8217;s underwear and panties. 

&#8226; 

ComfortFlex Fit: Our ComfortFlex Fit platform is another example of our consumer-driven innovation process, where research indicated the two most significant consumer complaints in the bra category were that the consumer could not find the right size and that the consumer could not find a comfortable bra. ComfortFlex Fit effectively addresses both concerns by combining a simplified shopping system that eliminates the complicated cup-and-band combinations of traditional bra sizing systems with a more comfortable, flexible fit. We have successfully leveraged the ComfortFlex Fit platform across our Hanes , &#32;Champion, Playtex , &#32;Bali , and JMS / Just My Size &#32;brands where it is driving incremental purchases in a category where consumers typically buy only a little over three bras per year. 

&#8226; 

X-Temp: X-Temp is our newest platform and brings a new level of technology and comfort to basic apparel. Hanes and &#32;Champion X-Temp garments are designed to keep consumers cooler and drier by increasing the rate of evaporation when body temperature rises and reducing the rate of evaporation as body temperature cools. The X-Temp platform was successfully introduced in Hanes &#32;men&#8217;s underwear and men&#8217;s socks in 2013 and expanded to women&#8217;s socks, panties, bras, legwear, base layer and children&#8217;s underwear and socks in 2014. Champion Vapor with X-Temp technology was introduced in men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s activewear in 2013 and expanded to team practicewear and branded printwear in 2014. 

Driving innovation platforms across categories is a major element of our Innovate-to-Elevate strategy as it enables us to meet key consumer needs and leverage advertising dollars. We believe that the strength of our consumer insights, our distinctive brand propositions and our focus on integrated marketing give us a competitive advantage in the fragmented apparel marketplace. Effectively marketing these innovations also accrues benefits back to our supply chain. Driving higher volume helps us to leverage scale and drive costs down even further, increasing margins while funding additional marketing support for our brands and products so we can continue to reinvest in product innovation. 

In 2015, our broad-reach marketing efforts included: 

&#8226; 

National advertising for our flagship Hanes &#32;brand starring Michael Jordan highlighting our Hanes &#32;Tagless tees and underwear; 

&#8226; 

A cross-category, multi-media Hanes &#32;advertising campaign designed to build awareness of our revolutionary X-Temp cooling technology; 

&#8226; 

Television and social media advertising featuring our ComfortFlex Fit bras by Hanes and Bali ; and 

&#8226; 

Continued advertising support for our Champion brand, highlighting the new Absolute Sports Bra with SmoothTec band and our Champion &#32;Vapor fast-dying performance apparel. 

Competition 

The basic apparel market is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Competition generally is based upon brand, comfort, fit, style and price. Our businesses face competition today from other large corporations and foreign manufacturers. Fruit of the Loom, Inc., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., competes with us across most of our segments through its own offerings and those of its Russell Corporation and Vanity Fair Intimates offerings. Other competitors in our Innerwear segment include Limited Brands, Inc.&#8217;s Victoria&#8217;s Secret brand and Jockey International, Inc. Other competitors in our Activewear segment include various private label and controlled brands sold by many of our customers, as well as Gildan Activewear, Inc. and Gap Inc. Large European intimate apparel distributors such as Triumph International and Calzedonia S.p.A Group compete with us in our International segment. We also compete with many small manufacturers across all of our business segments, including our International segment. Additionally, department stores and other retailers, including many of our customers, market and sell basic apparel products under private labels that compete directly with our brands. Our competitive strengths include our strong brands with leading market positions, our high-volume, core products focus, our significant scale of operations, our global supply chain and our strong customer relationships. We continually strive to improve in each of these areas.

We market our products under hundreds of trademarks and service marks in the United States and other countries around the world, the most widely recognized of which are Hanes , Champion , C9 by Champion , Maidenform, &#32; Playtex , Bali , DIM , JMS/Just My Size , L &#8217; eggs , Duofold , Nur Die/Nur Der , Wonderbra , Gear for Sports , Lilyette , Lovable , Rinbros , Shock Absorber , Abanderado &#32;and Zorba .

We have an active program designed to ensure that our trademarks are registered, renewed, protected and maintained. We plan to continue to use all of our core trademarks and plan to renew the registrations for such trademarks as needed. We also own a number of copyrights. 

&#32;Most of our copyrights are unregistered, although we have a sizable portfolio of copyrighted lace designs that are the subject of a number of registrations at the U.S. Copyright Office. 

We place high importance on product innovation and design, and a number of these innovations and designs are the subject of patents. However, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own proprietary trade secrets, technology and know-how that we have not patented. 

Geographic Financial Summary 

For a summary of our operations by geographic area for each of the three most recent fiscal years, including revenues from external customers and long-lived assets, see Note, &#8220;Geographic Area Information,&#8221; to our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. Some of our international businesses are subject to similar laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, current governmental regulations may change or become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that govern our activities, operations and products that may have adverse environmental and health and safety effects, including laws and regulations relating to generating emissions, water discharges, waste, product and packaging content and workplace safety. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations may result in substantial monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. We are aware of hazardous substances or petroleum releases at certain of our facilities and are working with the relevant environmental authorities to investigate and address such releases. We also have been identified as a &#8220;potentially responsible party&#8221; at certain waste disposal sites undergoing investigation and cleanup under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as Superfund) or state Superfund equivalent programs. Where we have determined that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated, we have accrued amounts in our balance sheet for losses related to these sites. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our remedial environmental obligations historically have not had a material impact on our operations, and we are not aware of any proposed regulations or remedial obligations that could trigger significant costs or capital expenditures in connection with such compliance. 

Corporate Social Responsibility 

Hanesbrands conducts business around the world in a highly ethical manner. We are protective of our strong reputation for corporate citizenship and social responsibility and proud of our significant achievements in the areas of environmental stewardship, workplace quality and community building. 

We call our corporate social responsibility program &#8220;Hanes for Good&#8221; because adhering to responsible and sustainable business practices is good for our company, good for our employees, good for our communities and good for our investors. We own the majority of our supply chain and have more direct control over how we do business than many of our competitors. In fact, more than 80% of the apparel we sell in the United States is produced in facilities that we operate or control. We also have an industry-leading compliance program that helps to ensure our business partners live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves. 

We have been recognized for our socially responsible business practices by such organizations as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star program, corporate responsibility advocate As You Sow, social compliance rating group Free2Work, the United Way and others. We are members of the Fair Labor Association, Sustainable Apparel Coalition, The Sustainability Consortium and Corporate Eco Forum. 

We have made significant progress across a range of corporate social responsibility issues, but we recognize that there is always room for improvement. We pride ourselves on listening to others outside our company and reacting quickly and responsibly if issues emerge. We hope to continue making a positive and lasting contribution to our world in the years to come.
