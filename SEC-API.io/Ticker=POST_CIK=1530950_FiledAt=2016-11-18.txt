Our Businesses 

Post Consumer Brands 

Post Consumer Brands includes the cereal business which manufactures, markets and sells branded and private label RTE cereal and hot cereal products. The RTE cereal category is one of the most prominent categories in the food industry. According to Nielsen&#8217;s expanded All Outlets Combined (xAOC) information, the category was approximately $8.6 billion for the 52-week period ending October 29, 2016. We have leveraged the strength of our brands, category expertise, and over a century of institutional knowledge to create a diverse portfolio of cereals. Post Consumer Brands is the third largest seller of RTE cereals in the United States with an 18.5% share of retail dollar sales and a 21.2% share of retail pound sales for the 52-week period ending October 29, 2016, based on Nielsen&#8217;s xAOC information.

Refrigerated potato products are marketed primarily under the Simply Potatoes &#32;and Diner&#8217;s Choice brands; this &#32; business maintains a main processing facility in Minnesota, with a smaller facility located in Nevada.

Our Active Nutrition products are primarily sold in club, grocery, drug, specialty and convenience stores as well as online. 

Private Brands 

Our Private Brands segment manufactures and distributes organic and conventional private label peanut butter and other nut butters, baking nuts, dried fruit, and trail mixes, with sales to grocery retailers and customers in the food ingredient and foodservice channels primarily in the United States and Canada. We also co-manufacture peanut butter and other nut butters for national brands, private label retail and industrial markets. Our Private Brands business also provides peanut blanching, granulation and roasting services for the commercial peanut industry. 

Our Private Brands segment also includes the business of Attune Foods. Through this business we manufacture and market branded premium natural and organic cereals and snacks, including Uncle Sam high fiber cereals, Attune chocolate probiotic bars and Erewhon gluten-free cereals. Attune Foods also includes the Golden Temple , Peace Cereal , Sweet Home Farm and Willamette Valley Granola Company brands as well as a private label granola business. Attune Foods&#8217; products are largely sold through the natural/specialty channels, as well as in the bulk foods section of both conventional and natural/specialty retailers. Our manufacturing facility in Eugene, Oregon provides us the ability to manufacture a wide variety of product and package formats. Additionally, some products are manufactured under co-manufacturing agreements at various third party facilities located in the United States. 

Sales and Marketing 

Each of our businesses has developed marketing strategies specific to their product lines. For certain of our products, we have consumer-targeted marketing campaigns, which include television, digital and print advertisements, coupon offers, co-marketing arrangements with complementary consumer product and entertainment companies and co-op advertising with select retail customers. We also use traditional outdoor, print and digital advertising and social media, as well as more targeted grass roots programs such as sampling events and business drops in order to increase brand awareness and loyalty at both national and local levels. Our internet and social media efforts are used to educate consumers about the nutritional value of our products and for product promotion and consumer entertainment. 

Our Post Consumer Brands segment sells products primarily through an internal sales staff and broker organizations. We also occasionally sell Post Consumer Brands products to military, internet and foodservice channels and may utilize broker, distribution or similar arrangements for sales of Post Consumer Brands products outside the United States. Our Michael Foods Group segment aligns its sales and marketing efforts by distribution channel, with a dedicated team for each of the foodservice, retail and food ingredient channels. Our Active Nutrition segment uses a flexible sales model that combines a national direct sales force and broker network. Our Private Brands segment primarily sells its products through internal sales staff and broker organizations, including a strong broker network that services the natural/specialty and conventional grocery channels. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development efforts span our business segments. These capabilities extend to ingredients and packaging technologies; new product and process development, as well as analytical support; bench-top and pilot plant capabilities; and research support to operations. We incurred expenses of approximately $16.3 million , $16.8 million and $10.2 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, for research and development activities. 

Raw Materials 

Raw materials used in our businesses consist of ingredients and packaging materials. The principal ingredients for most of our businesses are agricultural commodities, including wheat, oats, other grain products, vegetable oils, fruits, peanuts, almonds and other tree nuts, dairy and soy based proteins, cocoa, corn syrup and sugar. We also buy significant amounts of grain to feed layer hens. Additionally, the principal ingredients for the Michael Foods business are eggs, potatoes and cheese. The principal packaging materials are linerboard cartons, corrugated boxes, plastic containers, flexible and beverage packaging and cartonboard. We purchase raw materials from local, regional, national and international suppliers. With respect to our Michael Foods Group segment, a portion of the division&#8217;s egg needs are satisfied by production from our own hens, with the balance being purchased under third-party egg procurement contracts and in the spot market. Certain of our segments, such as Post Consumer Brands and Private Brands, identify raw material sources to ensure that their products meet the standards and certification requirements for non-GMO, organic and gluten-free. 

Supply and prices paid for raw materials can fluctuate widely due to weather conditions, feed costs, labor disputes, government policies and regulations, industry consolidation, economic climate, energy shortages, transportation delays, commodity market prices, currency fluctuations and other unforeseen circumstances, such as avian influenza which could affect the domestic poultry industry and our egg supply. We continuously monitor worldwide supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to take appropriate action to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production. Although the prices of the principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. 

Cereal processing ovens and most of the Michael Foods production facilities are generally fueled by natural gas or propane, which are obtained from local utilities or other local suppliers. Electricity and steam (generated in on-site, gas-fired boilers) also are used in our processing facilities. Short-term standby propane storage exists at several plants for use in the event of an interruption in natural gas supplies. Oil also may be used to fuel certain operations at various plants in the event of natural gas shortages or when its use presents economic advantages. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. 

Trademarks and Intellectual Property 

We own a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our businesses. Our Post Consumer Brands business&#8217; key trademarks include Post &#174; , Honey Bunches of Oats &#174; , Great Grains &#174; , Spoon Size &#174; &#32;Shredded Wheat, Oh's &#174; , Grape-Nuts &#174; , Honeycomb &#174; , Golden Crisp &#174; , Alpha-Bits &#174; , Frosted Mini Spooners &#174; , Golden Puffs &#174; , Cinnamon Toasters &#174; , Fruity Dyno-Bites &#174; , Cocoa Dyno-Bites &#174; , Berry Colossal Crunch &#174; &#32;and Malt-O-Meal &#174; . The key trademarks for our Michael Foods Group include Papetti&#8217;s &#174; , All Whites &#174; , Better&#8217;n Eggs &#174; , Easy Eggs &#174; , Table Ready &#174; , Abbotsford Farms &#174; , Simply Potatoes &#174; &#32;and Crystal Farm s &#174; . Our Active Nutrition segment&#8217;s key trademarks include Premier Protein &#174; , Joint Juice &#174; , Dymatize &#174; , &#32;Supreme Protein &#174; &#32;and PowerBar &#174; , and the key trademarks for our Private Brands segment are Attune &#174; , Uncle Sam &#174; , Erewhon &#174; , Peace Cereal &#174; &#32;and Sweet Home Farm &#174; . Our trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the United States and most other countries where the related products are sold. 

Certain of our products, such as our Pebbles &#8482; &#32;products, are sold under trademarks that have been licensed from a third party pursuant to a long-term license agreement that covers the sale of such branded products in the United States, Canada and several other international markets. 

Similarly, we own several patents in North America. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 

Seasonality 

Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons or other events. For example, demand for our egg products, cheese and snacking and baking nuts tends to increase during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons, which may result in increased net sales during the first quarter of our fiscal year. 

Working Capital 

A description of our working capital practices is included in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&#38;A in Item 7 of this report. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for our operating expenses and working capital needs. 

Customers 

We sell Post Consumer Brands products primarily to grocery, mass merchandise, supercenters, club store and drug store customers. We also sell to military, internet and foodservice channels. Our Michael Foods Group&#8217;s primary customers include foodservice distributors, national restaurant chains, retail grocery stores and major food manufacturers and processors. Our Active Nutrition segment&#8217;s customers are predominately warehouse club stores, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores and supplement stores. Our Private Brands segment&#8217;s products are sold to the natural/specialty and conventional grocery stores and foodservice and food ingredient customers. 

Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for approximately 13% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our fiscal 2016 consolidated net sales, but certain of our segments depend on sales to large customers. For example, the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, Walmart, accounted for approximately 29% of Post Consumer Brands&#8217; net sales in fiscal 2016. Additionally, the largest customers of our Michael Foods Group segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for approximately 27% of the segment&#8217;s net sales in fiscal 2016, and the largest customers of our Active Nutrition business, Costco and Sam&#8217;s Club, accounted for approximately 48% of the Active Nutrition segment&#8217;s net sales in fiscal 2016. The largest customers of our Private Brands segment, Whole Foods and Trader Joe&#8217;s, accounted for approximately 25% of Private Brands&#8217; net sales in fiscal 2016. 

For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , sales to locations outside of the United States were approximately 7%, 9% and 13% of total net sales, respectively. 

Competition 

The consumer foods industry is highly competitive, and the food categories in which we participate are also very competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. Many of our principal competitors in these categories may have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources. Competition is based on product quality, price, effective promotional activities, and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and price. In addition, in many of our product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label products. The industries in which we operate are expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. 

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 

We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities and agencies. Our activities in Canada and Germany are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to our business in the United States. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, our operations must comply with stringent production, storage, distribution, labeling and marketing standards administered by the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States as well as similar regulatory agencies in Canada and Germany. Products that do not meet regulatory standards may be considered to be adulterated and/or misbranded and subject to recall. Additionally, following the recent adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act, the FDA is developing additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved tracing of food. 

Certain egg products produced by our Michael Foods Group segment are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) regulations regarding quality, labeling and sanitary control, rather than FDA regulations. The Michael Foods egg processing plants that break eggs, and some of our other egg-processing operations, are subject to continuous on-site USDA inspection. Our other facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the USDA, FDA and/or state regulatory authorities, such as state departments of agriculture. 

Our facilities, like those of similar businesses, are subject to certain safety regulations including regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar regulatory agencies in Canada and Germany. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. Additionally, some of the food commodities on which our business relies are subject to governmental agricultural programs (e.g., subsidies and import/export regulations), which have substantial effects on prices and supplies of these commodities. 

Our operations are also subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, wastewater discharge and pretreatment, storm water, waste handling and disposal, and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. In the United States, the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Our foreign facilities are subject to regulations similar to those applicable to us in the United States. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to ensure environmental compliance. 

Employees 

We have approximately 8,700 employees as of November 1, 2016, of which approximately 7,995 are in the United States, approximately 575 are in Canada and approximately 130 are located in other jurisdictions, primarily in Germany. Currently, approximately 12% of our employees are unionized. We have entered into several collective bargaining agreements on terms that we believe are typical for the industries in which we operate. Most of the unionized workers at our facilities are represented under contracts which expire at various times throughout the next several years. As these agreements expire, we believe that the agreements can be renegotiated on terms satisfactory to us. We believe that overall we have good relationships with employees and their representative organizations.
