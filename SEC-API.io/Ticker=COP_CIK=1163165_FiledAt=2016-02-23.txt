CORPORATE STRUCTURE 

ConocoPhillips is the world&#146;s largest independent exploration and production (E&#38;P) company, based on proved reserves and production of liquids and natural gas. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was consummated on August 30, 2002. 

In April 2012, the ConocoPhillips Board of Directors approved the separation of our downstream business into an independent, publicly traded energy company, Phillips 66. Each ConocoPhillips stockholder received one share of Phillips 66 stock for every two shares of ConocoPhillips stock held at the close of business on the record date of April 16, 2012. The separation was completed on April 30, 2012, and activities related to Phillips 66 have been treated as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the separation. 

In 2012, we agreed to sell our interest in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (Kashagan) and our Nigeria and Algeria businesses (collectively, the &#147;Disposition Group&#148;). We sold our Nigeria business in the third quarter of 2014, and we sold Kashagan and our Algeria business in the fourth quarter of 2013. Results for the Disposition Group have been reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. For additional information on all discontinued operations, see Note 3&#151;Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we have operations and activities in 21 countries. Our key focus areas include safely operating producing assets, executing major developments and exploring for new resources in promising areas. Our portfolio includes resource-rich North American tight oil and oil sands assets; lower-risk legacy assets in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia; several major international developments; and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospects. 

At December 31, 2015, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 15,900 people worldwide. 

We are marketing certain non-core assets across all of our segments. For additional information on asset sales, see the &#147;Outlook&#148; section of Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 6&#151;Assets Held for Sale or Sold, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 

Effective November 1, 2015, the Other International and historically presented Europe segments were restructured to align with changes to our internal organization structure. The Libya business was moved from the Other International segment to the historically presented Europe segment, which is now renamed Europe and North Africa. Accordingly, results of operations for the Other International and Europe and North Africa segments have been revised in all periods presented. There was no impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the impact on our segment presentation is immaterial. For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 24&#151;Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2015, our continuing operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, China, Malaysia, and Qatar.

&#160; Total production from continuing operations was 1,589 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED) in 2015, compared with 1,540 MBOED, including Libya, in 2014, an increase of 3 percent. The increase in total average production in 2015 primarily resulted from additional production from major developments, including tight oil plays in the Lower 48; Gumusut in Malaysia; APLNG in Australia; Greater Britannia projects and the J-Area in the U.K.; and the ramp-up of Foster Creek Phase F in Canada. Improved well performance, mostly in the Lower 48, western Canada and Norway, and lower turnaround activity also contributed to higher production in 2015. These increases were largely offset by normal field decline. Production from continuing operations was 1,589 MBOED in 2015, compared with 1,532 MBOED in 2014, excluding Libya, an increase of 57 MBOED, or 4 percent. Full-year production from assets sold or under agreement in 2015 was 64 MBOED. 

Our total average realized price from continuing operations was $34.34 per BOE in 2015, a decrease of 47 percent compared with $64.59 per BOE in 2014, which reflected lower average realized prices across all commodities. Our worldwide annual average crude oil price from continuing operations decreased 48 percent in 2015, from $92.80 per barrel in 2014 to $48.26 per barrel in 2015. Additionally, our worldwide annual average natural gas liquids prices from continuing operations decreased 54 percent, from $38.99 per barrel in 2014 to $17.79 per barrel in 2015. Our worldwide annual average natural gas price from continuing operations decreased 40 percent, from $6.57 per MCF in 2014 to $3.96 per MCF in 2015. Average annual bitumen prices also decreased 66 percent, from $55.13 per barrel in 2014 to $18.72 per barrel in 2015. 

&#160;

ALASKA 

The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids, natural gas and LNG. We are the largest crude oil and natural gas producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in two of North America&#146;s largest oil fields located on Alaska&#146;s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. We also have a significant operating interest in the Alpine Field, located on the Western North Slope. Additionally, we are one of Alaska&#146;s largest owners of state and federal exploration leases, with approximately 0.7 million net undeveloped acres at year-end 2015. Approximately 0.4 million of these acres are located in the National Petroleum Reserve&#151;Alaska (NPRA) and the North Slope, and 0.3 million are located in the Chukchi Sea. In 2015, Alaska operations contributed 19 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 1 percent of our natural gas production.

&#160; *Thousands of barrels per day. 

**Millions of cubic feet per day. 

Greater Prudhoe Area 

The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska&#146;s North Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas plant which processes natural gas to recover natural gas liquids before reinjection into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay&#146;s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. 

Greater Kuparuk Area 

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central production facilities which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a separate seawater treatment plant. Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of rotary-drilled wells and horizontal multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing coiled-tubing drilling. 

Drill Site 2S, in the southwestern area of the Kuparuk Field, was sanctioned in October 2014. First oil was achieved in October 2015 with net peak production estimated at 5 MBOED in 2016. 

The 1H Northeast West Sak (NEWS) oil development targeting the West Sak reservoir in the Kuparuk River Unit, was sanctioned in March 2015. First production is anticipated in 2017. 

Western North Slope 

On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the Alpine Field and three satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. Alpine is located 34 miles west of Kuparuk. In October 2015, first oil was achieved at Alpine West CD5, a new drill site which extends the Alpine reservoir west into the NPRA. Net peak production is estimated at 10 MBOED in 2016. 

The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit, the first unit established entirely within the NPRA, was formed in 2008. In 2015, we received permit approvals and sanctioning from the regulatory agencies for the Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT1) drill site. GMT1 is planned to be connected by road to the CD5 drill site, and production 

&#160;

will be transported by pipeline to the existing Alpine facilities for processing. We are evaluating further exploration and development potential in the NPRA. 

Cook Inlet Area 

We operate the North Cook Inlet Unit, the Beluga River Unit, and the Kenai LNG Facility in the Cook Inlet Area. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet Unit and the Kenai LNG Facility, while we own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River Unit. Our share of production from the units is primarily sold to local utilities and is also used to supply feedstock to the Kenai LNG Plant. 

The Kenai LNG Facility includes a 1.6 million-tons-per-year capacity plant, as well as docking and loading facilities for LNG tankers. LNG from the plant has historically been transported and sold to utility companies in Japan. The plant was idled in late-2012; however, due to a change in market conditions, including additional gas supplies, we were granted a two-year export license from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in April 2014 to export up to 40 billion cubic feet of LNG from the facility. As a result, we shipped six cargoes of LNG from the Kenai Facility to Asia in 2015. In February 2016, our export license was renewed for an additional two years. 

In the first quarter of 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in the Beluga River Unit natural gas field in the Cook Inlet Area. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. 

Point Thomson 

We own a 5 percent interest in the Point Thomson Unit, which is located approximately 60 miles east of Prudhoe Bay. An initial production system is anticipated to be online by second quarter 2016, which is estimated to send 400 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED) of condensate through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). 

Alaska LNG (AKLNG) 

During 2012, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP p.l.c. and TransCanada Corporation (collectively, the &#147;AKLNG co-venturers&#148;), began evaluating a potential LNG project which would liquefy and export natural gas from Alaska&#146;s North Slope and deliver it to market. The AKLNG Project concept is an integrated LNG project consisting of a liquefaction plant, including marine terminal facilities and auxiliary marine vessels, located in south-central Alaska; a natural gas treatment plant, located on the North Slope; and an estimated 800-mile natural gas pipeline, which would connect the two plants. 

The proposed AKLNG natural gas liquefaction plant and terminal would be located in the Nikiski area on the Kenai Peninsula, approximately 60 miles southwest of Anchorage, along the Cook Inlet. In January 2014, the AKLNG co-venturers, the Commissioners of the Alaska Departments of Revenue and Natural Resources, and the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC), a state-owned corporation, signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) for the AKLNG Project. The HOA provides a roadmap of how the parties intend to progress the project, including proposed terms for participation by the State of Alaska as an equity owner, proposed fiscal and regulatory terms, and proposed terms for expansion of project components. During 2014, general legislation was enacted by the State of Alaska, and a joint venture agreement for the preliminary front-end engineering and design phase of the project was executed. The AKLNG Project will require several major federal permits, and in July 2014, an application for an LNG export license was filed with the U.S. DOE to export up to 20 million metric tons a year of LNG for 30 years. In November 2014 and June 2015, the U.S. DOE authorized the export of LNG to free trade agreement (FTA) and non-FTA countries, respectively. In September 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) accepted the project into pre-file status, which initiates the lengthy environmental and safety reviews required to design, permit, construct and operate the plants and pipeline. In March 2015, the FERC issued their Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement for AKLNG and begin the National Environmental Policy Act period to seek public comment. In October 2015, the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (AOGCC) issued orders for gas offtake at Prudhoe Bay and Point Thomson. In December 2015, AGDC acquired the interest in the AKLNG Project previously held by TransCanada Corporation. On December 31, 2015 the HOA expired by its own terms. Commercial negotiations and planning for front-end engineering and design are ongoing. 

&#160;

Significant engineering, technical, regulatory, fiscal, commercial and permitting issues would need to be resolved prior to a final investment decision on the potential $45 billion to $65 billion (gross) project. 

Exploration 

We plan to drill two to three exploration wells in 2016 in the NPRA. 

Our plans to drill an exploration well in the Chukchi Sea have been cancelled due to the current market environment, regulatory uncertainty and expiry of the primary lease term in 2020. As a result, we recorded a $406 million after-tax charge for leasehold and capitalized interest impairment and dry hole expense in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Transportation 

We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south central Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of TAPS. We have a 29.1 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope. 

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double-hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels as necessary. The tankers primarily deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, to refineries on the west coast of the United States. 

LOWER 48 

The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and exploration activities in the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 business is organized within three regions covering the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and Rockies. As a result of tight oil opportunities, we have directed our investments toward certain shorter cycle time, low cost-of-supply plays. In July 2015, we announced our plan to reduce future deepwater exploration spending and terminated our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drillship contract with Ensco. We hold 14.3 million net onshore and offshore acres in the Lower 48. In 2015, the Lower 48 contributed 33 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 36 percent of our natural gas production.

&#160; &#160;

Onshore 

We hold 12.4 million net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional acreage in the Lower 48, the majority of which is either held by production or owned by the company. Our unconventional holdings total approximately 2.6 million net acres in the following areas: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 900,000 net acres in the San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado. &#160; &#149; &#160; 617,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in North Dakota and eastern Montana. &#160; &#149; &#160; 216,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South Texas. &#160; &#149; &#160; 109,000 net acres in the Niobrara, located in northeastern Colorado. &#160; &#149; &#160; 102,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. &#160; &#149; &#160; 61,000 net acres in the Barnett, located in north central Texas. &#160; &#149; &#160; 553,000 net acres in other unconventional exploration plays. The majority of our 2015 onshore production originated from the Eagle Ford, San Juan, Permian and Bakken. Onshore activities in 2015 were centered mostly on continued development of emerging and existing assets, with an emphasis on areas with low cost of supply, particularly in growing unconventional plays. The 2015 drilling activity levels declined relative to 2014 due to reduced capital spending in the low commodity price environment. Our major focus areas in 2015 included the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Eagle Ford&#151;The Eagle Ford continued full field development in 2015, with the majority of the development program being drilled on multi-well pads. We operated six rigs on average in 2015, resulting in 136 operated wells drilled and 150 operated wells brought online. In 2015, we also increased production by 12 percent compared with 2014 and achieved net peak production of 190 MBOED, compared with 179 MBOED in 2014. &#160; &#149; &#160; Bakken&#151;We operated five rigs on average throughout the year in the Bakken. We continued our pad drilling efficiency, drilling 89 operated wells during the year and bringing 128 operated wells online. As a result, we achieved net peak production of 80 MBOED in 2015, compared with 63 MBOED in 2014. &#160; &#149; &#160; San Juan Basin&#151;The San Juan Basin includes significant conventional gas production, which yields approximately 20 percent natural gas liquids, as well as the majority of our U.S. coalbed methane (CBM) production. We hold approximately 1.3 million net acres of oil and gas leases by production in San Juan, where we continue to pursue select conventional development opportunities. This also includes approximately 900,000 net unconventional acres of lease rights. &#160; &#149; &#160; Permian Basin&#151;The Permian Basin is another area where we are leveraging our conventional legacy position by utilizing new technology to improve the ultimate recovery and value from these fields. This technology should also identify new, unconventional plays across the region. We hold approximately 1.0 million net acres in the Permian, which includes 102,000 net unconventional acres. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of certain non-core assets in East Texas and North Louisiana and South Texas. Production from the assets sold was 33 MBOED, approximately 6 percent of the total Lower 48 segment production in 2015. 

Gulf of Mexico 

At year-end 2015, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico primarily consisted of one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 75 percent operated working interest in the Magnolia Field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784. &#160; &#149; &#160; 15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized Ursa Field located in the Mississippi Canyon Area. &#160; &#149; &#160; 15.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Princess Field, a northern subsalt extension of the Ursa Field. &#160; &#149; &#160; 12.4 percent nonoperated working interest in the unitized K2 Field, comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon Area. &#160;

Exploration 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Conventional Exploration In the third quarter of 2015, we decided not to conduct further activity on certain Gulf of Mexico leases. At December 31, 2015, we held approximately 1.8 million net acres in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 

During 2015, we conducted appraisal drilling at Shenandoah, Tiber, and Gila. The nonoperated Gibson exploration and Tiber appraisal wells, and the ConocoPhillips operated Melmar exploration well are currently drilling.

We own a 30 percent nonoperated working interest in the Shenandoah discovery, which was announced in 2009. The third Shenandoah down dip appraisal well was spud in 2015, and planning is underway for the next appraisal well, which is expected to spud in the first half of 2016. 

The operated Harrier and nonoperated Vernaccia wells were expensed as dry holes in 2015. The operator of the Gila prospect has elected to discontinue exploration and appraisal activity. Accordingly, we recorded $111 million in after-tax dry hole expense for a previously suspended well in the Gila prospect, and a $100 million charge for the impairment of undeveloped leasehold costs. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Unconventional Exploration Our onshore focus areas include the Niobrara in the Denver-Julesburg Basin and the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs in the Delaware Basin, as well as several emerging plays. In 2015, we drilled 21 unconventional wells in the Delaware Basin. We continue to assess and appraise this and other unconventional opportunities. 

Facilities 

Freeport LNG Terminal 

In July 2013, we agreed with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to terminate our long-term agreement to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity at Freeport&#146;s 1.5 billion cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. The termination agreement conditions were satisfied in 2014. Our terminal regasification capacity has been reduced from 0.9 billion cubic feet per day to 0.4 billion cubic feet per day until July 1, 2016, at which time it will be reduced to zero. As a result of this transaction, we anticipate saving approximately $50 to $60 million per year in costs over the next 17 years. For additional information, see Note 7&#151;Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Golden Pass LNG Terminal 

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG Terminal and affiliated Golden Pass Pipeline, with a combined net book value of approximately $273 million at December 31, 2015. It is located adjacent to the Sabine-Neches Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. The terminal became commercially operational in May 2011. We hold terminal and pipeline capacity for the receipt, storage and regasification of the LNG purchased from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3) (QG3) and the transportation of regasified LNG to interconnect with major interstate natural gas pipelines. Utilization of the terminal has been and is expected to be limited, as market conditions currently favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets. As a result, we are evaluating opportunities to optimize the value of the terminal facilities. 

Great Northern Iron Ore Properties Trust 

We hold the interest in the Great Northern Iron Ore Properties trust (the Trust), a grantor trust that owns mineral and surface interests in the Mesabi Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota and certain other personal property. Pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust terminated on April 6, 2015. At the end of the wind-down period, documents memorializing our ownership of certain Trust property, including all of the 

&#160;

Trust&#146;s mineral properties and active leases, will be delivered to us. The Trustees currently anticipate the wind-down process, final distribution and dissolution of the Trust will be completed by the end of 2016. At that time, we expect to recognize the fair value of the Trust&#146;s net assets transferred to us. 

Other 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; San Juan Gas Plant&#151;We operate and own a 50 percent interest in the San Juan Gas Plant, a 550 million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing plant in Bloomfield, New Mexico. &#160; &#149; &#160; Lost Cabin Gas Plant&#151;We operate and own a 46 percent interest in the Lost Cabin Gas Plant, a 313 million cubic-feet-per-day capacity natural gas processing facility in Lysite, Wyoming. &#160; &#149; &#160; Helena Condensate Processing Facility&#151;We operate and own the Helena Condensate Processing Facility, a 90,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas. &#160; &#149; &#160; Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility&#151;We operate and own an 87.5 percent interest in the Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility, a 30,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located near Pawnee, Texas. &#160; &#149; &#160; Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility&#151;We operate and own the Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility, a 15,000 barrel-per-day condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas. CANADA 

Our Canadian operations mainly consist of natural gas fields in western Canada and oil sands developments in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. In 2015, operations in Canada contributed 21 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 18 percent of our natural gas production.

&#160; Western Canada 

Our operations in western Canada extend across Alberta and British Columbia. We operate or have ownership interests in approximately 50 natural gas processing plants in the region, and, as of December 31, 2015, held leasehold rights in 3.2 million net acres in western Canada. Our investments in 2015 were focused mainly on opportunities in the following three core development areas: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Deep Basin&#151;We hold leasehold rights in 1.4 million net acres in the Deep Basin, located in northwest Alberta and northeast British Columbia. In 2015, Deep Basin achieved average net production of 48 MBOED, and we drilled 13 horizontal wells. &#160; &#149; &#160; Kaybob-Edson&#151;We hold leasehold rights in 0.8 million net acres in the Kaybob-Edson Area, located south of the Deep Basin in west central Alberta. Net production for Kaybob-Edson averaged 45 MBOED in 2015, and we drilled 15 horizontal wells. &#160; &#149; &#160; Clearwater&#151;Located in west central Alberta, south of Kaybob-Edson, we hold 0.9 million net acres of leasehold rights. In 2015, average net production for Clearwater was 40 MBOED, and we drilled 11 horizontal wells. &#160;

Assets located outside these development areas are focused on production optimization. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we finalized sales of certain non-core assets in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Production from the assets sold was 27 MBOED, approximately 9 percent of the total Canada segment production in 2015. At December 31, 2015, the company held 0.1 million net acres of leasehold rights in these areas. 

Oil Sands 

We hold approximately 0.9 million net acres of land in the Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta. Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy bitumen, which is recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Surmont&#151;The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Surmont is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. Surmont 2 construction began in 2010, and achieved first production in the third quarter of 2015. Surmont&#146;s gross production capacity is estimated to be 150 MBOED. &#160; &#149; &#160; FCCL&#151; FCCL Partnership, a Canadian upstream general partnership, is a 50/50 heavy oil business venture with Cenovus Energy Inc. FCCL&#146;s assets are operated by Cenovus and include the Foster Creek, Christina Lake and Narrows Lake SAGD bitumen developments. FCCL continues to progress development plans for each of these assets, including near-term completion of phase expansions as detailed below: &#160;

&#160; &#161; &#160; &#160; Foster Creek Foster Creek is located approximately 200 miles northeast of Edmonton, Alberta. There are six producing phases at Foster Creek, Phases A through F, with construction continuing on Phase G. Net production at Foster Creek increased approximately 12 MBOED, mainly as a result of a continued ramp up toward full capacity. In the fourth quarter of 2014, FCCL received regulatory approval for Phase J. 

&#160;

&#160; &#161; &#160; &#160; Christina Lake Christina Lake is located approximately 75 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. There are five producing phases at Christina Lake, Phases A through E, with construction continuing on Phase F. In late 2015, an optimization project was completed at Christina Lake that increased gross production capacity to 160 MBOED, with incremental production expected to ramp up during 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2015, regulatory approval was received for Phase H development. 

&#160;

&#160; &#161; &#160; &#160; Narrows Lake Narrows Lake Phase A, was sanctioned in late 2012 and is expected to have 45 MBOED of production capacity; however, construction has been deferred. 

Exploration 

We hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: onshore western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and the Arctic Islands. Our primary exploration focus is on unconventional plays in western Canada and conventional exploration offshore eastern Canada. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Conventional Exploration During 2014, we entered into a farm-in agreement to acquire a 30 percent nonoperated interest in six exploration licenses covering approximately five million gross acres in the deepwater Shelburne Basin, offshore Nova Scotia. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we spudded the first of two exploration well commitments in offshore Nova Scotia. The second exploration well is anticipated to begin drilling in the second quarter of 2016. In December 2014, we participated in a successful bid for one 

&#160;

exploration license covering 0.7 million gross acres located in the Flemish Pass Basin, offshore Newfoundland. In January 2015, we were awarded the license, in which we hold a 30 percent nonoperated interest. Seismic surveys of the subsurface were completed in 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Unconventional Exploration We hold approximately 0.7 million net acres in the emerging Montney, Muskwa, Duvernay and Canol unconventional plays in Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. During 2015, we completed a lease swap and continued to drill exploration and appraisal wells in the Montney play, which extends from British Columbia into Alberta. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded dry hole expense of $185 million after-tax associated with our Horn River, Northwest Territories, Thornbury and Saleski properties, and an impairment charge of $75 million after-tax for unproved properties in the Duvernay, Thornbury, Saleski and Crow Lake areas. 

EUROPE AND NORTH AFRICA 

The Europe and North Africa segment consists of operations and exploration activities in Norway, the United Kingdom and Libya. In 2015, operations in Europe and North Africa contributed 14 percent of our worldwide liquids production and 12 percent of natural gas production.

&#160; The Greater Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway in the North Sea, and comprises three producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk and Embla. Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported to Emden, Germany. Ekofisk South achieved first production in 2013, while Eldfisk II achieved startup in January 2015. Continued development drilling in the Greater Ekofisk Area will contribute additional production over the coming years, as additional wells come online. 

The Alvheim development is located in the northern part of the North Sea and consists of a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and subsea installations. Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle tankers, and natural gas is transported to the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) terminal at St. Fergus, Scotland, through the SAGE pipeline. 

The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian Sea. Produced crude oil is stored in a floating storage unit and exported via shuttle tankers. Part of the natural gas is currently injected into the reservoir for optimization of crude oil production, while the remainder is used as feedstock in a methanol plant in Norway, in which we own an 18 percent interest. 

We also have varying ownership interests in five other producing fields in the Norway sector of the North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, as well as the Aasta Hansteen development. The operator is targeting first gas for Aasta Hansteen by late 2018. 

&#160;

Exploration 

ConocoPhillips participated in four nonoperated exploration and appraisal wells in the Oseberg, Visund and Aasta Hansteen areas. Two wells in the Oseberg area were discoveries and were put on production; the others were discoveries currently undergoing evaluation. ConocoPhillips was awarded two new exploration licenses in early 2015, PL044C and PL782S with interests of 41.9 and 40.0 percent, respectively. Two more licenses were awarded in early 2016, PL845 and PL782SB, both with interests of 40.0 percent. 

Transportation 

We own a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 220-mile pipeline which carries crude oil from Ekofisk to a crude oil stabilization and natural gas liquids processing facility in Teesside, England. In November 2015, we sold our 1.9 percent interest in Norwegian Continental Shelf Gas Transportation (Gassled), which owns most of the Norwegian gas transportation infrastructure.

&#160; * Does not include partner operated Alder project; first gas due 2016. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Britannia is one of the largest natural gas and condensate fields in the North Sea. We assumed operatorship of Britannia in August 2015, following the acquisition of third party equity in Britannia Operator Limited, which is now wholly owned by ConocoPhillips. Condensate is delivered through the Forties Pipeline to an oil stabilization and processing plant near the Grangemouth Refinery in Scotland, while natural gas is transported through Britannia&#146;s line to St. Fergus, Scotland. The Britannia satellite fields, Callanish and Brodgar, produce via subsea manifolds and pipelines linked to the Britannia platform. Project startups for the Brodgar H3 susbsea tieback, and Enochdhu, a single well tie back to Callanish, were achieved in the first and second quarters of 2015, respectively. These projects increased Britannia&#146;s production in 2015 by 13.8 MBOED net. We are continuing work to hook up the Alder module to the Britannia facilities and anticipate delivery of first gas in 2016. Alder is a high-pressure, high-temperature gas condensate reservoir located in the U.K. Continental Shelf, 17 miles west of the Britannia facilities. 

The J-Area consists of the Judy/Joanne, Jade and Jasmine fields, located in the U.K. Central North Sea. The Jasmine Field is a high-pressure, high-temperature gas condensate reservoir located approximately six miles west of the Judy Platform. The development includes a 24-slot wellhead platform with a bridge-linked accommodation and utilities platform, a six-mile, 16-inch multi-phase pipeline bundle, and a riser and processing platform bridge-linked to the existing Judy Platform. 

We have various ownership interests in several producing gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas of the Southern North Sea. Decommissioning activity in the Southern North Sea is ongoing, with final production from the Viking transportation system and associated satellites achieved in early 2016. Our interests in the East Irish Sea include the Millom, Dalton and Calder fields, which are operated on our behalf by a third party. 

&#160;

We own a 24 percent interest in the Clair Field, located in the Atlantic Margin. Clair Ridge is the second phase of development for the Clair Field and is comprised of a 36-slot drilling and production facility with a bridge-linked accommodation and utilities platform. The new facilities will tie into existing oil and gas export pipelines to the Shetland Islands. Initial production for Clair Ridge is targeted for 2018. 

Exploration 

During 2015, we participated in a nonoperated exploration/appraisal well in the Greater Clair area which was a discovery. The discovery is undergoing evaluations for future development. We also drilled one operated exploration well north of the Jasmine Field in the Central Graben which was a dry hole, and were awarded two new licenses in the East Irish Sea. 

Transportation 

We operate the Teesside oil and Theddlethorpe gas terminals in which we have 29.3 percent and 50 percent ownership interests, respectively. We also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the Rivers Gas Terminal, operated by a third party. 

Greenland 

Exploration 

In 2015, we conducted field-based, metocean studies in Baffin Bay in Block 2011/11 of our operated Qamut license. Additionally, we participated in a 2-D seismic acquisition program and geological and geophysical studies as part of the work program obligation in the nonoperated Avinngaq license. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated the process to assign our participating interest in the Avinngaq license. The process is pending Greenland government approval.

&#160; The Waha Concession consists of multiple concessions and encompasses nearly 13 million gross acres in the Sirte Basin. Our production operations in Libya and related oil exports were interrupted in mid-2013, as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil export terminal at the end of July 2013. The Es Sider Terminal briefly reopened in the third quarter of 2014 and production and liftings resumed temporarily; however, further disruptions occurred in December 2014, and production was shut in again. The Es Sider Terminal remained shut in throughout 2015. The 2016 operating and drilling activity is uncertain as a result of the ongoing civil unrest.

&#160; Australia Pacific LNG 

Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd (APLNG), our joint venture with Origin Energy Limited and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), is focused on producing CBM from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and converting the CBM into LNG. Natural gas is sold to domestic customers, while LNG is exported. Origin operates APLNG&#146;s upstream production and pipeline system, and we operate the downstream LNG facility, located on Curtis Island near Gladstone, Queensland, as well as the LNG export sales business. 

Two fully subscribed 4.5 million tonnes-per-year LNG trains have been sanctioned. Approximately 3,900 net wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas market and the LNG sales contracts. The wells will be supported by gathering systems, central gas processing and compression stations, water treatment facilities, and a new export pipeline connecting the gas fields to the LNG facilities. APLNG Train 1 achieved first LNG in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first cargo sailed in January 2016. Train 1 LNG is being sold to Sinopec under a 20-year sales agreement for up to 4.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year. Start-up of the second LNG train is expected to occur in the second half of 2016. The resulting LNG exports from Train 2 will commence shortly thereafter. Sinopec has agreed to purchase an additional 3.3 million metric tonnes of LNG per year through 2035, and Japan-based Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. has agreed to purchase approximately 1 million metric tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years. 

APLNG has an $8.5 billion project finance facility, of which $8.4 billion had been drawn from the facility at December 31, 2015. In connection with the execution of the project financing, we provided a completion guarantee for our pro-rata share of the project finance facility until the project achieves financial completion. For additional information, see Note 4&#151;Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), Note 7&#151;Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, and Note 12&#151;Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Bayu-Undan 

The Bayu-Undan gas condensate field is located in the Timor Sea Joint Petroleum Development Area between Timor-Leste and Australia. We also operate and own a 56.9 percent interest in the associated Darwin LNG Facility, located at Wickham Point, Darwin. 

The Bayu-Undan natural gas recycle facility processes wet gas; separates, stores and offloads condensate, propane and butane; and re-injects dry gas back into the reservoir. In addition, a 310-mile natural gas pipeline connects the facility to the 3.5 million tonnes-per-year capacity Darwin LNG Facility. Produced natural gas is 

&#160;

piped to the Darwin LNG Plant, where it is converted into LNG before being transported to international markets. In 2015, we sold 174 billion gross cubic feet of LNG primarily to utility customers in Japan. 

The Bayu-Undan Phase Three Development consists of two standalone, subsea horizontal wells tied back to the existing drilling, production and processing platform. The first subsea, horizontal well commenced production in the first quarter of 2015. The well was tied back to the existing drilling, production, and processing platform. A second subsea, horizontal well was drilled, completed, then suspended due to insufficient deliverability to the platform. There are no plans to remediate nor re-drill the well in the near 

future. A continuation of Phase Three development is being evaluated, and is currently in the preliminary front-end engineering and design phase. 

ConocoPhillips served a Notice of Arbitration on the Timor-Leste Minister of Finance in October 2012 for outstanding disputes related to a series of tax assessments. The arbitration hearing was conducted in June 2014. In January 2016, the Government of Timor-Leste and ConocoPhillips reached a settlement of several significant tax disputes. However, we await the Tribunal&#146;s decision with respect to certain unresolved matters. For additional information, see Note 13&#151;Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Athena/Perseus 

The Athena production license (WA-17-L) is located offshore Western Australia and contains part of the Perseus Field which straddles the boundary with WA-1-L, an adjoining license area. Natural gas is produced from these licenses. 

Greater Sunrise 

We have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor Sea. In May 2013, the Timor-Leste Government referred a dispute with the Australian Government relating to the treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea (CMATS) to international arbitration. The CMATS arbitration does not directly impact our underlying interests in Sunrise; however, we and the Sunrise co-venturers are unable to commit to further commercial and technical work activities due to the uncertainty created by the lack of government alignment. Accordingly, current activities are restricted to compliance and social investment, as well as maintaining relationships and development options for Sunrise. 

Exploration 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Conventional Exploration We operate two exploration permits in the Browse Basin, offshore northwest Australia, in which we own a 40 percent interest in permits WA-315-P and WA-398-P, of the Greater Poseidon Area. Phase I of the Browse Basin drilling campaign in 2009/2010 resulted in three discoveries in the Greater Poseidon Area: Poseidon-1, Poseidon-2 and Kronos-1. Phase II of the drilling campaign resulted in five additional discoveries: Boreas-1, Zephyros-1, Proteus-1 SD2, Poseidon-North-1 and Pharos-1. All wells have been completed, plugged and abandoned. 

We operate two retention leases in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore northern Australia, where we own a 37.5 percent interest in leases NT/RL5 and NT/RL6, containing the Barossa and Caldita discoveries. Three appraisal wells have been drilled to further evaluate the Barossa Field&#146;s potential. The first two wells encountered hydrocarbons and the third was not commercially viable. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Unconventional Exploration In 2015, regulatory approval was received to withdraw from the four exploration permits within the Canning Basin in Western Australia. Prior to withdrawal, we owned a 46 percent working interest in each of the four permits.

&#160; We operate four production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Indonesia: the offshore South Natuna Sea Block B and three onshore PSCs, the Corridor Block and South Jambi &#147;B&#148;, both located in South Sumatra, and Kualakurun in Central Kalimantan. Currently there is production from two of these PSCs: the Corridor Block and South Natuna Sea Block B. 

South Natuna Sea Block B 

The offshore South Natuna Sea Block B PSC has 3 producing oil fields and 16 natural gas fields in various stages of development. Natural gas production is sold under international sales agreements to Malaysia and Singapore, and liquefied petroleum gas is sold locally for domestic consumption. 

South Sumatra 

The Corridor PSC consists of five oil fields and seven natural gas fields in various stages of development. Natural gas is supplied from the Grissik and Suban gas processing plants to the Duri steamflood in central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore, Batam and West Java. Production from the South Jambi &#147;B&#148; PSC has reached depletion and field development has been suspended. 

Exploration 

In 2015, we drilled and subsequently recorded dry hole expense for one exploration well in the Palangkaraya PSC. This PSC was relinquished in the third quarter of 2015. We are also in the process of relinquishing our 80 percent interest in the Warim Block PSC. We have a 60 percent working interest in the new Kualakurun PSC, located in Central Kalimantan, which was signed in May 2015. This block has an area of approximately 2 million gross acres. 

Transportation 

We are a 35 percent owner of a consortium company that has a 40 percent ownership in PT Transportasi Gas Indonesia, which owns and operates the Grissik to Duri and Grissik to Singapore natural gas pipelines.

&#160; The Penglai 19-3, 19-9 and 25-6 fields are located in Bohai Bay Block 11/05. Production from the Phase 1 development of the Penglai 19-3 Field began in 2002. Phase 2 included six additional wellhead platforms and an FPSO vessel, and was fully operational by 2009. 

&#160;

Currently, a project to add a new wellhead platform and up to 62 wells for the development of Penglai 19-9 is progressing per schedule, with first oil expected in 2017. 

We sanctioned the Penglai 19-3/19-9 Phase 3 Project in December 2015. This project will consist of three new wellhead platforms and a central processing platform. First oil from Phase 3 is expected in 2018. 

The Panyu development, located in Block 15/34 in the South China Sea, is comprised of three oil fields: Panyu 4-2, Panyu 5-1 and Panyu 11-6. The PSC for the block is scheduled to expire in September 2018, at which time we will relinquish all working interest in the block. 

Exploration 

In 2015, we participated in two successful appraisal wells in the Penglai fields, which will be used to support future development plans.

&#160; We own interests in four deepwater PSCs in Malaysia. Three are located off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah: Block G, Block J and the Kebabangan Cluster (KBBC). Our fourth PSC, deepwater Block 3E, is located off the Malaysian state of Sarawak. 

Block G 

We have a 21 percent interest in the unitized Siakap North-Petai oil field, which began producing in the first quarter of 2014 and reached its estimated net annual peak production of 5 MBOED in 2015. Development of the Malikai oil field is underway with first production anticipated in 2017. We own a 35 percent interest in the Malikai and Pisagan discoveries. 

Block J 

First production for Gumusut occurred from an early production system in 2012. Production from a permanent, semi-submersible floating production vessel was achieved in October 2014, with estimated net annual peak production of 32 MBOED anticipated in 2016. Unitization of the Gumusut Field with Brunei was recorded in 2014 and reduced our ownership interest from 33 percent to an initial 29 percent. A final ownership split is expected to be agreed in 2016. 

We own a 40 percent interest in the Limbayong discovery. The Limbayong-2 appraisal well, located approximately seven miles from Gumusut, was drilled in 2013 and resulted in an oil discovery. Development options are being evaluated. 

KBBC 

We own a 30 percent interest in the KBBC PSC. Development of the KBB gas field commenced in 2011, and first production was achieved in November 2014. Gas sales are currently constrained due to repairs on a third party pipeline. Estimated net annual peak production of 26 MBOED is expected in 2018. Kamunsu East is being evaluated for development options. 

&#160;

Exploration 

We relinquished our 40 percent operating interest in SB-311, an exploration block encompassing 259,000 gross acres offshore Sabah, in December 2015. Both wells drilled in 2015 as part of our two-well commitment program were expensed as dry holes in the second and third quarters of 2015. 

We own a 50 percent operating interest in deepwater Block 3E, which encompasses approximately 480,000 gross acres offshore Sarawak. Seismic processing was completed in 2015 and drilling is planned for 2016-2017. 

Bangladesh 

Exploration 

In 2014, we relinquished our interest in two deepwater blocks in the Bay of Bengal, Blocks 10 and 11. In 2015, we also opted not to pursue our interest in three adjoining deepwater blocks and exited operations in Bangladesh. 

Brunei 

Exploration 

We have a 6.25 percent working interest in the deepwater Block CA-2 PSC, which has an exploration period through December 2018. Exploration has been ongoing since September 2011, with natural gas discovered at the Kelidang NE-1 and Keratau-1 wells in 2013 and at the Keratau SW-1 well in 2015. Evaluation of the results is ongoing.

&#160; QG3 is an integrated development jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent), ConocoPhillips (30 percent) and Mitsui &#38; Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). QG3 consists of upstream natural gas production facilities, which produce approximately 1.4 billion gross cubic feet per day of natural gas from Qatar&#146;s North Field over a 25 year life, in addition to a 7.8 million gross tonnes-per-year LNG facility. LNG is shipped in leased LNG carriers destined for sale globally. 

QG3 executed the development of the onshore and offshore assets as a single integrated development with Qatargas 4 (QG4), a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell plc. This included the joint development of offshore facilities situated in a common offshore block in the North Field, as well as the construction of two identical LNG process trains and associated gas treating facilities for both the QG3 and QG4 joint ventures. Production from the LNG trains and associated facilities is combined and shared.

Angola 

Exploration 

We have a 50 percent operating interest in Block 36 and a 30 percent operating interest in Block 37, both of which are located in Angola&#146;s subsalt play trend. The two blocks total approximately 2.5 million gross acres and each block was awarded with a two-well work program commitment. We secured a rig for a four-well commitment program and commenced drilling in the second quarter of 2014. In November 2014, we plugged and abandoned the Kamoxi-1 exploration well, located in Block 36 offshore Angola, as a dry hole. We also subsequently plugged and abandoned the Omosi-1 and Vali-1 wells as dry holes in adjacent Block 37 in the first and second quarters of 2015, respectively, and recorded an after-tax impairment of $75 million associated with our Angola Block 37 leasehold in the second quarter of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded $335 million in after-tax charges for the impairment, dry hole costs and future potential obligations associated with our Angola Block 36 leasehold. The Athena drilling rig, secured for our four-well commitment program, was mobilized to Senegal in October. 

Senegal 

Exploration 

We have a 35 percent working interest in three exploration blocks offshore Senegal. In October 2014, we discovered a working petroleum system at the FAN-1 exploration well. In addition, in November 2014 we confirmed oil was discovered in the SNE-1 well, the second of the two-well program. We spud the SNE-2 and SNE-3 appraisal wells in the fourth quarter of 2015. We have the option to become operator of the project if it advances to development. 

Azerbaijan 

Transportation 

The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline transports crude oil from the Caspian Region through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey for tanker loadings at the port of Ceyhan. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we finalized the sale of our 2.5 percent interest in BTC. 

Poland 

Exploration 

In the second quarter of 2015, we decided not to conduct further activity on our three Baltic Basin concessions, which encompassed approximately 500,000 gross acres. As a result, we recorded an after-tax impairment of $32 million, net of other deductions. 

&#160;

Colombia 

Unconventional Exploration 

We have an 80 percent operated interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin block VMM-3. The block extends over 66,649 net acres and contains the Picoplata-1, which completed drilling in 2015. Continued evaluation and testing of the well is planned in 2016. 

We hold 70 percent nonoperated interests in the deep rights in the Santa Isabel Block in the Middle Magdalena Basin, which covers approximately 71,000 net acres. We also hold a 30 percent nonoperated interest in the VMM27 and VMM28 blocks, in the Middle Magdalena Basin, which are currently in the process of being relinquished. 

Chile 

Exploration 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we received approval from the Chilean government to become a 5 percent interest holder in the Coiron Block. Empresa Nacional del Petroleo holds the remaining 95 percent interest and is the operator of the block. 

Venezuela 

In October 2014, we filed for arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the Venezuela state oil company, for contractual compensation related to the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects. The ICC arbitration is a separate and independent legal action from the investment treaty arbitration against the government of Venezuela, which is currently proceeding before an arbitral tribunal under the World Bank&#146;s International Centre for Settlement for Investment Disputes (ICSID). The ICSID Tribunal is determining the damages owed to ConocoPhillips as a result of Venezuela&#146;s unlawful expropriation of ConocoPhillips&#146; significant oil investments in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy crude oil projects and the offshore Corocoro development project in June 2007. For additional information, see Note 13&#151;Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Ecuador 

In December 2012, an ICSID Tribunal issued a decision on liability in favor of Burlington Resources, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, finding that Ecuador&#146;s seizure of Blocks 7 and 21 was an unlawful expropriation in violation of the Ecuador-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty. An additional arbitration phase to determine the damages owed to ConocoPhillips for Ecuador&#146;s actions and to address Ecuador&#146;s counterclaims followed the decision on liability and we are now waiting for the Tribunal&#146;s award. For additional information, see Note 13&#151;Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

OTHER 

Marketing Activities 

Our Commercial organization manages our worldwide commodity portfolio, which mainly includes natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, natural gas liquids and LNG. Marketing activities are performed through offices in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. In marketing our production, we attempt to minimize flow disruptions, maximize realized prices and manage credit-risk exposure. Commodity sales are generally made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale. We also purchase and sell third-party volumes to better position the company to satisfy customer demand while fully utilizing transportation and storage capacity. 

Natural Gas 

Our natural gas production, along with third-party purchased gas, is primarily marketed in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. Our natural gas is sold to a diverse client portfolio which includes local distribution companies; gas and power utilities; large industrials; independent, integrated or state-owned oil and gas companies; as well as marketing companies. To reduce our market exposure and credit risk, we also transport natural gas via firm and interruptible transportation agreements to major market hubs. 

Crude Oil, Bitumen and Natural Gas Liquids 

Our crude oil, bitumen and natural gas liquids revenues are derived from production in the United States, Canada, Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe. These commodities are primarily sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, adjusted for location, quality and transportation. 

LNG 

LNG marketing efforts are focused on equity LNG production facilities located in Alaska, Australia, and Qatar. LNG is primarily sold under long-term contracts with prices based on market indices. 

Energy Partnerships 

Marine Well Containment Company 

We are a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC), a non-profit organization formed in 2010, which provides well containment equipment and technology in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In January 2015, MWCC announced acceptance of its expanded containment system (ECS). The ECS complements the capabilities and capacities put into place with its interim containment system, which the industry has been relying on since 2011. Equipment from both systems has been combined to form MWCC&#146;s containment system, which meets the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement requirements for a subsea well containment system that can respond to a deepwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

Subsea Well Response Project 

In 2011, we, along with several leading oil and gas companies, launched the Subsea Well Response Project (SWRP), a non-profit organization based in Stavanger, Norway, which was created to enhance the industry&#146;s capability to respond to international subsea well control incidents. Through collaboration with Oil Spill Response Limited, a non-profit organization in the United Kingdom, subsea well intervention equipment is available for the industry to use in the event of a subsea well incident. This complements the work being undertaken in the United States by MWCC. 

Oil Spill Response Removal Organizations (OSROs) 

We maintain memberships in several OSROs across the globe as a key element of our preparedness program in addition to internal response resources. Many of the OSROs are not-for-profit cooperatives owned by the member companies wherein we may actively participate as a member of the board of directors, steering committee, work group or other supporting role. Globally, our primary OSRO is Oil Spill Response Ltd. based in the U.K., with facilities in several other countries and the ability to respond anywhere in the world. In North America, our primary OSROs include the Marine Spill Response Corporation for the continental U.S. and Alaska Clean Seas and Ship Escort/Response Vessel System for the Alaska North Slope and Prince 

&#160;

William Sound, respectively. We are also a member of the Cook Inlet Spill Prevention and Response, Inc. Internationally, we maintain memberships in various regional OSROs including the Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies, Australian Marine Oil Spill Center and Petroleum Industry of Malaysia Mutual Aid Group. 

Technology 

Our Technology organization has several technology programs, which focus on areas to support our business growth plans: developing unconventional reservoirs, producing oil sands and heavy oil economically with fewer emissions, improving the economic efficiency of our LNG and other gas solutions technologies, increasing recoveries from our legacy fields, and implementing sustainability measures. 

Our Optimized Cascade &#174; LNG liquefaction technology business continues to be successful with the demand for new LNG plants. The technology has been licensed for use in 25 LNG trains around the world, with feasibility studies ongoing for additional trains. 

RESERVES 

We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2015. No difference exists between our estimated total proved reserves for year-end 2014 and year-end 2013, which are shown in this filing, and estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2015. 

DELIVERY COMMITMENTS 

We sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our Commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 2.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, including approximately 430 billion cubic feet related to the noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and 230 million barrels of crude oil in the future. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2028. We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with proved developed reserves. In addition, we anticipate using proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases to fulfill any remaining commitments. See the disclosure on &#147;Proved Undeveloped Reserves&#148; in the &#147;Oil and Gas Operations&#148; section following the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information on the development of proved undeveloped reserves. 

COMPETITION 

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the E&#38;P business. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our segments is highly competitive, with no single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominating. 

We compete with numerous other companies in the industry, including state-owned companies, to locate and obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil, bitumen, natural gas liquids and natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on statistics published in the September 7, 2015, issue of the Oil and Gas Journal , we were the third-largest U.S.-based oil and gas company in worldwide liquids and natural gas production and reserves in 2014. We deliver our production into the worldwide commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; economic analysis in connection with portfolio management; and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. 

&#160;

Company-sponsored research and development activities charged against earnings were $222 million, $263 million and $258 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Health, Safety and Environment 

Our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) organization provides tools and support to our business units and staff groups to help them ensure world class health, safety and environmental performance. The framework through which we safely manage our operations, the HSE Management System Standard, emphasizes process safety, risk management, emergency preparedness and environmental performance, with an intense focus on process and occupational safety. In support of the goal of zero incidents, HSE milestones and criteria are established annually to drive strong safety performance. Progress toward these milestones and criteria are measured and reported. HSE audits are conducted on business functions periodically, and improvement actions are established and tracked to completion. We also have detailed processes in place to address sustainable development in our economic, environmental and social performance. Our processes, related tools and requirements focus on water, biodiversity and climate change, as well as social and stakeholder issues.
