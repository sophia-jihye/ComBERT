 Item 1. BUSINESS Corporate History 

General 

Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 24, 2013 with the name &#147;Marika Inc.&#148; On December 17, 2014, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH (&#147;Pieris GmbH&#148;) and the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH entered into an Acquisition Agreement, or the Acquisition Agreement. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the stockholders of Pieris GmbH contributed all of their equity interests in Pieris GmbH to Pieris in exchange for shares of Pieris common stock, which resulted in Pieris GmbH becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris, which we refer to as the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, as defined below, Pieris pursued a business of an errand concierge service online marketplace. 

On December 5, 2014, Pieris completed a 2.272727-for-1 forward split of its common stock in the form of a share dividend, with the result that 6,100,000 shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the stock split became 13,863,647 shares of common stock outstanding immediately thereafter. On December 16, 2014, prior to the closing of the Acquisition, Pieris amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation to, among other things, change its name from Marika Inc. to &#147;Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,&#148; and increase its authorized capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of &#147;blank check&#148; preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. 

On December 17, 2014, Pieris, Pieris GmbH and the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH entered into an Acquisition Agreement, or the Acquisition Agreement. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the stockholders of Pieris GmbH contributed all of their equity interests in Pieris GmbH to Pieris in exchange for shares of Pieris common stock, which resulted in Pieris GmbH becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris, which we refer to as the Acquisition. The Acquisition closed on December 17, 2014. 

In connection with the Acquisition and pursuant to a Split-Off Agreement, dated December 17, 2014 among Pieris, Marika Enterprises Inc. and Aleksandrs Sviks, or the Split-Off Agreement, and a general release agreement, Pieris transferred its pre-Acquisition assets and liabilities to its former majority stockholder, Aleksandrs Sviks, in exchange for the surrender by him and cancellation of 11,363,635 shares of Pieris common stock, or the Split-Off. Upon the closing of the Acquisition and the Split-Off, Pieris discontinued its pre-Acquisition business plans and is now pursuing only the business of Pieris GmbH. 

Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Pieris ceased to be a &#147;shell company&#148; under applicable rules of the SEC. On December 17, 2014, in connection with the Acquisition, our Board of Directors changed our fiscal year from a fiscal year ending on June 30 to one ending on December 31 of each year, which was the fiscal year of Pieris GmbH. 

On December 17, 2014, Pieris entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the Securities Purchase Agreement, with certain accredited investors, or the Investors, providing for the issuance and sale to such investors of an aggregate of 6,779,510 shares of our common stock in a private placement offering conducted through a series of closings occurring on December 17, 18 and 23, 2014, at a purchase price per share of $2.00 and for aggregate gross proceeds to us of $13.56 million, or the Private Placement. After deducting for placement agent and other fees and expenses, the aggregate net proceeds from the Private Placement were $12.04 million. Northland Securities, Inc. and Katalyst Securities, LLC served as co-exclusive placement agents, or the Placement Agents, for the Private Placement. 

&#160;

At the closings of the Private Placement we issued to the Placement Agents and their designees, warrants, or the Placement Warrants, to acquire up to 542,360 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. Each of the Placement Warrants is exercisable at any time at the option of the holder until the five-year anniversary of its date of issuance. 

In connection with the Private Placement, we also entered into a registration rights agreement, or the Registration Rights Agreement, with the Investors, the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH and the holders of Placement Warrants. Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company agreed to file with the SEC, within 90 days following December 17, 2014, a registration statement to register for resale all of the 6,779,510 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock issued in the Private Placement, as well as an additional 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which the Company issued to former stockholders of Pieris GmbH in connection with the closing of the Acquisition, and an additional 542,360 shares of common stock issuable to holders of the Placement Warrants. The registration statement was effective on May 11, 2015. If the registration statement ceases to be effective during the required effectiveness period, except as permitted under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will be obligated pay to each selling stockholder an amount in cash equal to 1.0% of the value of such selling stockholder&#146;s shares of outstanding common stock on every monthly anniversary of such failure and prorated for any portion of a month, until it is cured or all of such selling stockholder&#146;s securities to be registered hereunder have been or may be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144. Furthermore, if the Company fails to timely file reports required to be filed by us pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Company will be obligated pay to each selling stockholder an amount in cash equal to 1.0% of the value of such selling stockholder&#146;s shares of outstanding common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will not be obligated to make any such payments with respect to any of the securities to be registered thereunder that we are unable to register due to limits imposed by the SEC&#146;s interpretation of Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, subject to exception in certain circumstances or pursuant to the Acquisition, as applicable, we have agreed to keep such registration statement effective until the later of December 17, 2016 and such time as all of the securities to be registered thereunder have been sold under the registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144 or may be sold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144. If there is not an effective registration statement covering the resale of the securities to be registered by such registration statement at any time prior to December 17, 2015, then the selling stockholders will have &#147;piggyback&#148; registration rights with respect to any such securities that are not eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 without volume or manner of sale restrictions in connection with any other registration statement we determine to file that would permit the inclusion of those shares. 

On July 6, 2015 we closed a public offering of an aggregate of 9,090,909 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $2.75 per share. On July 24, 2015 the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option to purchase 1,211,827 additional shares of our common stock at the public offering price of $2.75, the sale of which closed on July 28, 2015. Gross proceeds raised by the Company in the offering, including the exercise of the over-allotment option, were $28.3 million and net of equity issuance costs are $25.8 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund research and development, including preclinical and clinical research and development of our drug candidates, working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a holding company and the sole stockholder of Pieris GmbH. The corporate headquarters and research facility of Pieris GmbH are located in Freising, Germany. Pieris Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris GmbH, was formed on February 14, 2014 to conduct research and development in Australia. 

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, establishes a class of company called an &#147;emerging growth company,&#148; which generally is a company whose initial public offering was completed after December 8, 2011 and had total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed 

&#160;

fiscal year. Additionally, Section 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, establishes a class of company called a &#147;smaller reporting company,&#148; which generally is a company with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, if such public float is $0, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. We currently qualify as both an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company. 

As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain extended accounting standards and exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not available to public reporting companies that do not qualify for those classifications, including without limitation the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; An emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public reporting companies. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; An emerging growth company is exempt from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor&#146;s report providing additional information about the audit and financial statements, commonly known as an &#147;auditor discussion and analysis.&#148; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; An emerging growth company is not required to hold nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation or any golden parachute payments not previously approved by stockholders. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Neither an emerging growth company nor a smaller reporting company is required to comply with the requirement of auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting, which is required for other public reporting companies by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A company that is either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company is eligible for reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic and annual reports, including without limitation exemption from the requirement to provide a compensation discussion and analysis describing compensation practices and procedures. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; A company that is either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company is eligible for reduced financial statement disclosure in its registration statements, which must include two years of audited financial statements rather than the three years of audited financial statements that are required for other public reporting companies. Smaller reporting companies are also eligible to provide such reduced financial statement disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-K. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company and/or a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of those respective classifications. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2019, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under applicable SEC rules. We expect that we will remain an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future, but cannot retain our emerging growth company status indefinitely and will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company on or before December 31, 2019. We will remain a smaller reporting company until we have a public float of $75 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we could retain our smaller reporting company status indefinitely depending on the size of our public float. 

&#160;

Business Overview 

We are a clinical stage biotechnology company that discovers and develops Anticalin-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in a unique and transformative way. Our pipeline includes immuno-oncology multi-specifics tailored for the tumor micro-environment, an inhaled Anticalin to treat uncontrolled asthma and a half-life-optimized Anticalin to treat anemia. Our proprietary Anticalins are a novel class of protein therapeutics validated in the clinic and by partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies. 

Anticalin &#174; proteins are a class of low molecular-weight therapeutic proteins derived from lipocalins, which are naturally occurring low-molecular weight human proteins typically found in blood plasma and other bodily fluids. Anticalin &#174; -branded proteins function similarly to monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, by binding tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. An antibody is a large protein used by the immune system that recognizes a unique part of a foreign target molecule, called an antigen. We believe Anticalin proteins possess numerous advantages over antibodies in certain applications. For example, Anticalin proteins are small in size and are monomeric, meaning single protein units rather than a multi-protein complex. Therefore, we believe Anticalins are generally more stable biophysically than tetrameric monoclonal antibodies, composed of four protein subunits, potentially enabling unique routes of drug administration such as pulmonary delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities such as antibodies are often too large to be delivered effectively through these methods. In addition, Anticalin proteins are monovalent in structure, which means they bind to a single cell surface receptor and which may avoid the risk of cross-linking of cell surface receptors where such receptors are a therapeutic target. Antibody-mediated cross-linking can occur when each of the two &#147;arms&#148; of an antibody binds to a cell surface receptor and brings these receptors into close proximity, which can lead to aggressive cell growth that is characteristic of cancer. While our basic Anticalin proteins have only a single binding site and are not subject to such cross-linking, our Anticalin-branded technology is also modular, which allows us to design Anticalin proteins to bind with specificity to multiple targets at the same time. This multispecificity offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Moreover, unlike antibodies, the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of Anticalin proteins can be adjusted to potentially enable program-specific optimal drug exposure. Such differentiating characteristics suggest that Anticalin proteins have the potential, in certain cases, to become first-in-class drugs. 

We have access to intellectual property rights directed to various aspects of our Anticalin &#174; technology platform, allowing for development and advancement of our platform and drug candidates. We believe our ownership and/or license of our Anticalin platform provides us with a strong intellectual property position, particularly where we are seeking to address targets and diseases in a novel way and for which there is existing monoclonal antibody intellectual property. 

Our core Anticalin &#174; technology and platform were developed in Germany, and we have collaboration arrangements with major multi-national pharmaceutical companies headquartered in the U.S., Europe and Japan and with regional pharmaceutical companies headquartered in India. These include existing agreements with Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, or Daiichi Sankyo, and Sanofi Group, or Sanofi, pursuant to which our Anticalin platform has consistently achieved its development milestones. Furthermore, we established a collaboration with F.Hoffmann&#151;La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann&#151;La Roche Inc., or Roche in December 2015. We have discovery and preclinical collaboration and service agreements with both academic institutions and private firms in Australia, which increasingly are being handled through Pieris Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris. 

We believe that the drug-like properties of the Anticalin &#174; drug class were demonstrated in Phase Ia/Ib clinical trials with our two Anticalin-branded drug candidates PRS-080 and PRS-050. Our anti-VEGF-A drug candidate, PRS-050, designed to inhibit blood vessel growth in solid tumors, was investigated in solid tumor patients. VEGF-A is a protein that induces growth of blood vessels, and anti-VEGF-A drug aim to inhibit the blood supply to solid tumors. In a phase Ib multi-ascending dose trial performed under governance by the German Federal 

&#160;

Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ( Bundesinstitut f&#252;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM ), PRS-050 was shown to be generally safe and well-tolerated, and we were not able to detect any anti-drug antibodies, or ADAs, following administration of a total of 144 doses with five or more doses to 17 patients. We believe that these results demonstrated that there was no apparent immune response against PRS-050. Furthermore, dose-proportional PKs, pharmacology and biomarker activity were observed in the trial, which we believe demonstrates that PRS-050 engaged with its intended target VEGF-A in those patients. Despite these results, we, decided not to advance PRS-050 based on our belief that PRS-050&#146;s mode of action (the way in which it functions in the body, namely, antagonizing VEGF-A) was not sufficiently differentiated over the modes of action of already-marketed therapies, such as bevacizumab and aflibercept, to create enough economic value in the drug market to support continued development of PRS-050 as a competitive product candidate. While we have not advanced development of PRS-050 since that time for the aforementioned strategic and business reasons, we believe that the positive results from this clinical trial generally support continued investment in our Anticalin drug candidates. 

Our current development plans focus mainly on three drug candidates, PRS-080, PRS-060 and our PRS-300 series. 

PRS-080 is an Anticalin &#174; protein that binds to hepcidin, a natural regulator of iron in the blood. An excess amount of hepcidin can cause functional iron deficiency, or FID, which often cannot be treated adequately with iron supplements and can lead to anemia. PRS-080 has been designed to target hepcidin for the treatment of FID in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, particularly in end-stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis. We believe that by blocking the actions of hepcidin, PRS-080 will serve to address anemia by mobilizing iron for incorporation into red blood cells. Furthermore, we engineered PRS-080 to have a half-life of less than a week, so that following administration, it is expected to clear from the human body in a much shorter timeframe than antibodies, which typically have a half-life of two weeks or greater. We believe a shorter residence time in the body may be a superior approach for countering excess hepcidin, as physiological levels of hepcidin in these patients are relatively high (nanomolar concentration), and in theory such high concentrations will quickly saturate an administered binding drug. As a result, frequent administration of a drug may be required in order to sufficiently antagonize, or suppress the effect of, the target. The longer residence time of a mAb, could lead to the accumulation of both the drug and the target beyond the typical residence time of hepcidin, resulting in large quantities of hepcidin bound to mAbs. PRS-080 was investigated in a single-ascending dose Phase Ia trial in healthy subjects under governance by the BfArM. This study demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability of PRS-080 as well as dose-proportional pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetics. The inhibition of hepcidin and the subsequent change in parameters of iron metabolism such as the increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation confirmed the mode of action of PRS-080. This study was completed in 2015. The next phase of clinical development is a Phase Ib study in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis, which commenced in the first quarter of 2016 and is expected to be completed in 2016 in order to study safety and pharmacological activity in CKD patients. 

The second Anticalin &#174; drug candidate, PRS-060, binds to the IL-4 receptor alpha-chain (IL-4RA), thereby inhibiting the actions of IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines (small proteins mediating signaling between cells within the human body) known to be key mediators in the inflammatory cascade that causes asthma and other inflammatory diseases. The small size and biophysical stability of PRS-060 enables direct delivery to the lungs, such as through the use of an inhaler, which we believe will enable high pulmonary concentrations of the drug candidate to be achieved at substantially lower doses than would be reached with antibodies that are systemically delivered. Further, PRS-060 has a short systemic residence time which we believe may avoid undesired target engagement outside of the desired area in the lungs. PRS-060 is currently undergoing IND-enabling activities, and we intend to begin a Phase I clinical trial with PRS-060 in 2017. 

The third Anticalin &#174; -based drug candidate, PRS-343, is a bispecific protein targeting the immune receptor CD137 and the tumor target HER2. PRS-343 is the result of a genetic fusion of a variant of the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab with an Anticalin specific for CD137. The mode of action of this CD137/ HER2 bispecific 

&#160;

is to promote CD137 clustering by bridging CD137-positive T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. PRS-343 is intended to localize CD137 activation in the tumor, and to thereby both increase efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity compared to CD137-targeting antibodies being developed by third parties in clinical trials. 

PRS-343 is a member of our second set of oncology drug candidates known as the 300-Series &#147;platform within a product&#148; opportunity in immuno-oncology. The 300-Series Anticalin &#174; proteins target checkpoint or, like PRS-343, immune-stimulatory proteins and define a variety of multifunctional biotherapeutics that genetically link two distinct Anticalin proteins together or an antibody with one or more Anticalin proteins, thereby constituting a multispecific protein. Checkpoint proteins are proteins that help the development of an immune response or downregulate the response, for example when an infection is eliminated while co-stimulatory proteins (e.g. CD-137) upregulate the immune response. 

Strategy 

Our goal is to become a fully integrated biotechnology company by discovering and developing Anticalin &#174; based therapeutics to target validated disease pathways in a unique and transformative way, and later developing and commercializing our products. We intend to take advantage of our operational experience in technology development and our history of successful partnerships and collaborations to pursue additional partnerships that will help provide us the experience we need to bring Anticalinbased drug candidates to market in a number of indications. We intend to engage with partners for many of our programs in a combination of geographic and indication-based arrangements to maximize our business opportunities. We also intend to retain certain development and commercial rights on selected products as our experience in drug development grows. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Continue to build our platform by entering into new partnerships and license and collaborative arrangements and advancing our currently-partnered programs. We have entered into partnership and collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies in a diverse range of therapeutic areas and geographies. We have active partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies, such as Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo and Roche. Together with our partners, we intend to advance multiple drug candidates through preclinical studies and to select further drug candidates for clinical development in the future. We will also continue to seek to engage with new pharmaceutical partners that can contribute funding, experience and marketing ability for the successful development and commercialization of our current and future drug candidates. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advance PRS-080 in clinical trials in anemia patients. PRS-080 was investigated in a single-ascending dose Phase Ia trial in healthy subjects in 2015 under governance by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices ( Bundesinstitut f&#252;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM ). This study demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability of PRS-080 as well as dose-proportional pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetics. The inhibition of hepcidin and the subsequent change in parameters of iron metabolism such as the increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation confirmed the mode of action of PRS-080. The next phase of clinical development, has commenced in the first quarter of 2016, is a Phase Ib study in CKD patients suffering from FID-anemia, which is expected to be completed in 2016 to study safety and pharmacological activity in CKD patients. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advance PRS-060 through IND-enabling studies and subsequently into first-in-man trial. We have a strong preclinical pipeline of Anticalin drug candidates in diverse indications such as severe asthma (PRS-060) and immuno-oncology (PRS-343). We will continue to move forward with preclinical and discovery work on these drug candidates with the goal of advancement into clinical trials on a data-driven basis. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advance PRS-343 through IND-enabling studies and subsequently into first-in-patient trial. IND-enabling studies are underway with Good Manufacturing Practice (&#147;GMP&#148;) and preclinical toxicology scheduled for 2016. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursue and broaden opportunities for our Anticalin technology. We intend to continue to identify, vet and pursue opportunities to develop novel Anticalin therapeutics for oncology, pulmonary disease and a variety of additional diseases, as we continue to improve on the Anticalin platform technology. Anticalin platform technology 

Our platform technology focuses on low molecular-weight Anticalin &#174; proteins that bind tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. Anticalin proteins are derived from human proteins called lipocalins, which are naturally occurring low-molecular weight human proteins of approximately 18 to 20kDA molecular mass typically found in blood plasma and other bodily fluids. The lipocalin class of proteins defines a group of extracellular specific-binding proteins that, collectively, exhibit extremely high structural homology, yet have an uncharacteristically low amino acid sequence identity (less than 20%), making them attractive &#147;templates&#148; for amino acid diversification. Lipocalins naturally bind to, store and transport a wide spectrum of molecules. The defining attributes of the 12-member human lipocalin class and, by extension, Anticalin proteins, engineered from the lipocalin class of proteins, are a four-loop variable region and a rigidly conserved beta-barrel backbone, which, together, form a cup-like binding pocket. The below graphic shows both tear (left) and NGAL (right) lipocalins together with their natural ligands. 

&#160;

Anticalin &#174; proteins are created from either tear lipocalin, found in human tear fluid, or NGAL lipocalin, a protein involved in the innate immune system, by making discreet mutations in the genetic code for the binding regions. These mutations have the potential to lead to highly specific, high-affinity binding for both small and large molecular targets. Random mutations are introduced at pre-defined positions involved in endogenous ligand engagement, creating exponentially diverse pools of Anticalin proteins, the most potent and well behaved of which are selected and optimized in a customized manner through in vitro selection. Using techniques such as phage display, a successful technique in antibody-based drug discovery, to build and refine antibody libraries, the ability to introduce diversity and then select for the best binders among a large pool of Anticalin proteins gives us the opportunity to select Anticalin proteins for a wide variety of targets. The flexibility inherent in the Anticalin proteins&#146; cup-like structure allows us to choose both small-molecule targets that fit inside the &#145;cup&#146; as well as larger protein targets that can be bound by the Anticalin proteins&#146; outward-facing arms. Our Phase Ia/Ib trial for PRS-080 and PRS-050 indicated that Anticalin proteins may be non-immunogenic and thereby have the potential to exhibit a favorable safety profile. 

&#160;

The below graphic demonstrates Anticalin &#174; drug candidates binding to a small molecule (left), a small protein target (hepcidin, center) and a large protein target (CTLA4, right): 

&#160;

To obtain a specific Anticalin &#174; protein, we take advantage of the breadth of our proprietary Anticalin libraries, generated through our protein engineering expertise. We have created, and will continue to create, proprietary Anticalin libraries by rationally diversifying the lipocalin regions that are responsible for ligand binding, applying different libraries to different types of targets. By utilizing bacterial production from the earliest stages of drug discovery through Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, manufacturing, we have created a seamless platform that improves the quality, yield and cost-effectiveness of our drug candidates. However, Anticalin protein manufacturing is not limited to bacterial systems, with the underlying expression system being driven on a program-by-program basis. See &#147;&#151;Manufacturing&#148; below. 

As targeted, protein-based molecules, Anticalin &#174; proteins also function similarly to monoclonal antibodies, thereby offering many of the same favorable qualities, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; High specificity to their targets . Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins can bind their targets without binding other molecules, even molecules with very similar chemical structures or amino acid sequences, allowing for more effective treatments through, for example, minimizing off-target effects. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tight binding and effective biological activity at their targets . Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins are able to bind their targets at subnanomolar affinities. Anticalin proteins can potentially achieve desirable biological effects by inhibiting an undesired or inducing a desired cell activity by binding to cell-surface receptors or their ligands. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Human origin . Like many monoclonal antibodies in development and marketed today, Anticalin proteins are derived from a natural class of circulating human proteins. Their human origin increases the likelihood that Anticalin proteins will not be recognized as foreign by the immune system and subsequently rejected. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Scalability for large scale production . Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins lend themselves to large-scale production, yet can also be produced in a range of expression systems ranging from prokaryotic (bacterial) to eukaryotic (animal, plant, fungal) cells. Anticalin proteins can take advantage of several well-understood and widely practiced methods of protein production both in small amounts for preclinical testing and at larger scale for clinical trials and commercial production. While often compared to monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin &#174; proteins, we believe, offer several advantages over antibodies, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Small size and biophysical stability . Anticalin proteins are small in size and are monomeric. Therefore, we believe Anticalins are generally more stable biophysically than tetrameric monoclonal antibodies, potentially enabling unique routes of administration to target diseases, such as pulmonary delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities such as antibodies are often too large to be delivered effectively through these methods. We believe Anticalin proteins will also be less expensive to manufacture than 

&#160;

&#160; antibodies due to their lower molecular weight and less bulky structure as well as the ability to use the prokaryotic-based manufacturing systems, a less costly manufacturing system than mammalian cell-based manufacturing systems. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Optimization of half-life . Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have a half-life that is optimal for the indication area and a desired dosing schedule. Antibodies typically have half-lives of two weeks or longer, whereas Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have half-lives from hours to weeks, depending on the half-life extension technology employed, if any. This optionality allows us to exert greater control over the amount of circulating Anticalin protein in the blood and the amount of time such Anticalin proteins circulate in the blood, depending on the underlying biology we are trying to address. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Modular platform for higher-order multispecificity and avoidance of cross-linking . Our Anticalin technology is modular, allowing for monovalent or multivalent target engagement, including multispecificity within a single protein. We believe that a monovalent &#147;backbone&#148; is an advantage in situations where pure antagonism of certain cellular receptors is desired. The dual-binding nature of monoclonal antibodies, which have two &#147;arms,&#148; can be a disadvantage in cases when the antibodies bind to and cross-link cell-surface receptors. Such cross-linking often leads to undesirable activation of the cells bearing those receptors. Single-action (monovalent) Anticalin proteins have only a single binding site and are thus not subject to cross-linking. Further, when it is called for by the biology we are addressing, we can create multispecific Anticalin proteins that can simultaneously bind (i) two or more different targets or (ii) different epitopes, the specific piece of an antigen to which an antibody binds, on the same target by genetically linking Anticalin proteins with distinct specificities on a common cDNA strand. We believe this multispecificity offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Unique Anticalin proteins can be pieced together and undergo simultaneous target engagement as a single fusion protein, without generally compromising on manufacturability. We believe that drug-like properties of the Anticalin &#174; drug class were demonstrated for PRS-050, our anti-VEGF-A Anticalin-branded drug candidate designed to inhibit blood vessel growth in solid tumors, in a Phase Ib clinical trial in solid tumor patients. Although we are not advancing the development of PRS-050 in oncology for strategic and business reasons, we were able to demonstrate in 26 patients with advanced solid tumors that this drug candidate engaged its target with nanomolar affinity, did not generate any detectable ADAs, and has an activity that can be confirmed by biomarker activity, target engagement assays and known on-target effects such as hypertension. In this trial, 17 patients received five or more doses of PRS-050. We believe that the positive results from the Phase Ib clinical trial for PRS-050 lends support to the future success of our drug candidates currently in development. 

PRS-080 showed excellent safety and tolerability with no infusion reactions, no signs of hypersensitive and no Severe Adverse Events in a Phase Ia trial in healthy subjects. Besides dose-proportional pharmacokinetics, pharmacologic activity confirming the mode of action of PRS-080 was demonstrated. A dose-dependent increase of the area under the serum iron concentrations was observed to a statistically significant amount compared to healthy subjects receiving placebo (P=0.0023) subsequent to reduction of hepcidin blood levels, further demonstrating the drug-like properties of the Anticalin &#174; drug class and supporting further development of PRS-080 in FID-anemic patients. 

&#160;

Implementation of our Anticalin Platform Technology: Our Drug Candidates Pipeline 

Each of our drug candidates is in the early stage of development, and we anticipate that it will likely be several years before any of our drug candidates could be commercialized. The following table summarizes the status of our current drug candidates and programs: 

&#160;

PRS-080 targeting hepcidin in CKD-related FID-anemia 

PRS-080 is an Anticalin &#174; drug candidate targeting hepcidin, a peptide mediator that is an important negative regulator of iron absorption and storage, derived from the naturally occurring human lipocalin known as NGAL. The normal function of hepcidin is to maintain equilibrium in iron supply for red blood cell production by binding to ferroportin, the protein that transports iron from the inside of a cell to the outside, inducing its internalization and subsequent degradation. The binding of hepcidin to ferroportin reduces the iron uptake from the intestine into the body and inhibits iron mobilization from cellular stores into red blood cells. An excess amount of hepcidin can cause FID, which often cannot be treated adequately with iron supplements and can lead to anemia. According to a 2009 publication by Young and Zaritsky in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, lowering hepcidin levels or antagonizing its actions would reverse the negative effects of inflammation on red blood cell formation by allowing mobilization of stored iron and improved iron absorption. 

PRS-080 has been designed to target hepcidin for the treatment of FID in anemic patients with CKD, particularly in end-stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis, to allow them to mobilize iron that is trapped in iron storage cells for use in the creation of red blood cells. We have also engineered PRS-080 to have a half-life of less than a week, so that following administration, it is expected to clear from the human body in a much shorter timeframe than antibodies, which typically have a half-life of two weeks or greater. This half-life was achieved by covalently linking PRS-080 to a specific polyethylene glycol, or PEG, in order to extend the serum half-life of the combined molecule to desirable levels. Since hepcidin is constantly produced by the body, we believe that a frequent, e.g. once per week, dosing interval will be optimally suited to interfere with hepcidin function. A half-life of about three days and a shorter residence time than mAbs is then in turn more compatible with the dosing schedule. A longer mAb-like residence time is not seen as advantageous, but rather could lead to the accumulation of both the drug and the target beyond the typical residence time of hepcidin, resulting in large quantities of hepcidin bound to mAbs. We completed a Phase Ia single-ascending dose clinical trial with PRS-080 in healthy volunteers in 2015. The trial was conducted in accordance with German law at a clinical site in Neu-Ulm, Germany, that belongs to Nuvisan GmbH, our contract research organization, or CRO. Results from 

&#160;

this trial were presented at the 2015 Annual Conference of the American Society of Hematology (http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/536). Based on the data obtained we are now continuing further development of PRS-080 in a Ib clinical study in CKD 5 patients requiring hemodialysis and which we expect to complete by the end of 2016. The data are intended to provide clinical-trial support for subsequent applications in the U.S. 

Chronic kidney disease 

According to the American Kidney Fund, approximately 31 million individuals in the United States have CKD (Stages 1-5). The proportion of CKD patients with anemia increases with the severity and stage of CKD, however according to a September 2013 competitive landscape report conducted by Tech Atlas Group, overall rates of individuals with anemia among the CKD population are approximately 30%, and according to a 2004 study by McClellan et al., Current Medical Research and Opinion, approximately 47% of the CKD patients studied were found to be anemic. Extrapolating these percentages based on the CKD population of 31 million individuals, we believe that approximately 9.3 to 14.6 million individuals in the United States with CKD are anemic. CKD (Stage 5), also known as End-Stage Renal Disease, or ESRD, is the final stage of chronic kidney disease with approximately 0.64 million patients in the US as of December 31, 2012 according the U.S. Renal Data System, USRDS 2014 Annual Data Report. The Tech Atlas Group report also estimates that approximately 70%, or approximately 0.45 million, of CKD (Stage 5) patients suffer from anemia. Anemia related to CKD is currently treated by injectable recombinant protein erythropoiesis, or red blood cell production, stimulating agents, or rESAs&#151;including Epogen, Aranesp, and Procrit&#151;with iron supplementation or a red blood cell transfusion. Based on the reported revenues of companies that market and sell rESAs, we believe that global sales of injectable rESAs were $6.3 billion in 2012, the vast majority of which were for renal indications. 

Anemia and functional iron deficiency in the CKD population 

Anemia is a serious medical condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells, and hemoglobin, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and cells throughout the body. Anemia is generally said to exist when hemoglobin is less than 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women. Anemia has a number of potential causes, including nutritional deficiencies, iron deficiency, bone marrow disease, medications, and abnormalities in production of or sensitivity to erythropoietin, a hormone that controls red blood cell production. Anemia is a frequent and severe consequence of CKD. In addition, within the CKD population, anemia may be caused by FID. FID exists when, despite adequate stores, iron cannot be mobilized for erythropoiesis. In this case, despite treatment with exogenous erythropoietin and iron supplements, iron is still deficient. FID-anemic patients can be identified and selected for therapy using marketed laboratory tests for iron metabolism. The USRDS 2014 Annual Data Report estimates that as of 2012, approximately 409,000 individuals with ESRD are presently on hemodialysis. According to the results of a 2013 research analysis conducted for us by Artisan Healthcare Consulting, which, among other things, pooled research results from nephrologists in the United States, approximately 82% of the hemodialysis patient population are anemic, and that among the anemic hemodialysis patient population, up to 23% are FID-anemic. Based on the estimated 409,000 individuals with ESRD on hemodialysis, we believe that approximately 335,000 ESRD patients on hemodialysis are anemic and approximately 0.08 million individuals are FID-anemic. 

Untreated anemia is associated with chronic fatigue, increased risk of progression of multiple diseases, and death. These morbidity and mortality risks have been clearly shown in the CKD population, where in patients age 66 and older, anemic patients with mid-stage CKD (Stage 3) have a 149% increase in cardiovascular events, and patients with severe CKD (Stage 4 and 5) have a 24% increase in cardiovascular events, in each case versus non-anemic patients in the same group, according to a paper published in 2006 in the peer-reviewed journal Blood . Similarly, compared to non-anemic patients, anemia increases the mortality rate by 199% in mid-stage CKD, and 59% in severe CKD. Successful treatment of anemia significantly improves patients&#146; quality of life, especially with respect to vitality, fatigue and physical function. In addition, patients whose anemia has been successfully treated have demonstrated lower mortality rates, less frequent hospitalization, and decreases in cardiovascular morbidity. 

&#160;

Challenges in using conventional therapy 

We believe CKD patients with FID-anemia are especially poorly served. These patients have adequate stores of iron but this iron is not efficiently incorporated into red blood cell precursors through rESAs and iron supplements. According to the 2009 publication by Young and Zaritsky in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, this imbalance in iron metabolism is a result of a high level of circulating hepcidin in the blood stream. We believe existing therapies are limited in that they do not have an impact on hepcidin or, in the case of rESAs, patients often become resistant to the therapy. 

Our potential solution: binding hepcidin with PRS-080 

We have engineered PRS-080 so that it binds to hepcidin and reduces the impact of hepcidin&#146;s negative regulation on iron mobilization. We believe that by blocking the actions of hepcidin, PRS-080 will serve to address anemia by mobilizing iron for incorporation into red blood cells. 

In patients suffering from anemia of CKD, and specifically in patients with FID, hepcidin is frequently produced by the body in abnormally large amounts. Therefore, we believe that the best way to inhibit its function is to administer an inhibitor frequently, such as once a week. Our approach will use PRS-080 in connection with a conjugated PEG30 molecule, a well-known half-life extender, potentially allowing the drug sufficient residence time. Once coupled to PEG30, PRS-080 is intended to have a half-life that will be optimally suited for dosing anemic patients with CKD. In contrast, antibodies typically have a half-life of two to three weeks. Such a long half-life renders antibodies unsuitable for frequent administration and elimination of a circulating target protein like hepcidin because such antibodies tend to accumulate the target after binding due to their own long residence time in the body with the associated risk of bound hepcidin being released by antibodies that are still circulating in the blood. 

Preclinical data 

Our preclinical studies targeted the cynomolgus monkey orthologue of hepcidin, which has a high degree of similarity (96% identity) with human hepcidin. PRS-080 was found to bind with high affinity to the cynomolgus monkey version of hepcidin. We performed a dose finding study in cynomolgus monkeys, testing intravenous 30-minute infusions as well as subcutaneous injections of PRS-080. We also carried out a 4-week repeated dose toxicology study with intravenous infusions of PRS-080 for 30 minutes every other day. Our work included toxicokinetic and ADA measurements. During the study, safety pharmacology parameters on the cardiovascular system and respiration were monitored and all safety endpoints were met. Our preclinical studies also examined a different NGAL-derived Anticalin &#174; , or surrogate molecule, which targets rat hepcidin in a rat model of inflammation-induced anemia. In these studies, administration of the surrogate molecule once per day or every other day inhibited the manifestation of anemia in the rats over the course of a three-week period. 

Hepcidin binds to ferroportin and induces its internalization and subsequent degradation, thus disabling iron mobilization from cells. PRS-080 binds strongly to hepcidin and inhibits its activity as shown in potency assays. These in vitro potency studies showed that the hepcidin-induced internalization of ferroportin is inhibited by PRS-080 in a dose-dependent manner. PRS-080 allowed for the restoration of ferroportin expression, overcoming the hepcidin-induced down-regulation, whereas NGAL alone did not have a similar effect on ferroportin expression. 

&#160;

The below chart demonstrates the percentage of expression of ferroportin, % FPN1, by PRS-080 mediated inhibition of hepcidin in an in vitro potency assay with ferroportin transfected 293 cells, wherein at 20 nM, hepcidin induces internalization of ferroportin which is reversed by PRS-080 in a dose dependent manner: 

&#160;

&#160;

We then studied the functional consequences of hepcidin inhibition on iron mobilization in cynomolgus monkeys. A dose of 1 mg/kg PRS-080 produced a robust, transient and reversible increase in total iron levels from approximately 36 &#181;M at baseline to 52 &#181;M after 8 hours. Doses higher than 1 mg/kg elevated serum iron concentrations to comparable levels and, in a dose-dependent manner, prolonged the response. A linear correlation was observed over time between the PRS-080 dose and increase of serum iron concentrations. 

The below chart shows the increase in serum iron concentrations in cynomolgus monkeys following a single intravenous administration of PRS-080 at 10 mg/kg compared to wild-type NGAL administered at the same dose: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The functional consequence of PRS-080 treatment on bone marrow activity and red blood cell production, or hematopoiesis, by means of hemoglobin, an oxygen transporting protein contained in red blood cells) concentration in reticulocytes, a precursor of red blood cells, was investigated in cynomolgus monkeys following repeated administration. As shown in the below chart, after administration of PRS-080 either intravenously (i.v. 150 mg/kg, **) or subcutaneously (s.c. 20 mg/kg, ***), elevated hemoglobin concentrations in reticulocytes (Retic CH) were observed on day 30 compared to pre-treatment (pre-dose). 

&#160;

&#160;

The PK properties of PRS-080 were investigated in cynomolgus monkeys after a single administration at doses ranging from 20 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg. The concentration over time profiles of PRS-080 showed standard drug-like properties, as the kinetics were dose proportional and there was a low volume of distribution. Elimination of PRS-080 occurred with a terminal half-life of about 2 days which can be extrapolated to translate to 3 days in humans. 

PRS-080 administration to cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated up to the highest tested dose of 120 mg/kg. This dose was classified as producing no adverse events, routine laboratory tests and blood cell examinations did not demonstrate any adverse findings and safety pharmacology investigations were without adverse events. As a result of the hepcidin inhibition, the study showed increased iron uptake and storage, for example in the liver, and mobilization. 

Phase I trial design and results 

The Phase Ia trial of PRS-080 was conducted in healthy volunteers at a clinical site in Neu-Ulm, Germany by Nuvison GmbH, a CRO. The study was a single dose escalating, blinded, placebo controlled study at a dose range from 0.2 to 40 mg/kg (equivalent to 0.08 to 16.0 mg/kg based on protein content). Forty-eight subjects were dosed with PRS-080 or a placebo. This study was governed and approved by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut f&#252;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM) and the local Ethics Committee. Treatment of subjects began at the end of 2014 and was completed in June 2015, followed by evaluation of the data. 

PRS-080 was well tolerated. All treatment emergent Adverse Events, or AEs, were either mild or moderate and no Serious AEs were observed. No association of AEs to specific organs and no apparent dose dependency or difference between placebo and active treatment was observed. Notably, no hypersensitivity or infusion reactions were noted and vital signs, body temperature and electrocardiograms were unchanged. Pharmacokinetics of PRS were dose-proportional with a half-life of approximately 3 days. PRS-080 administration resulted in an immediate decrease in plasma hepcidin concentration which was followed by an increase in serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation. The duration of this response in iron and transferrin saturation increased dose-dependently from about 18 hours at the lower dose to about 120 hours at the highest dose. 

Based on this positive safety and pharmacological activity we are advancing PRS-080 in a Phase lb study in CKD patients suffering from FID-anemia. We first plan to enroll CKD patients to study pharmacokinetics in a 

&#160;

single-dose format. We plan to subsequently dose repeatedly and study the effects of PRS-080 administration on iron mobilization and hemoglobin levels in CKD patients. 

PRS-060 targeting IL-4RA in asthma 

PRS-060 is an Anticalin &#174; drug candidate targeting IL-4RA, a cell surface receptor expressed on immune cells in the lung epithelium and mucosal layer. IL-4RA is specific to the circulating cytokines IL-4 and the closely related cytokine IL-13, both key drivers of the immune system that induce differentiation of na&#239;ve helper T cells to type 2 helper T cells, or Th2. PRS-060 is derived from human tear lipocalin, has picomolar affinity for human IL-4RA (20 pM) and has a favorable stability profile. We showed in vitro that PRS-060 can inhibit the activity of both IL-4 and IL-13. We have formulated PRS-060 for pulmonary delivery by inhalation, and we are actively preparing to carry out bioprocess optimization in preparation for cGMP, manufacturing and preclinical safety and tolerability studies. Pending the results of our preclinical studies, we intend to pursue a first-in-human clinical trial for PRS-060 in 2017. Some of the development of PRS-060 is conducted in Australia, where we intend to access leading pulmonologists for potential patient recruitment and to seek up to 40% or more in tax refunds from the Australian government in connection with research and development expenses related to PRS-060. We believe PRS-060 represents a first-in-class inhaled biologic for the treatment of asthma. 

Asthma market 

Asthma is a very common chronic airway disorder affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide according to the Global Initiative for Asthma and approximately 26 million Americans according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Of these 26 million, about 7 million are children. Asthma is responsible for 13 million physician visits a year including about 2 million emergency visits in the United States, according to the American Lung Association. In 2007 asthma was responsible for $50 billion in direct healthcare costs each year in the United States (Barnett and Nurmagambetov, 2011, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Volume 127, pp145-152). 

Challenges in using conventional therapy 

According to a 2012 Artisan Health Care Consulting analysis, as of 2011 asthma affects approximately 195 million people in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Brazil, Russia, India and China. The analysis determined that approximately 16%, or 32 million, of the group studied were considered to have moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma, while approximately 60%, or 19 million, of the group of moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma studied were considered to have moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma with an elevated Th2 signature. Inflammation brought about by Th2 immunity is addressed by standard asthma therapies. 5-10% of patients with asthma have moderate to severe disease that is not controlled with standard of care therapies. 

The current standard of care for persistent, moderate to severe allergic asthma is omalizumab (Xolair from Roche) which is given in conjunction with high dose inhaled corticosteroids often in combination with inhaled long-acting beta adrenergic agonists, or LABA. Omalizumab was approved for this condition in the United States in 2003. Outside of the United States, omalizumab is approved for severe asthma. Omalizumab works by binding to the immune mediator immunoglobulin E, or IgE, and inhibiting IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils, types of white blood cells. It has also been shown to impact some diseases, such as asthma, that are driven by eosinophils, another important class of immune cells. However, patient response to omalizumab has been shown to be inconsistent, as reported in a publication by McNicholl and Heaney in 2008 in the journal Core Evidence , which explained that in only some studies did omalizumab improve lung function. Furthermore, general asthma symptoms are also typically unaffected by omalizumab. Finally, in 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, issued a black box warning for omalizumab due to reported cases of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction suffered by some patients who had taken the drug. Despite these shortcomings, in 2012, worldwide sales of omalizumab were reported by Roche to be $1.2 billion. 

&#160;

The next generation of therapies beyond omalizumab targets a broader range than just IgE mediated mechanisms. These approaches target other immune mediators, including IL-5, IL-4 and IL-13 (which act in concert on eosinophils, B-cells, epithelial cells, goblet cells and others) and CRTH2. Asthma is associated with high levels of eosinophils, immune cells that play a role in protecting the body against infection. The creation of eosinophils can be interrupted at the early stages, while the cells are still maturing. Multiple products are in development that target eosinophils and GlaxoSmithKline&#146;s, or GSK, mepolizumab which targets IL-5 was approved for severe eosinophilic asthma in adults and children older than 12 in 2015. However, eosinophils are only one of many cell types and immune system components that are involved with the body&#146;s exaggerated inflammation response in asthma. Mast cells, basophils, goblet cells and other cells also play a role. These cells can be seen infiltrating the airways along with eosinophils, leading to the conclusion that more cell types are involved. We believe that targeting just one of these components is not likely to be as effective in resolving severe asthma as an approach that targets the broader Th2 (cell-mediated) pathway. 

In 2013, Regeneron and its partner Sanofi reported proof-of-concept in a Phase IIa trial in persistent asthma with dupilumab, a currently unapproved monoclonal antibody that targets IL-4RA now in clinical development as a subcutaneously delivered agent. In a 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, Wenzel et al. reported that dupilumab showed a benefit on the asthma control questionnaire 5 (ACQ5) symptom score, a widely accepted measure for classifying the ability of a medication to control asthma. Patients dosed with dupilumab had fewer asthma attacks compared to placebo-treated patients when standard therapies, such as long-acting beta-agonists and inhaled glucocorticoids, were withdrawn, demonstrating the efficacy of dupilumab. Patients also showed improved lung function and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers. Dupilumab is administered systemically through injection. In November 2014, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that in a Phase IIb study, dupilumab also demonstrated improved lung function and reduced exacerbations when administered together with standard of care. These effects were observed in both unselected severe asthma patients and selected patients presenting elevated Th2 responses. We believe the results support the possibility of treating persistent uncontrolled asthma with a biologic therapy without narrowing the patient population based on the Th2 phenotype. Dupilumab is currently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials for severe asthma. 

Another biologic in development for severe asthma is lebrikizumab, which blocks IL-13, a mechanism known to have a similar effect to that of dupilumab. Like dupilumab and other mediators of the Th2 pathway, lebrikizumab is a validating example for subcutaneously delivered Th2 intervention in treating uncontrolled asthmatics. In a 2011 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, lebrikizumab was reported to improve lung function in severe asthma patients who were also receiving standard of care inhaled glucocorticoid therapy. At the same time, patients in the study who received lebrikizumab showed greater musculoskeletal side effects than patients receiving placebo. We believe that the ability to impact disease biology and improve lung function with biologics such as lebrikizumab is a promising result. 

We believe that there could also be significant advantages to other routes of administration, such as inhalation, of biologics that target asthma through the Th2 pathway. If delivered by inhalation, such biologics could be dosed at much lower levels and may preferentially direct the therapy to the site of the disease, in this case the lung. 

Our proposed solution: binding IL-4RA with PRS-060 

We propose to take PRS-060 forward into clinical trials first in healthy volunteers and then in severe asthma patients. These trials could accomplish two important goals: we could establish proof-of-concept for inhaled Anticalin &#174; proteins, opening up a second route of administration for our drug candidates beyond intravenous or subcutaneous injection. Following the demonstration that inhaled PRS-060 is well tolerated in healthy volunteers, we plan to enter a proof-of-concept trial in these patients, where we will evaluate whether PRS-060 can improve patient symptoms. We intend to begin a Phase I clinical trial for PRS-060 in 2017. 

Advantages to inhalation as a route of administration for PRS-060 

We have performed inhalation studies in mice and observed that systemic concentrations of PRS-060 are minimal when dosed by inhalation, as a result of low doses and short systemic residence time. This offers the 

&#160;

potential of a wider therapeutic window and possibly lower systemic side effects that may become prevalent with chronic, systemic Th2 targeting. By our calculations, the total annual dose of PRS-060 can be significantly lower than the doses being used for the monoclonal antibodies dupilumab and lebrikizumab. Furthermore, we believe that PRS-060 can be produced at a lower cost of goods than monoclonal antibodies because we intend to use manufacturing procedures that employ bacterial expression systems, which generally provides a cost advantage over mammalian production systems, typically used for mAbs. Since dosing by inhalation is a common route of administration in asthma patients, it represents a more convenient dosage regimen for patients than dosing of antibodies by injection and would not need to be administered in a physician&#146;s office or other medical setting. 

Preclinical data 

In in vitro assays, PRS-060 specifically bound to immobilized targets such as human IL-4RA in a concentration-dependent manner. We tested the binding of PRS-060 to various targets in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or the ELISA, a standard in vitro assay platform. In these tests, PRS-060 bound to IL-4RA with subnanomolar affinity and it did not bind to three other human cell-surface interleukin receptors (IL-6R, IL-18RA, IL-23RA). Furthermore, the activity of IL-4 and IL-13 was inhibited by PRS-060 in a dose-dependent manner. The below charts below show the inhibition of IL-4 (left) or IL-13 (right) induced proliferation in human TF-1 cells in vitro by PRS-060. 

&#160;

In in vivo assays in mice genetically altered to express human IL-4RA and IL-13R, low doses of PRS-060 inhibited the induction of eotaxin protein, a marker or airway inflammation, in lung tissue following pulmonary delivery. We observed this inhibition at both the RNA and protein levels compared both to buffer and to tear lipocalin. 

The below chart shows the duration of PRS-060-mediated inhibition of eotaxin gene expression, a marker of airway inflammation, in lung tissue by a single pulmonary dose in mice: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

When we administered IL-13 into the lung, inflammation was induced as determined by eotaxin expression, which was not inhibited when phosphate buffered saline, or PBS, or human Wild Type lipocalin was administered into the lung. In contrast to the PBS administration, eotaxin expression and, as a result, inflammation was prevented when PRS-060 was administered into the lung before IL-13. As demonstrated in the above chart, the model showed the inhibitory potential lasts for up to 24 hours after PRS-060 administration. 

PRS-343 targeting CD-137 in oncology 

PRS-343 is a bispecific protein targeting the immune receptor CD137 and the tumor target HER2. It is generated by genetic fusion of an Anticalin specific for CD137 with a variant of the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab. The mode of action of this CD137/HER2 bispecific is to promote CD137 clustering by bridging CD137-positive T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. PRS-343 is intended to localize CD137 activation in the tumor, and to thereby both increase efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity compared to CD137-targeting antibodies being developed by third parties in clinical trials. 

Biology of the costimulatory immune receptor CD137 

CD137, also known as 4-1BB, is a co-stimulatory immune receptor and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor, or TNFR, super-family. It is mainly expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, activated B cells, and natural killer, or NK, cells. CD137 plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses and thus is a target for cancer immunotherapy. CD137 ligand (CD137L) is the only known natural ligand of CD137, and is constitutively expressed on several types of antigen-presenting cells, or APC. CD137-positive T cells are activated by engaging a CD137L-positive cell. The induced CD137 clustering leads to activation of the receptor and downstream signaling. Note that the trimeric CD137L as a soluble molecule is not an effective CD137 agonist, providing evidence that larger scale clustering is required for activation. In a T cell pre-stimulated by the T cell receptor binding to a cognate Major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, target, costimulation via CD137 leads to further enhanced activation, survival and proliferation, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an improved capacity to kill. 

Validation of CD137 as a therapeutic target in cancer 

The benefit of CD137 costimulation for the elimination of cancerous tumors has been demonstrated in a number of in vivo models in the mouse. The forced expression of CD137L on a tumor, for example, leads to tumor rejection. Likewise, the forced expression of an anti-CD137 single chain antibody fragment (scFv) on a tumor leads to a CD4+ T-cell and NK-cell dependent elimination of the tumor. A systemically administered anti-CD137 antibody has also been demonstrated to lead to retardation of tumor growth. 

Human ex vivo data supports the extraordinary potential of CD137 as a costimulatory receptor in cancer therapy: It has been reported that for T cells isolated from human tumors, CD137 is an excellent marker for those that are tumor-reactive. In line with this observation, anti-CD137 antibodies can be utilized to improve adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) by augmenting the expansion and activity of CD8+ melanoma tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. 

Finally, the potential of CD137 targeting has also been shown in nonclinical combination therapy studies, where an additional benefit was demonstrated by combination of CD137 agonism with checkpoint blockade or NK cell-targeting antibodies. 

Current approaches to clinical CD137 targeting 

The preclinical demonstration of the potential therapeutic benefit of CD137 costimulation has spurred the development of therapeutic antibodies targeting CD137, PF-05082566 (22, 23) and BMS-663513 which are currently in early phase clinical trials.

PF-05082566 is a fully humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds CD137 in a manner that blocks the binding of endogenous CD137L to CD137, and that according to publicly available data is well tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with rituximab. 

BMS-663513 is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that, in contrast to PF-05082566, binds CD137 in a manner that does not interfere with the CD137 / CD137L interaction. While an initial trial reported manageable toxicity with doses up to 10mg/kg, a follow-up monotherapy phase II trial was reported to have been stopped due to an &#147;unusually high incidence of grade 4 hepatitis&#148;. Current clinical trials with BMS-663513 are focusing on safety and efficacy at lower doses as monotherapy or in combination e.g. with Rituximab (NCT01775631). 

Rationale for bispecific targeting of CD137 

In line with the natural mode of activation of CD137, which requires receptor clustering, an ideal CD137-targeting agent should firstly lead to clustering of CD137, and secondly do so in a tumor-localized fashion on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The antibodies currently in clinical development are not ideal in that respect, as CD137 clustering can only be induced by binding to Fc &#103; receptor-positive cells which are not selectively tumor-localized but distributed throughout the body for Fc &#103; -dependence of TNFR targeting). The toxicity data of BMS-663513 indicates that such a non-selective activation leads to unacceptable toxicity, potentially making it impossible to find a therapeutic window for such CD137-targeting antibodies. 

We therefore hypothesized that to obtain an ideal CD137-targeting agent, a bispecific molecule should be designed that targets CD137 on one end and a differentially expressed tumor target on the other end. A visualization of the general concept is provided in Figure 1, below.HER2/CD137 bispecific is envisioned to promote CD137 clustering by bridging T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells, further enhancing its T cell receptor, or TCR,-mediated activity and leading to tumor destruction. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 1 Concept of costimulatory T cell engagement. (A) The elements of the system are a target-positive tumor cell, a T cell with a TCR that is specific for an HLA/peptide combination on the tumor, and a 

&#160;

&#160; costimulatory bispecific. (B) Within a patient&#180;s tumor, tumor-specific T cells are bridged with tumor cells by a costimulatory bispecific. The resulting clustering of the costimulatory T cell receptor provides a local co-activating signal to the T cell, further enhancing its TCR-mediated activity and leading to tumor destruction. (C) Toxic side effects are expected to be manageable, as target-negative cells do not lead to costimulation of T cells due to a lack of target-mediated receptor clustering, and healthy tissue is spared by tumor-costimulated T cells due to the absence of a primary, TCR-mediated signal. Design and Generation of HER2/CD137 bispecific PRS-343 To obtain a molecule that would work by the mode of action of costimulatory T cell engagement, we generated the HER2/CD137 bispecific PRS-343. The molecule consists of two different building blocks binding to the two targets HER2 and CD137. To generate the CD137-specific building block of PRS-343, termed S0575.04J10, we utilized anticalin technology &#174; . This technology works by engineering lipocalins to bind any desired target protein with high affinity and specificity, in a manner very similar to antibodies. The lipocalin family comprises a diverse group of mostly secreted soluble proteins that bind, store and transport a broad spectrum of molecules, ranging from small molecules to proteins. Lipocalins are structurally related by possessing an 8-stranded beta-barrel structure. Lipocalin-2, also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or NGAL, is a component of granules in neutrophils and is up-regulated during inflammation. The primary function of NGAL appears to be the sequestering of bacterial siderophores (iron chelators), leading to an inhibition of bacterial growth. A CD137-binding anticalin was generated based on a re-design of the natural binding pocket of NGAL using mutant anticalin libraries and a selection and screening process. The CD137-binding anticalin S0575.04J10 binds human CD137 with an affinity of 2 nM as determined by SPR, and is capable of costimulating human T cells when immobilized on a plastic dish together with an anti-CD3 antibody. 

To generate the HER2/CD137 bispecific PRS-343, we constructed a genetic fusion of the CD137-specific anticalin S0575.04J10 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain of the trastuzumab IgG4 variant, connected by a flexible, non-immunogenic linker sequence of 15 amino acids length. 

We utilized a Sandwich ELISA experiment to investigate whether PRS-343 can bind both targets at the same time, which is a necessary prerequisite for the envisioned mode of action of PRS-343. Figure below shows that a sigmoid binding curve results from this titration, proving that both targets can indeed be engaged at the same time, fulfilling the key requirement for simultaneous costimulatory engagement of T cells by HER2-positive target cells. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 2 PRS-343 simultaneous binding to targets HER2 and CD137. Recombinant Her2 was coated on a microtiter plate, followed by titration of PRS-343. Subsequently, a constant concentration of biotinylated human CD137 was added, which was detected via a peroxidase-conjugated avidin variant, ExtrAvidin &#174; . &#160;

Mode of action &#150; costimulatory T cell activation 

We developed a novel T cell activation assay format to investigate whether PRS-343 is capable of costimulating T cells that have received a basic stimulus via the TCR. The assay, visualized in Figure 3 below, is based upon providing the T cell receptor stimulus via an anti-CD3 antibody coated onto the plastic culture dish, while CD137 costimulation is achieved by tumor-target dependent clustering of CD137 on purified T cells. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 3 Visualization of costimulatory T cell activation assay. HER2-positive tumor cells are grown overnight on cell culture plates that have been precoated with low amounts of an anti-CD3 antibody to provide a limited primary activation of T cells via the T cell receptor . T cells are added to the wells together with the titrated CD137/HER2 bispecific PRS-343, leading to clustering of the costimulatory CD137 receptor, which in turn results in T cell costimulation. T cell costimulation is detected by increased supernatant IL-2 and IFN- &#103; levels in the culture supernatants after continued culture. There is a clear induction of IL-2 (Figure A) and IFN- &#103; (Figure C) with increasing concentrations of PRS-343. The fitted EC50 of this effect is similar for both proinflammatory cytokines, with 0.7 nM for IL-2 induction and 0.3 nM for IFN- &#103; induction, respectively. That T cell costimulation is indeed due to the bispecific engagement of T cells and SKBR3 cells is shown by two observations: firstly, the monospecific antibody trastuzumab does not lead to enhanced T cell activation (average shown as dotted line in Figure A and Figure C), and secondly, disrupting the bispecific interaction with an excess of trastuzumab abolishes the effect of IL-2 and INF- &#103; induction nearly completely except at the highest concentrations of PRS-343 employed (Figure B and Figure D). 

&#160;

&#160;

Figure 4 Experimental result of costimulatory T cell activation assay. HER2-positive SKBR3 tumor cells were grown overnight on 96-well plates that had been precoated with 0.25 &#181;g/mL anti-CD3 antibody for 1 h at 37&#176;C. The next day, T cells purified from healthy donor PBMC were added to the wells together with the titrated CD137/HER2 bispecific PRS-343 (filled circle) or trastuzumab as a control (dotted line). After three days in culture, IL-2 (A) and IFN- &#103; ,levels in the culture supernatants were measured by an Electrochemoluminescence immunoassay. In parallel, the experiment was performed in the presence of an excess of trastuzumab (340 nM) to inhibit the binding of PRS-343 to the SKBR3 cells, and IL-2 (C) and IFN- &#103; (D) levels were measured. Pipeline products: 300 Series 

Current antibody-based therapies targeting tumor cell destruction or immune activation are hampered by, among other factors, low response rates and the induction of immune-related adverse events. The 300-Series Anticalin &#174; proteins are designed to target checkpoint proteins or, like PRS-343, immune-stimulatory proteins and consist of a variety of multifunctional biotherapeutics that can combine, via a genetic fusion, antibodies with Anticalin proteins or two or more Anticalin proteins to each other. These combined molecules have the potential to build upon current therapies through the capability of modifying or regulating one or more immune functions on a single fusion protein, thereby having the potential to elevate immune responses within a tumor microenvironment. We believe that a tethered Anticalin protein directed at checkpoint proteins can preferentially activate the immune system at the site of the tumor microenvironment thus providing efficacy with enhanced 

&#160;

therapeutic index. We believe that the 300-Series Anticalin proteins represent a &#147;platform within a product&#148; opportunity in immuno-oncology since it may be possible to apply a single combined Anticalin-antibody molecule in a number of different cancers. This is based on the shared underlying biology such as checkpoint and costimulatory biology found within tumors arising in different organs. 

Competition 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, scientific knowledge and strategies provide us with competitive advantages, we face and will continue to face intense competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, both in the United States and abroad. 

We compete, or will compete, with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our drug candidates target. Any drug candidates that we are able to develop and commercialize will compete with existing and new drugs being developed by our competitors. Our competitors may develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 

The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have, may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage. 

There are a number of other companies presently working to develop therapies for anemia, asthma and oncology, including divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. There are also a variety of available drug therapies marketed for these diseases. Our drug candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, and to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our drug candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. As a result, market acceptance of, and a significant share of the market for, any of our drug candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. 

In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in clinical development to treat anemia, asthma or cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies and may not be provided by any of our current or future product candidates. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates. 

Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in some of our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 

&#160;

In addition, our competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or awaiting market approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small molecule drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; identifying and validating targets; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; screening compounds against targets; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; obtaining regulatory clearances. In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; capital resources; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; research and development resources; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; manufacturing capabilities; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; sales and marketing. Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved by the FDA or its foreign counterparts or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

PRS-080 

Other drug candidates in development that interfere with hepcidin function or expression include ISIS/Xenon (anti-sense) and Alnylam (RNAi), which have nucleic acid based approaches aimed at reducing hepcidin synthesis in preclinical development. Noxxon&#146;s RNA aptamer sequesters hepcidin and is in clinical studies in cancer and ESRD patients. A mAb against hepcidin is tested in cancer as well as chronic kidney disease patients by Lilly as well as a mAb against the ferroportin transporter. Ferrumax develops a soluble form of hemojuvelin, a protein that regulates hepcidin expression and iron metabolism that aims to suppress the production rate of hepcidin. 

There are also a number of companies which are focused on treating anemia in CKD patients under alternative approaches. Fibrogen, Akebia Therapeutics, GSK, Bayer, and Japan Tobacco have hypoxia-inducible-factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitors in clinical development that target stimulation of bone marrow activity. Acceleron is also targeting the sequestration of Activin A, a natural inhibitor of hematopoiesis, is in a Phase II clinical study. Auryxia by Keryx, which targets formulation of oral iron, completed a Phase III in non-dialysis dependent CKD 3-5 patients recently (January 2016). There are also various companies conducting late-stage development of erythropoietin biosimilars. 

PRS-060 

Like PRS-060, new developments for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma patients mainly include drug candidates targeting the Th2 pathway by interfering with IL4/IL-13 or IL-5 actions. Such products 

&#160;

include dupilumab (Sanofi/Regeneron, IL-4RA), lebrikizumab (Roche/Genentech, IL-13), tralokinumab (Astra Zeneca, IL-13), mepolizumab (GSK, IL-5), reslizumab (Teva, IL-5), and benralizumab (Astra Zeneca, IL-5R). These drugs are in later clinical development (Phase II and Phase III) than PRS-060, or have been approved (mepolizumab); however, in contrast to PRS-060, these mAbs are given to patients through injection and distribute systemically through the blood stream. There are a number of other companies presently marketing or developing other therapies for asthmatic patients. The mAb omalizumab, directed against IgE, is approved and marketed for the treatment of uncontrolled, moderate to severe asthma patients. 

PRS-300 series 

Other drug candidates which target checkpoint proteins include ipilimumab, which is specific for the checkpoint protein CTLA-4 and has been marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb for the treatment of melanoma patients since 2011. Additionally, preclinical and/or clinical testing currently focusing on additional checkpoint mechanisms and targets include PD-1 / PD-L1, LAG3, IDO, TIM3, Ox-40, CD-137, CD70, KIR and NKG2A. Bristol Myers Squibb and Roche are most active in this area, with multiple single agent or combination therapy trials ongoing. Merck and AstraZeneca also have active trials ongoing, while Novartis is placing more of an emphasis on adoptive T cell transfer technology in its developmental efforts. In September 2014, Merck received FDA approval for its anti- PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced or inoperable melanoma. 

Under the 300-Series, we are also developing multispecific molecules to facilitate the more effective activation of the immune system, with a strategy of employing multispecific Anticalin &#174; protein-based molecules that may favorably bias an immune response to the tumor microenvironment. A number of other companies, such as Amgen, Affimed, Macrogenics, F-Star and Sutro, also pursue multispecific approaches in oncology, which therapies are in clinical or preclinical development. 

PRS-343 

PRS-343 is bispecific anticalin-antibody fusion protein targeting CD137 and HER2. Other drug candidates targeting the co-stimulatory receptor CD137 include urelumab, which is being developed by Bristol Myers Squibb, and PF-05082566, which is being developed by Pfizer, both of which are currently in clinical development (Biomedtracker, January 21, 2016). In the HER2-positive space, several actors are active with approved, clinical and preclinical drugs candidates. The most prominent actor is Roche, having three approved drugs on the market through its subsidiary Genentech. The first drug from Roche targeting HER2 is Trastuzumab, which has been marketed for treatment of breast cancer patients since 1998 and for gastric cancer patients since 2010. The two other drugs are pertuzumab and Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine which both are marketed for breast cancer patients. 

No known competitor is developing a CD137 and HER2 bispecific drug candidate but a number of companies such as Amgen, Affimed, Macrogenics, F-Star, Sutro Biopharma and Immunocore are pursuing multispecific approaches in immuno-oncology, which therapies are either approved, in clinical development or preclinical development. 

Additionally, other actors such as AstraZeneca, Novartis, Agenus, Five Prime Therapeutics and Celldex have preclinical and clinical development programs focusing on other co-stimulatory targets which include OX40, CD40, GITR and CD27. 

Manufacturing 

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our drug candidates for larger scale preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial quantities of any drug candidates that are approved. 

&#160;

We currently rely on one CMO for all of our clinical supplies, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, drug substances and finished drug products for our preclinical research and clinical trials, including the Phase Ia trial for PRS-080. 

We believe that we will be able to contract with another CMO to obtain API if our existing source of API was no longer available or sufficient, but there is no assurance that API would be available from another third-party manufacturer on acceptable terms, on the timeframe that our business would require, or at all. We do not have long-term supply commitments or other arrangements in place with our existing CMO. We also do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of bulk drug substance. 

We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our drug candidates if they are approved, and we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of our product candidates as they near potential approval. 

Any drug products to be used in clinical trials and any approved product that we may commercialize will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the FDA&#146;s current good manufacturing practice requirements and comparable requirements of the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors. 

We believe that PRS-080, PRS-060 and PRS 343 and our other Anticalin &#174; -branded drug candidates can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible biologic processes from readily available starting materials. PRS-080 and PRS-060 are produced using bacterial expression systems similar to those that have been used in the past for the production of other proteins and which systems are widely used in the industry. PRS-343 is produced using a mammalian expression system similar to those systems which are widely used in the industry for the production of antibodies. We believe that the manufacturing process is amenable to scale-up and will not require unusual or expensive equipment. We expect to continue to develop, on our own or with our collaborators, drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 

Intellectual Property and Exclusivity 

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity of our proprietary Anticalin &#174; -brand technologies through intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, libraries of different protein scaffolds and consensus sequences and the fundamental Anticalin platform technology, including novel therapeutic and diagnostic discoveries, as well as other proprietary know-how, and to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. 

We seek to protect our exclusive position of Anticalin &#174; technologies by, among other means, prosecuting our own international, U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We established intellectual property protection in relation to our Anticalin technologies in key global markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and the United States. We believe we have patent exclusivity relating to drug candidates derived from lipocalin proteins that runs until at least 2020 in the United States. We also rely on trade secrets for confidential know-how, which we generally seek to protect through contractual (e.g. confidentiality) obligations with employees and third parties. 

We have protected the goodwill of our Company and our drug candidates, created through innovation and development, by putting in place trademark registrations of Pieris &#174; and Anticalin &#174; as well as several defensive registrations. 

We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file patent applications and maintain granted patents directed to our key drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions relating to new compositions of 

&#160;

matter for these drug candidates, as well as novel medical applications of these compounds in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of various indications. We also intend to seek patent protection, if available, with respect to biomarkers that may contribute to selecting the right patient population for use of any of our drug candidates, or with respect to pharmaceutical formulations that may be useful to produce final medicinal products. 

Following the effective date of our Research and Licensing Agreement with Technische Universit&#228;t M&#252;nchen, or TUM (See &#147;&#151;TUM License Agreement&#148;), and as of March 23, 2016, we owned or were the exclusive licensee of a patent portfolio consisting of several issued U.S. patents, and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, several pending applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, multiple pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions as well as three pending provisional patent applications, as described in further detail below. 

In applicable jurisdictions, we will seek patent term extensions for certain of our patents including the patent term adjustment period in the United States. If we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in the United States or in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, we may be eligible for regulatory protection, such as twelve years of data exclusivity for new biological entities in the United States and as mentioned below, up to five years of patent term extension potentially available in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act, 8 to 11 years of data and marketing exclusivity potentially available for new drugs in the European Union, up to five years of patent extension in Europe (Supplemental Protection Certificate), and eight years of data exclusivity potentially available in Japan. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any such regulatory exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. See &#147;&#151;Government Regulation.&#148; 

Among the issued patents we own are U.S. patent No. 7,250,297; U.S. patent No. 7,723,476; U.S. patent No. 8,158,753; U.S. patent No. 8,536,307; and their respective counterparts in the European Union, which patents are directed to the basic Anticalin &#174; protein concept and platform technology (i.e. antagonist or agonist compounds derived from a natural lipocalin protein) and are expected to expire in 2018, subject to patent term adjustments in the U.S. of up to 794 days. In addition, we hold issued U.S. patents Nos.: 7,001,882; 7,118,915; 7,691,970; 7,585,940; 7,893,208; and 8,313,924; and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, which patents are related to libraries of different scaffolds and consensus sequences such as human apolipoprotein D, human neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or hNGAL, and human tear lipocalin, and are expected to expire between 2020 and 2027, subject to patent term adjustments in the U.S. of up to 685 days. We also own U.S. patent No. 7,892,827, which is directed to muteins derived from hNGAL having binding specificity for the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen, or CTLA-4, and is expected to expire in 2025, subject to a 350-day patent term adjustments in the U.S., and U.S. patent No. 8,313,924, which is directed to muteins of human tear lipocalin having detectable binding affinity to interleukin 4 receptor alpha chain, or IL-4 receptor alpha, and is expected to expire in 2027, subject to a 424 day patent term adjustment in the United States, as well as their counterparts in the European Union and in a number of foreign jurisdictions. 

As a result of research efforts to date under the Research and License Agreement with TUM, we hold a worldwide exclusive license to multiple patents and patent applications. In the United States, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,598,317 for the composition of matter of mutein of human tear lipocalin binding to the extracellular region of the T-cell co-receptor CD4 with detectable affinity, which patent will expire in 2027 (subject to a patent term adjustment period which is expected to be at least 742 days), as well as to its counterpart in the European Union. We also hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,420,051 directed to library of hNGAL scaffold of certain consensus sequence, which patent is expected to expire in 2029 (subject to a patent term adjustment period of 109 days), as well as to its counterparts in the European Union and in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,987,415 claiming isolated crystalline form of monomeric bacterial lipocalin. 

As of March 23, 2016, a significant portion of our pending U.S. patent applications and pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions was directed to newly-discovered or improved scaffold libraries of lipocalin 

&#160;

muteins, compounds derived therefrom, or the uses of such compounds to treat, prevent and mitigate certain diseases and conditions whose pathological development involve the targets of interest as well as to diagnose, prognose and select treatments for the diseases and conditions. We would expect that any patents that may issue from the pending U.S. patent applications would likely expire between 2029 and 2035 without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or other extensions, however, any and all of these patent applications may not result in issued patents, and not all issued patents may be maintained in force for their entire term. Specifically, granted patents and pending patent applications directed to Anticalin &#174; proteins for the cMet target currently have terms which could expire as late as 2029, and granted patents and pending patent applications directed to Anticalin proteins for each of hepcidin and IL-4RA currently have terms which could expire as late as 2031. We are actively pursuing intellectual property protection for our 300-Series in key global markets that, if granted, could expire as late as 2035. To date, we are not aware of any third party intellectual property for freedom to operate on our platforms or therapeutic programs. 

In addition to patents, we hold three trademarks in the United States, for Anticalin &#174; , Pieris &#174; , and Pocket Binding &#174; . Similarly, we hold their respective counterparts, either as registered trademarks or as pending applications, in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We expect that we will continue to look for trademark protection for the goodwill associated with our Company and our drug candidates in the countries or regions where we will have investment, research and development, sales or other activities. 

We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. We strive to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements and/or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third-party. We also actively manage our publication and patent applications in that we only disclose information necessary to stir scientific interest or demonstrate patentability without materially compromising the secrecy of our valuable trade secrets and know-how. While we consider trade secrets and know-how to be a critical component of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, with respect to our technology platform, we anticipate that these trade secrets and know-how will over the course of time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology and the movement of personnel skilled in the technology from academic to industry positions and vice versa. As a result, those proprietary trade secrets and know-how may lose their value to us over a period of time, and we may lose any competitive advantage afforded by them as they become public knowledge. 

Strategic Partnerships 

Since 2007, we have entered into several licensing, research and development collaborations to complement our drug discovery and early stage development capabilities. Specifically, we have entered into licensing, research and development agreements which are still active as of the date hereof with Allergan, Inc., or Allergan, Sanofi Group (formerly Sanofi-Aventis and Sanofi-Pasteur SA) and collectively, Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo and Roche. Under these licensing and research and development arrangements, we have developed and conducted or will develop and conduct selection and screening of drug candidates as well as in vitro potency and efficacy testing using our Anticalin &#174; -brand drug discovery platform, our Anticalin-brand libraries and other proprietary methods to generate, identify and characterize drug candidates against certain biological targets associated with several diseases. These agreements have provided us with approximately &#128;33.4 million ($36.3 million) in revenue to date, excluding grant revenues. With respect to discontinued collaborations, we have no ongoing performance obligations, and do not expect to receive any significant additional consideration pursuant to those agreements. 

Pieris&#146;s agreements with Allergan, Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo and Roche are ongoing and, under which, our partners are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize drug candidates identified in the course of the collaboration. We are entitled to receive from our partners&#146; research, development and 

&#160;

regulatory milestone payments and, in the case of the Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo and Roche collaborations, royalties on net sales for products developed and commercialized under these collaborations. Under our collaboration with Roche we have received an upfront-payment in January 2016. We plan to continue to actively seek out additional collaboration partners. 

In addition to Pieris&#146;s agreements with Allergan, Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo and Roche, we are partnering with companies with expertise in clinical development, regulatory affairs and biologics manufacturing to advance our pipeline products through clinical trials and to market those products. In 2013, Pieris entered into a co-development alliance with Cadila Healthcare Limited, or Zydus, with respect to the development and sale of certain proprietary products, under which Zydus will focus on developing markets and we will focus on developed markets. Pieris has also entered into a joint development and license agreement with Stelis, establishing a collaboration for clinical development and commercialization of certain of our proprietary products, focusing initially on use in ophthalmological applications. 

Certain terms and conditions of our active agreements with Allergan, Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo and Roche are summarized below as well as certain terms and conditions of our co-development agreements with Zydus and Stelis. 

Our agreement with Allergan 

In August 2009, we entered into an agreement with Allergan, Inc. (NYSE: AGN) for the use of our proprietary Anticalin &#174; technologies in the discovery and development of drug candidates which inhibit a selected target. Under the terms of the agreement, we provided drug candidates for the treatment of ocular diseases, and Allergan is responsible for the further development and commercialization of products based on those candidates and bearing related costs. We have granted Allergan a worldwide and exclusive license under our patent portfolio for the use of certain drug candidates for the treatment and prevention of ocular diseases. 

Upon entering into the agreement, we received a payment of $10 million. We are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $13 million in additional payments on achieving various milestones. We are not entitled to any royalties from sales of products commercialized under our agreement with Allergan. During the term of the agreement and as long as Allergan commercializes the drug candidates designated under the agreement, we may not grant rights to any third party with respect to any drug candidates that inhibit the same target within the field licensed to Allergan. 

The agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the payment obligations of Allergan to us thereunder. Either we or Allergan may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#146;s material breach of the agreement remains uncured for a specified period or in the event the bankruptcy of the other party. Allergan has the unilateral right to terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to us. On termination, all rights granted to Allergan in our Anticalin &#174; technologies would end. 

Our collaboration with Sanofi 

In September 2010, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi, which was subsequently amended in February 2013. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to use our proprietary Anticalin &#174; technologies to identify drug candidates against certain targets, with further development and commercialization activities conducted by Sanofi. The collaboration started with two targets under two separate collaboration projects and was extended by an additional multispecific Anticalin program in 2013. When we entered the collaboration we granted Sanofi an exclusive worldwide license to develop drug candidates identified in the course of the collaboration and market products based on those drug candidates under the collaboration. 

In consideration of our obligations, as a part of the collaboration we received a &#128;3.5 million ($3.8 million) upfront payment and specified research funding. We also are entitled to receive payments on the achievement of 

&#160;

research, development and commercial milestones for each product, with up to &#128;26.0 million ($28.4 million) in development milestones and up to &#128;18 million ($19.6 million) in commercial milestones for the first therapeutic application and lesser amounts on subsequent therapeutic applications. We have the ability to receive over &#128;50 million ($54.5 million) potential milestone payments from the active collaboration project, including estimated milestone payments in connection with one or more subsequent applications. Payments due to us also include tiered mid-to mid-high single digit royalties on sales of products. We have agreed that we will not use our Anticalin &#174; technologies to perform, on our own behalf or for third parties, any research or development activities on the same target to which any active program relates. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all payment and related obligations of Sanofi thereunder. 

During the term of the agreement, Sanofi may terminate any or all programs thereunder for convenience by giving specified prior written notice to us. Either party may also terminate the agreement for a material breach by the other party which remains uncured after specified advance notice of such breach or for the other party&#146;s insolvency. If a program or the agreement is terminated by Sanofi, rights in products and developed technology resulting from the terminated program (including the right to grant sublicenses) revert or are transferred to us. If a program is terminated prior to the development of the product by Sanofi, our right to commercialize that product is royalty-free. Otherwise, we would owe to Sanofi royalties in the single digits as a percentage of net sales on such product sold by us or our licensee, with total royalty payments capped at a certain amount, and with the royalty rate dependent on the maturity of the program at the time of termination. Sanofi has terminated two of the three programs (one program was terminated for internal strategic reasons and the other program was terminated following in vivo studies, as in vitro functionality did not fully translate into in vivo functionality for this first in class program), and we have the right to develop and commercialize drug candidates of the terminated programs on a royalty-free basis. The remaining active collaboration project was handed over to Sanofi for further development in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, in January 2015, Pieris transferred to Sanofi ownership of the intellectual property of the remaining active collaboration project, including the obligation for payment of expenses of obtaining patents or other registrations of such intellectual property. All other rights and obligations of the parties under the Sanofi collaboration remain unchanged. 

Our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo 

In May 2011, we entered into a definitive collaboration research and technology licensing agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, under which we agreed to use our proprietary Anticalin &#174; scaffold technologies to discover novel drug candidates against two targets chosen by Daiichi Sankyo under two separate collaboration projects. Upon achievement of preclinical development milestones for lead drug candidates, Daiichi Sankyo assumes responsibility for, and to use commercially reasonable efforts in, the further development and marketing of products based on those candidates. We handed over further development responsibility for the two collaboration projects to Daiichi Sankyo in March 2013 and June 2014, respectively. 

We received &#128;7.2 million ($7.9 million) upon signing of the collaboration agreement and received research funding. We are entitled to payment on the achievement of research and development milestones of up to &#128;35.9 million ($39.2 million) for the first prophylactic or therapeutic product, with reduced amounts for achievement of those milestones in additional indications. We are also entitled to payment of commercialization milestones of up to &#128;45 million ($49.1 million) for a prophylactic or therapeutic product. On development and commercialization of a diagnostic product, we are entitled to development and commercialization milestones of up to approximately &#128;0.7 million ($0.8 million). We have the ability to receive up to approximately &#128;200 million ($218 million) in potential milestone payments from the two collaboration projects, including estimated milestone payments in connection with one or more additional indications. Daiichi Sankyo is further obliged to pay to us tiered, mid- to mid-high single digit royalties on sales of products for prophylactic and therapeutic uses and low single digits on sales of products for diagnostic uses. We granted Daiichi Sankyo exclusive license rights worldwide for prophylactic and therapeutic products, and nonexclusive rights for diagnostic uses. During the collaboration, we may not use our Anticalin &#174; technologies in research or commercial activities on the designated targets for our own account or with third parties. 

&#160;

Daiichi Sankyo may terminate any program under the collaboration after a certain research stage for convenience by giving specified prior written notice to us. Either party may also terminate the agreement for a material breach by the other party which remains uncured after specified advance notice of such breach or for the other party&#146;s insolvency. If a program is terminated, rights in products and developed technology resulting from the terminated program (including the right to grant sublicenses) revert or are transferred to us. If a program is terminated by us because of a material breach by Daiichi Sankyo, our sale of products resulting from the program is royalty-free. If a program is terminated by us because of Daiichi Sankyo&#146;s failure to meet diligence obligations or by Daiichi Sankyo for convenience, we will be required to pay to Daiichi Sankyo royalties on sale of products resulting from the program in the low single digits as a percentage of net sales up to a specified aggregate royalty amount. 

Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until (i) the expiration of all payment and related obligations of Daiichi Sankyo thereunder or (ii) upon the decision of Daiichi Sankyo not to develop any drug candidate under the collaboration agreement. 

Our collaboration with Zydus 

In October 2013, we entered into a development and license agreement with Zydus. Under the terms of the agreement, we collaborate with Zydus in the development of certain Anticalin &#174; drug candidates, including PRS-110, and Zydus takes the lead in advancing those products through preclinical and clinical proof of concept development and is responsible for its expenses relating to that advancement, which include drug manufacturing. Zydus has been granted exclusive rights to commercialize these products in India and several other developing countries. We retain the right to commercialize these products in key developed markets. We and Zydus have cross-licensed our respective rights in new inventions derived during the collaboration for these products in these territories. 

Under the terms of the collaboration, we would be entitled to a payment on achievement of a certain development milestone in the Zydus territory, and a low-to mid-single digit royalty on product sales. We would also be entitled to a share of Zydus&#146; revenue from a sublicense of its rights in the product. We are obliged on the occurrence of a product&#146;s achieving certain development milestones in our territory to make payments to Zydus, and to pay low-single digit royalties on product sales. We also are obliged to share with Zydus a percentage of our revenue received from out-licensing rights in the product in our territory, which percentage varies based on the stage of development of the product at the time of out-licensing, should we choose to out-license the product. Upon completion of a certain stage of clinical development, either party may choose to discontinue development, in which case the other party would have the right to continue development and its payment obligations to the discontinuing party would be reduced. During the term of the agreement, with respect to PRS-110, we may not sell a product, or enable a third party to sell a product, that is the subject of the collaboration in the Zydus territory for use in the treatment, palliation or prevention of certain diseases in humans. Under the terms of the agreement, we could be required to pay up to an aggregate of $18.0 million in milestone payments to Zydus, and could be entitled to a $1.0 million milestone payment from Zydus. 

The agreement will remain in effect until both parties cease to have their respective payment obligations thereunder. Either party may also terminate the agreement for a material breach by the other party which remains uncured after specified advance notice of such breach, the other party&#146;s insolvency, or where the parties conclude that clinical data do not support further development. 

Our collaboration with Stelis 

In November 2013, Pieris entered into a joint development and license agreement with Stelis. Under the terms of the agreement, we collaborate with Stelis in the development of certain Anticalin &#174; drug candidates, initially for use in the treatment, palliation or prevention of ophthalmology-related diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we contribute certain proprietary assets to the development project, and Stelis agrees to establish a production process for preclinical and clinical supplies of product at its expense and to perform and fund certain 

&#160;

preclinical studies and a first-in-human clinical study for each product under joint development at the expense of Stelis. We agreed that upon reaching certain development stages for a product, we and Stelis would discuss the possible formation of a joint venture with approximately equal shareholding between Pieris and Stelis to further develop and commercialize such product worldwide. If a party does not wish to enter into a joint venture, the other party may continue development and commercialization of a product, subject to terms and conditions to be established by a separate agreement. 

Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect on a product by product basis until the later of (i) the parties entry into the joint venture as discussed above, (ii) upon receipt of written notice of a decision not to enter into the joint venture from the other party, the receiving party timely elects to continue development and commercialization of a product, and (iii) the parties agree in good faith on how to dispose of a project in the event that neither party wishes to enter into the joint venture, provided, however, that the term of any product shall automatically end no later than one year after completion of the first phase I trial for such product unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Prior to the formation of the joint venture, either party may also terminate the agreement for a material breach by the other party which remains uncured after specified advance notice of such breach, or for the other party&#146;s insolvency. 

Our collaboration with Roche 

On December 8, 2015 Pieris entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann- La Roche Inc., collectively Roche, in cancer immune therapy for the research, development and commercialization of Anticalin-based drug candidates against a predefined, undisclosed target. 

Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of CHF 6.5 million ($6.5 million) in January 2016 and Roche committed to provide research funding, and we may receive development and regulatory-based milestone payments, sales-based milestone payments as well as mid-single-digit to low double-digit royalties on any future product sales. If all milestones and other conditions are met, the total payments to us could surpass CHF 415 million ($415.7 million), excluding royalties. 

The parties will jointly pursue a preclinical research program with respect to the identification and generation of Anticalins that bind to a specific target for an expected period of 20 months, which may be extended under certain circumstances. During the research term of the agreement, Roche will fund the work to be performed by us pursuant to the research plan. Following the research program, Roche will be responsible for subsequent pre-clinical and clinical development of any product and will have worldwide commercialization rights. 

Unless earlier terminated, the term of the agreement continues until no royalty or other payment obligations are or will become due under the agreement. The agreement may be terminated (i) by either party based on insolvency or breach by the other party and such insolvency proceeding is not dismissed or such breach is not cured within 90 days; or (ii) after 15 months from the effective date of the agreement, by Roche as a whole or on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis upon 90 days prior written notice before the first commercial sale of a product or upon 180 days prior written notice after the first commercial sale of a product. Roche may also, in its sole discretion, terminate the agreement upon a change of control of Pieris involving a company that develops or commercializes biopharmaceutical products. 

TUM License Agreement 

On July 4, 2003, we entered into a Research and Licensing agreement with TUM, which was subsequently renewed and amended, on July 26, 2007. The agreement establishes a joint research effort led by Prof. Arne Skerra, Chair of Biological Chemistry of TUM, to optimize Anticalin &#174; technologies for use in therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic applications and as research reagents, and to gain fundamental insights in lipocalin scaffolds. We provided certain funding for TUM research efforts performed under the agreement. The research phase of this collaboration ended on February 28, 2013. 

&#160;

Under the terms of the agreement TUM assigns to us certain materials and records resulting from the research. We retain rights to inventions made by our employees, and TUM assigns to us all inventions made under the agreement jointly by our employees and TUM personnel, provided that our employees have made a certain inventive contribution. With respect to all other inventions made in the course of the research, TUM grants to us worldwide exclusive license rights under patents and patent applications claiming such inventions. TUM retains rights to practice these inventions for research and teaching purposes. 

As a result of research efforts to date under the agreement, we hold a worldwide exclusive license under our license agreement with TUM to multiple patents and patent applications. In the United States, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,598,317 for the composition of matter of mutein of human tear lipocalin binding to the extracellular region of the T-cell co-receptor CD4 with detectable affinity, which patent will expire in 2027 (subject to a patent term adjustment period which is expected to be at least 742 days), as well as to its counterpart in the European Union. We also hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,420,051 directed to library of hNGAL scaffold of certain consensus sequence, which patent is expected to expire in 2029 (subject to a patent term adjustment period of 109 days), as well as to its counterparts in the European Union and in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,987,415 claiming isolated crystalline form of monomeric bacterial lipocalin. We bear the costs of filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents assigned or licensed to us under the agreement. 

As consideration for the assignments and licenses, we are obliged to pay to TUM milestone payments on development of our proprietary products claimed by patents assigned or licensed to us by TUM. For each of such proprietary products developed by us, we could be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately &#128;0.2 million ($0.2 million) in milestone payments to TUM under the agreement. 

We also are obliged to pay low single digit royalties, including annual minimum royalties, on sales of such products. Should we grant licenses or sublicenses to those patents to third parties, we are obliged to share a percentage of resulting revenue with TUM, which percentage of resulting revenue is creditable against our annual license payments to TUM. Our payment obligations are reduced by our proportionate contribution to a joint invention. Payment obligations terminate on expiration or annulment of the last patent covered by the agreement. 

We can terminate the licenses to any or all licensed patents upon specified advance notice to TUM. TUM may terminate the license provisions of the agreement only for cause. Termination of the agreement does not terminate our rights in patents assigned to us. 

Upon initiation of the Phase Ia clinical trial of PRS-080 in November 2014, our obligation to pay TUM a milestone payment of &#128;10,000 ($12,101) pursuant to the terms of the TUM License Agreement was triggered. We have certain reporting obligations to TUM under the TUM License Agreement and will report this trigger to TUM pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Upon issuance of such a report, we will be obligated to pay to TUM such milestone payment. We were also involved in a dispute with TUM, for which arbitration has concluded in 2015, which is described in more detail under &#147;Item 3. Legal Proceedings&#151;Arbitration Proceeding with Technische Universit&#228;t M&#252;nchen.&#148; 

Government Regulation 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S. The animal and other non-clinical data 

&#160;

and the results of human clinical trials performed under an Investigational New Drug application, or IND , and under similar foreign applications will become part of the NDA. 

U.S. Drug Development Process 

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. 

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice regulations. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually. In addition, timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase II: This phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase III: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. 

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the 

&#160;

applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA, or an approved letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#146;s continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. 

NDAs or BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity and original BLAs will be 6 months from the date that the NDA or BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug&#146;s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. 

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted in 2012, made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent 

&#160;

beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. The FDASIA made permanent the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, which provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. If the Written Request does not include studies in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those studies. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies. 

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of &#147;generic&#148; biologics&#151;biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve-year exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. 

The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency. 

An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances. 

In February 2012, the FDA issued 3 draft guidance documents on biosimilar product development. The draft guidance documents are: &#147;Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product,&#148; &#147;Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Protein Product,&#148; and &#147;Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.&#148; In April 2013, the FDA issued a fourth draft guidance entitled, &#147; Formal Meetings between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants . &#148; The guidance documents provide the FDA&#146;s current thinking on approaches to demonstrating that a proposed biological product is biosimilar to a reference product. The FDA received public comments on the draft documents and intends to issue final guidance documents in the future. Nevertheless, the absence of a final guidance document does not prevent a sponsor for seeking licensure of a biosimilar under the BPCIA. 

&#160;

Orphan Drug Designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#146;s product for the same indication or disease. 

The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical trials to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions. A product does not have to be designated as an orphan drug to be eligible for the grant program. An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition. The study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market. 

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 

The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#146;s request. 

Under the fast track program and the FDA&#146;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 

In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post- approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 

In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug&#146;s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a 

&#160;

schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

Under FDASIA, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law&#146;s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In June 2013, the FDA published a draft Guidance for Industry entitled, &#147;Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics&#148; which provides guidance on FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy designation. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to an IND. The FDA has already granted this designation to over 30 new drugs and has approved several. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. 

Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

Foreign Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 28-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

&#160;

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more &#147;concerned&#148; member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the &#147;reference&#148; member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#146;s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the submission and approval of a clinical trial authorization application be obtained in each Member State be obtained before commencing a clinical trial in that Member State. 

As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor&#146;s generic product. For example, in the EU, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the European Economic Area, or EEA which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, we expect they will benefit from 8 years of data exclusivity and an additional 2 years of marketing exclusivity. An additional one-year extension of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period, we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that is deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product&#146;s first marketing authorization in the EU and prevents biosimilars from relying on the holder of the marketing authorization for the reference biological medicine&#146;s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of 8 years. After 8 years, a biosimilar product application may be submitted and the sponsoring companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder&#146;s data. However, a biosimilar medicine cannot launch until 2 years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or 3 years later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the 8 year data exclusivity period. 

As in the United States, a sponsor may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. 

Reimbursement 

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and 

&#160;

other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to by significantly lower. 

Employees 

As of March 23, 2016, we had 38 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. Of these 39 employees, 27 are engaged in research and development activities and 12 work in general support and administration. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. To successfully develop our drug candidates, we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We anticipate hiring additional employees for research and development, clinical and regulatory affairs and general and administrative activities over the next few years. We also utilize the services of consultants, clinical research organizations and other third parties on a regular basis.
