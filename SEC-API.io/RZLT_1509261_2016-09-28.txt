 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160;

AntriaBio, Inc. (&#8220; AntriaBio &#8221;, the &#8220; Company &#8221;. &#8220; we &#8221; or &#8220; us &#8221;) is a biopharmaceutical company that develops novel, sustained release injectable therapies. We apply our proprietary formulation and manufacturing capabilities to known, well-characterized molecules to create differentiated, patent-protected therapies that have the potential to significantly improve existing standards of care.

&#160;

Lead Product Candidate: AB101 

&#160;

Our lead product candidate (&#8220; AB101 &#8221;), a microsphere formulation of PEGylated human recombinant insulin, is being developed as an extended acting basal insulin intended for once-weekly subcutaneous injection, for use alone and in combination with bolus prandial insulin or oral glucose lowering therapies, to improve glycemic control in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. We believe that AB101 has the potential to provide a near peak-less, slow and uniform release of basal insulin. The current standard of care in the $11 billion basal insulin market is daily or twice a day injections.

&#160; 

AB101 Formulation 

&#160;

To formulate AB101 we use PEGylation chemistry to attach a low molecular weight (5000 Daltons) polyethylene glycol (&#8220; PEG &#8221;) to the phenylalanine amino acid residue on the N-terminus of insulin&#8217;s B peptide chain to create PEGylated insulin (&#8220; peginsulin &#8221;). By attaching a PEG in this fashion, human insulin becomes amphiphilic and can be uniformly co-dissolved in a solvent with a biodegradable polymer (&#8220; PLGA &#8221;). Following the dissolution of peginsulin and PLGA, the solvent is removed through an emulsification process and when dried, uniform microspheres are formed in a solid state solution. Prior to administration, the microspheres are reconstituted in an aqueous solution and when injected, the microspheres dissolve through hydrolysis, releasing insulin at a slow, steady and predictable rate over the course of a week.

&#160;

AB101 Preclinical Studies and Clinical Plans 

&#160;

In 2015, as a precursor to our US clinical studies and in order to fulfill requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (&#8220; FDA &#8221;) in support of an Investigational New Drug (&#8220; IND &#8221;) filing, we conducted pre-clinical studies, including acute and sub-acute toxicity studies in two species, safety pharmacology, and mutagenicity/genotoxicity studies.

&#160;

The intended clinical development plan for AB101 is consistent with the FDA&#8217;s Guidance for Industry, Diabetes Mellitus: Developing Drugs and Therapeutic Biologics for Treatment and Prevention , and will be generally modeled after recent development programs for long-acting basal insulin products. Variations will be introduced to account for the specific characteristics of AB101, as applicable. The overall goal of the program will be to demonstrate efficacy and safety of once-weekly AB101 compared to currently available basal insulins.

&#160;

The single ascending dose study in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus will be followed by repeat dose pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics studies. Euglycemic clamping will be utilized to evaluate the time-action profile for glucose lowering following repeated once-weekly doses of AB101, and to determine steady-state.

&#160;

In addition, the Company plans to conduct a Phase 2 program to assess and confirm the intended dosing profile, specifically of the once weekly dosing frequency, and for dose-ranging. The Phase 3 registration program will comprise multiple studies to compare efficacy and safety to currently available basal insulins, in various combinations with bolus insulin and/or oral glucose lowering agents. It will be of adequate size to meet recommended guidance for assessing chronic safety when used for Diabetes Mellitus.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Next Product Candidate: AB301 

&#160;

In September 2015, we announced the addition of AB301 to our product development pipeline. As a potential treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, AB301 is a once-weekly injectable combination of a PEGylated human glucagon-like peptide-1 (&#8220; GLP-1 &#8221;) agonist and AB101, our basal insulin lead product candidate. We believe that there is a potential advantage of combining a GLP-1 agonist with basal insulin to complement glycemic control while attenuating weight gain and hypoglycemic risk. As a once-weekly injectable therapy, AB301 would be differentiated from potential competing combination therapies that require daily injections. In vitro and in vivo studies completed to date indicate that AB301 has the potential to be a well-tolerated, effective therapy for type 2 diabetes and we are engaged in ongoing preclinical studies of AB301. Prior to initiating any IND-enabling studies for AB301, we are monitoring the FDA&#8217;s actions with respect to its evaluation around potential competing combination therapies.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants and in the development and acquisition of technologies.

&#160;

If successfully commercialized, AB101 would compete directly against Sanofi&#8217;s Lantus and Toujeo, Novo Nordisk&#8217;s Levemir and Tresiba, Eli Lilly&#8217;s Basaglar as well as any other branded or biosimilar basal insulin therapies that obtain regulatory approval in advance of AB101.

&#160;

Sanofi&#8217;s iGlarLixi and Novo Nordisk&#8217;s IDegLiraare daily injectable GLP-1 agonist and basal insulin combination therapies that are currently under regulatory review by the FDA. IDegLira was approved for commercial use in the European Union under the trade name Xultophy in September 2014. Adocia recently announced plans to develop BioChaperone Glargine Dulaglutide and BioChaperone Liraglutide, which are GLP-1 agonist and basal insulin combination therapies consisting of insulin glargine (Lantus&#174;) and either Eli Lilly&#8217;s Trulicty (dulaglutide) or Novo Nordisk&#8217;s Victoza (liraglutide). If we successfully develop and commercialize AB301, it would compete directly against iGlarLixi, IDegLira, BioChaperone Glargine Dulaglutide, BioChaperone Liraglutide and any other GLP-1 agonist and basal insulin combination therapies that obtain regulatory approval. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk are large pharmaceutical companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and development resources than AntriaBio. Further, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are very competitive and are characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation.

&#160; 

We believe there are a number of additional therapies in preclinical and clinical development to treat diabetes that may result in effective, commercially successful treatments, including drugs that may be in development by Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and other organizations. Each of these therapies and others may compete with AB101 and AB301.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

As an innovator in the development of extended release drug therapies, we are executing a patent strategy to protect technologies and inventions that are essential to our business. As part of this strategy, we will continue to build on our existing patent portfolio by filing patent applications for additional product candidates, and novel technologies, through ongoing research and development. Our patent strategy also involves relying upon trade secrets and know-how &#8211; particularly in formulation and manufacturing &#8211; in order to develop and maintain our competitive position.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

One of our patents involves a single-step method for rapidly and efficiently preparing conjugates of insulin and its analogs with hydrophilic polymers, such as PEG. This method includes reacting a protein and a hydrophilic polymer in the presence of at least one organic solvent and at least one metal chelator, under near-neutral conditions. More specifically, this invention is directed to the site-specific modification of the proteins with PEG. It also provides a pharmaceutical formulation for the uniform mixture of the protein-PEG conjugate in a biodegradable polymer. This patent, which expires in April 2024, is issued in the US, Australia, India, Japan and Europe, and is pending in Canada, Brazil, China and Hong Kong.

&#160;

As it relates to this invention, our lead product candidate, AB101, is comprised of a PEG molecule linked to human recombinant insulin specifically at the phenylalanine amino acid at position B1. We formulate a biodegradable microsphere that is a homogenous solid solution of PLGA and the insulin-PEG conjugate is formulated. We plan to apply this method of preparing protein-polymer conjugates, and formulating them with biodegradable polymers to future product candidates as well.

&#160;

As part of our strategy to enhance our patent portfolio, in July 2014, we filed a nonprovisional patent application covering novel methods and systems used to create biodegradable microparticles with superior syringeability, injectability, flowability, and uniformity. This patent is issued in the US and is pending in other jurisdictions, which expires in 2034. The methods claimed in the patent are directed towards the microsphere manufacturing technology platform that is broadly applicable to current and future products under development.

&#160;

Additionally, we filed a provisional patent application in December 2014 around novel compositions and systems used to create formulations for sustained release products that are used by themselves or in combination with other molecules. Further, we filed a provisional patent application in June 2015 around improved methods for site-specific amine pegylation.

&#160;

We plan on filing additional patent applications over time that are directed towards both technology enhancements and product candidates.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Regulation by governmental authorities in the US and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. All of our potential products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, pharmaceutical therapies are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in foreign countries. Various federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping and marketing of such products.

&#160;

We are also subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions; laboratory and manufacturing practices; the experimental use of animals; and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research, development and manufacturing.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We incurred approximately $9,448,000 and $4,701,000 in research and development expenses for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, we had thirty full-time employees as well as four contract employees, all of whom have experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. None of our employees or contractors are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
