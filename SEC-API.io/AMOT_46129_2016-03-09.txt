Acquisitions 

&#160; 

Subsequent to the end of 2015, on January 12, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Heidrive GmbH, a drive technology and engineering company for &#128;20,000 (approximately US $22,000). Headquartered in Kelheim, Germany, Heidrive designs and manufactures customized, innovative synchronous motion systems for highly demanding applications from medical technology and robotics to cargo aviation and building technologies, as well as various commercial applications. Its products 

&#160; 

&#160; 

include a variety of motors, gears and electronic controls. Heidrive has approximately 220 employees with manufacturing facilities in Kelheim and Mrakov, Czech Republic. Heidrive&#146;s 2015 revenues were approximately &#128;29,000 (US $32,000), up about 8% from the prior year, and total assets at December 31, 2015 were approximately &#128;10,000 (US $11,000). The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Allied Motion. 

&#160; 

Segment Information 

&#160; 

We operate in one segment for the design and manufacture of motion control products, marketed to original equipment manufacturers and end users. Segment information, including sales from external customers, assets by segment, and long-lived assets by geographic area, as set forth in Note 12, Segment Information, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements is contained in Item 8 of this report.

&#160; 

Competitive Environment 

&#160; 

Our products and solutions are sold into a global market with a large and diverse group of competitors that vary by product, geography, industry and application. We believe the motion control market is highly fragmented with many competitors, a number of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than Allied Motion. We believe our competitive advantages include our electro-magnetic, mechanical and electronic motion control expertise, the breadth of our motor technologies and of our ability to integrate these technologies with our encoders, gearing, power electronics, digital control technologies and network/feedback communications capabilities, as well as our global presence. Unlike many of our competitors, we are unique in our ability to provide custom-engineered motion control solutions that integrate the products we manufacture such as embedded or external electrical control solutions with our motors. We compete on technological capabilities, quality, reliability, service responsiveness, delivery speed and price. Our competitors include Ametek, Danaher Motion, Parker Hannifin Corporation, and other smaller competitors. 

&#160; 

Availability of Parts and Raw Materials 

&#160; 

All parts and raw materials used by the Company are in adequate supply. No significant parts or raw materials are acquired from a single source or for which an alternate source is not also available. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions 

&#160; 

We hold a number of patents and trademarks for components manufactured by our various subsidiaries, and we have several patents pending on new products recently developed, which are considered to be of major significance. 

&#160; 

Working Capital Items 

&#160; 

We currently maintain inventory levels adequate for our short-term needs based upon present levels of production. We consider the component parts of our different product lines to be readily available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs. 

&#160; 

Major Customers 

&#160; 

During 2013, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. During 2014 and 2015, the Company&#146;s total annual revenues increased significantly as a result of both sales to customers of businesses acquired by the Company during that period and from increased sales to a number of existing customers of the Company, with five customers accounting for approximately 40% of the Company&#146;s total revenue during each of those years. 

&#160; 

Sales Backlog 

&#160; 

Backlog as of December 31, 2015 was $70,999 compared with $75,065 as of December 31, 2014. The time to convert the majority of backlog to sales is approximately three to four months. Given the short product lead times, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog of orders is a reliable indication of our future sales. We may on occasion receive multi-year orders from customers for product to be delivered on demand over that time frame. There can be no assurance that the Company&#146;s backlog from these customers will be converted into revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Engineering and Development Activities 

&#160; 

Our engineering and development (E&#38;D) activities are for the development of new products, enhancement of the functionality, effectiveness and reliability of current products, to redesign products to reduce the cost of manufacturing of products or to expand the types of applications for which our products and solutions can be used. Our expenditures on engineering and development for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $14,229 and $13,881, respectively, or approximately 6% of sales in both years. We believe E&#38;D is critical to our success and expect to continue to invest at least at these levels in the future. Of these expenditures, no material amounts were charged directly to customers, although we do record non-recurring engineering (NRE) charges to certain customers for custom engineering required to develop products that meet the customer&#146;s specifications. 

&#160; 

Environmental Issues 

&#160; 

No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company&#146;s operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by Federal, State or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. 

&#160; 

We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. 

&#160; 

International Operations 

&#160; 

Our operations outside the United States are conducted through wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries and are located primarily in Europe and Asia. Our international operations are subject to the usual risks inherent in international trade, including currency fluctuations, local government contracting regulations, local governmental restrictions on foreign investment and repatriation of profits, exchange controls, regulation of the import and distribution of foreign goods, as well as changing economic and social conditions in countries in which our operations are conducted. The information required by this item is set forth in Note 12, Segment Information, of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 1,046 full-time employees worldwide. Of those, approximately 600 are located in North America, 335 are located in Europe and the balance are located in China and the rest of the world. 

&#160;
