 Item 1. Business 

Biovail Corporation (&#8220;Biovail&#8221;) was formed under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on February 18, 2000, as a result of the amalgamation of TXM Corporation and Biovail Corporation International. Biovail was continued under the Canada Business Corporations Act &#32;(the &#8220;CBCA&#8221;) effective June 29, 2005. In connection with the acquisition of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (&#8220;Valeant&#8221;) in September 2010, Biovail was renamed &#8220;Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.&#8221; 

Effective August 9, 2013, we continued from the federal jurisdiction of Canada to the Province of British Columbia, meaning that we became a company registered under the laws of the Province of British Columbia as if we had been incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. As a result of this continuance, our legal domicile became the Province of British Columbia, the Canada Business Corporations Act ceased to apply to us and we became subject to the British Columbia Business Corporations Act. 

On April 25, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors has named Joseph C. Papa to become our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Papa is expected to join the Company by early May. 

Unless the context indicates otherwise, when we refer to &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#8220;Form 10-K&#8221;), we are referring to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 

Introduction 

We are a multinational, specialty pharmaceutical and medical device company that develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of branded, generic and branded generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) products, and medical devices (contact lenses, intraocular lenses, ophthalmic surgical equipment, and aesthetics devices), which are marketed directly or indirectly in over 100 countries. In the Developed Markets segment, we focus most of our efforts in the areas of dermatology, neurology, gastrointestinal (&#8220;GI&#8221;) disorders, and eye health therapeutic classes. In the Emerging Markets segment, we focus primarily on branded generics, OTC products, and medical devices. We are diverse not only in our sources of revenue from our broad drug and medical device portfolio, but also among the therapeutic classes and geographies we serve. 

Business Strategy 

Our strategy is to focus our business on core geographies and therapeutic classes that offer attractive growth opportunities while maintaining our lower selling, general and administrative cost model and decentralized operating structure. Within our chosen therapeutic classes and geographies, we primarily focus on durable products which have the potential for strong operating margins and sustainable organic growth. We believe these products are particularly attractive for a number of reasons including: 

&#8226; 

They are largely cash pay, or are reimbursed through private insurance, and, as a result, are less dependent on increasing government reimbursement pressures than other products; 

&#8226; 

They tend to have established brand names and do not rely primarily on patent or regulatory exclusivity; 

&#8226; 

They tend to have the potential for line extensions and life-cycle management programs; and 

&#8226; 

They tend to be smaller on an individual basis, and therefore typically not the focus of larger pharmaceutical companies. 

Another critical element of our strategy is our lower risk, output-focused research and development model. This model allows us to advance certain development programs to drive future commercial growth, while minimizing our research and development expense. This is achieved primarily by: 

&#8226; 

focusing on innovation through our internal research and development, acquisitions, and in-licensing; 

&#8226; 

focusing on productivity through measures such as leveraging industry overcapacity and outsourcing commodity services; 

&#8226; 

focusing on critical skills and capabilities needed to bring new technologies to the market; 

&#8226; 

pursuing life-cycle management programs for currently marketed products to increase such products&#8217; value during their commercial lives; and 

&#8226; 

acquiring dossiers and registrations for branded generic products in emerging markets, which require limited manufacturing start-up and development activities. 

Some of our key development programs are described in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Products in Development&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Our long-term strategy has also included deploying cash via business development, debt repayment and repurchases, and share buybacks. Since the Company&#8217;s (then named Biovail Corporation) acquisition of Valeant on September 28, 2010, we have completed numerous transactions to expand our portfolio offering and geographic footprint, including, among others, the acquisitions of Salix Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (&#8220;Salix&#8221;) and Bausch &#38; Lomb Holdings Incorporated (&#8220;B&#38;L&#8221;). While we anticipate that business development through acquisitions may continue to be a component of our long-term strategy, we expect the volume and size of acquisitions to be minimal in 2016 and possibly beyond, as we focus on reducing our outstanding debt levels. Additionally, as a result of the April 11, 2016 amendment to our Credit Agreement (as defined herein), until we file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 (&#8220;First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q&#8221;) and achieve a specified leverage ratio, we are subject to various restrictions that will impact how we conduct our business, including restrictions on making acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions, over an aggregate Transaction Cap (as defined herein) and from incurring any further debt to finance such acquisitions and a requirement that the proceeds from certain asset sales be used to repay the term loans under our Credit Agreement, instead of being reinvested in the business. In addition, our ability to, among other things, repurchase our common shares will also be restricted and subject to the Transaction Cap described above, until such time that we file our First Quarter 2016 Form 10-Q and achieve a specified leverage ratio. Refer to Note 26 titled "SUBSEQUENT EVENTS" of notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional details on and exceptions to these restrictions. 

We believe our strategy will allow us to maximize both the growth rate and profitability of the Company and to enhance shareholder value.

Research and Development 

Our research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) organization focuses on the development of products through clinical trials. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 &#32;were $334 million , $246 million &#32;and $157 million , respectively, excluding impairment charges. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 1,200 &#32;employees (including regulatory affairs and quality assurance employees) were involved in our R&#38;D efforts. 

For more information regarding our products in clinical development, see Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Products in Development&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Trademarks, Patents and Proprietary Rights 

We rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality policies and procedures and patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrecy laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property and proprietary rights, as appropriate. See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risk associated with our intellectual property and proprietary rights. 

Trademarks 

We believe that trademark protection is an important part of establishing product and brand recognition. We own or license a number of registered trademarks and trademark applications in the U.S., Canada and in various other countries throughout the world. U.S. federal registrations for trademarks remain in force for 10 years and may be renewed every 10 years after issuance, provided the mark is still being used in commerce. Trademark registrations in Canada remain in force for 15 years and may be renewed every 15 years after issuance, provided that, as in the case of U.S. federal trademark registrations, the mark is still being used in commerce. Other countries generally have similar but varying terms and renewal policies with respect to trademarks registered in those countries. 

Data and Patent Exclusivity 

For certain of our products, we rely on a combination of regulatory and patent rights to protect the value of our investment in the development of these products. 

A patent is the grant of a property right which allows its holder to exclude others from, among other things, selling the subject invention in, or importing such invention into, the jurisdiction that granted the patent. In the U.S., Canada and the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;), generally patents expire 20 years from the date of application. We have obtained, acquired or in-licensed a number of patents and patent applications covering key aspects of certain of our principal products. In the aggregate, our patents are of material importance to our business taken as a whole. However, we do not consider any single patent material to our business as a whole. 

In the U.S., the Hatch-Waxman Act provides non-patent regulatory exclusivity for five years from the date of the first FDA approval of a new drug compound in a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;). The FDA, with one exception, is prohibited during those five years from accepting for filing a generic, or ANDA, that references the NDA. In reference to the foregoing exception, if a patent is indexed in the FDA Orange Book for the new drug compound, a generic may file an ANDA four years from the NDA approval date if it also files a Paragraph IV Certification with the FDA challenging the patent. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the filing or approval of another full NDA. However, the NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to independently demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

A similar data exclusivity scheme exists in the EU, whereby only the pioneer drug company can use data obtained at the pioneer&#8217;s expense for up to eight years from the date of the first approval of a drug by the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) and no generic drug can be marketed for ten years from the approval of the innovator product. Under both the U.S. and the EU data exclusivity programs, products without patent protection can be marketed by others so long as they repeat the clinical trials necessary to show safety and efficacy. Canada employs a similar data exclusivity regulatory regime for innovative drugs. 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or a disease whose incidence rates number more 

than 200,000 where the sponsor establishes that it does not realistically anticipate that its product sales will be sufficient to recover its costs. The sponsor that obtains the first marketing approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease is eligible to receive marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the orphan indication for a period of seven years. 

Proprietary Know-How 

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know-how, trade secrets and technological innovation in the development and manufacture of many of our principal products. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information. 

Government Regulations 

Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, in Canada, in the EU and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, advertising and promotion, storage, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. As such, our products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation both before and after approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions or criminal prosecution. 

Prior to human use, FDA approval (drugs (in the form of an NDA or ANDA for generic equivalents), biologics (in the form of a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;)) and some medical devices) or marketing clearance (other devices) must be obtained in the U.S., approval by Health Canada must be obtained in Canada, EMA approval (drugs) or a CE Marking (devices) must be obtained for countries that are part of the EU and approval must be obtained from comparable agencies in other countries prior to manufacturing or marketing new pharmaceutical products or medical devices. Generally, preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must first be conducted and the results submitted to the applicable regulatory agency (such as the FDA) for approval. 

&#32;Regulation by other federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;), and state and local authorities in the U.S., and by comparable agencies in certain foreign countries, is also required. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;), the FDA and state and local authorities regulate the advertising of medical devices, prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, sale, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products. The FDA requires a Boxed Warning (sometimes referred to as a &#8220;Black Box&#8221; Warning) for products that have shown a significant risk of severe or life-threatening adverse events and similar warnings are also required to be displayed on the product in certain other jurisdictions. 

Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products and medical devices are required to comply with manufacturing regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and quality system management requirements, enforced by the FDA and Health Canada, in the U.S. and Canada respectively, and similar regulations enforced by regulatory agencies in other countries and we may face ongoing audits of our facilities and plants and those of our contract manufacturers by the FDA and such other regulatory agencies. In addition, we are subject to price control restrictions on our pharmaceutical products in many countries in which we operate. 

We are also subject to extensive U.S. federal and state health care marketing and fraud and abuse regulations, such as the federal False Claims Act, federal and provincial marketing regulation in Canada and similar regulations in foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. The federal False Claims Act imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities who submit (or cause the submission of) false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal or state healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Some state anti-kickback laws also prohibit such conduct where commercial insurance, rather than federal or state, programs are involved. Due to recent legislative changes, violations of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. In addition, in the U.S., companies may not promote drugs or medical devices for &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses - that is, uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those that were approved or cleared by the FDA - and &#8220;off-label promotion&#8221; has also formed the predicate for False Claims Act liability resulting in significant financial settlements. These and other laws and regulations, rules and policies may significantly impact the manner in which we are permitted to market our products. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or 

governmental regulation, or if interpretations of the foregoing change, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 

We may also be subject to various privacy and security regulations, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (collectively, "HIPAA"). HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common health care transactions (e.g., health care claims information and plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan enrollment, coordination of benefits and related information), as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. These standards require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. Complying with these laws involves costs to our business, and failure to comply with these laws can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties. 

Successful commercialization of our products may depend, in part, on the availability of governmental and third party payor reimbursement for the cost of our products. Third party payors may include government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. In the U.S., the E.U. and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and third party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. In the U.S., these pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. In particular, sales of our products may be subject to discounts from list price and rebate obligations, as well as formulary coverage decisions impacting or limiting the types of patients for whom coverage will be provided. Various U.S. healthcare and other laws regulate our interactions with government agencies, private insurance companies and other third party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for our products. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. In countries outside the U.S., the success of our products may depend, at least in part, on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because in many countries, patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, negotiating prices with certain governmental authorities for newly developed products can delay commercialization. In many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes, tenders and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase. 

See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with these regulations and related matters. 

Environmental and Other Regulation 

Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in both the U.S. and countries outside the U.S., including those governing the discharges of substances into the air, water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes, wastewater and solid waste, the cleanup of properties affected by known pollutants and other environmental matters. Certain of our development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We cannot assure, however, that environmental liabilities relating to facilities owned or operated by us will not develop in the future, and we cannot predict whether any such liabilities, if they were to develop, would require significant expenditures on our part. In addition, we are unable to predict what legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future with respect to environmental protection, hazardous materials management and waste disposal. See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information.

We currently promote our pharmaceutical products to physicians, hospitals, pharmacies and wholesalers through our own sales force and sell through wholesalers. In some limited markets, we additionally sell directly to physicians, hospitals and large drug store chains and we sell through distributors in countries where we do not have our own sales staff. Certain products were dispensed through the Philidor pharmacy network. In October 2015, we announced that we would be severing all ties with Philidor, and effective November 1, 2015, we signed an agreement terminating all arrangements with or relating to Philidor, other than certain transition services which ended in January 2016 (see Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding Philidor, as well as our new fulfillment agreements with Walgreens). As part of our marketing program for pharmaceuticals, we use direct to customer advertising, direct mailings, advertise in trade and medical periodicals, exhibit products at medical conventions and sponsor medical education symposia. 

Competition 

Competitive Landscape for Products and Products in Development 

The pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly competitive. Our competitors include specialty and other large pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, biotechnology companies, OTC companies and generic manufacturers, in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America and in other countries in which we market our products. The dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of mid-size and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC and cosmeceutical sectors. With respect to the GI market, generic entrants continue to capture significant share for treatment of many GI conditions. In the area of irritable bowel syndrome ("IBS") and opioid induced constipation ("OIC"), competitors have recently launched new competing products, which should increase the size of these markets and intensify competition. The market for eye health products is very competitive, both across product categories and geographies. In addition to larger diversified pharmaceutical and medical device companies, we face competition in the eye health market from mid-size and smaller, regional and entrepreneurial companies with fewer products in niche areas or regions. 

Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology and podiatry, GI disorders, eye health and other therapeutic areas. Academic and other research and development institutions may also develop products or technologies that compete with our products, which technologies and products may be acquired or licensed by our competitors. These competitors may have greater financial, R&#38;D or marketing resources than we do. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. 

We sell a broad range of products, and competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which the products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts. 

Generic Competition 

We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products when patents covering certain of our currently marketed products expire or are successfully challenged or when the regulatory exclusivity for our products expires or is otherwise lost. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. 

A number of our products already face generic competition, including, among others, Glumetza&#174;, Vanos&#174; (in the U.S.), Wellbutrin XL&#174; (in the U.S. and Canada), Zovirax&#174; ointment, certain strengths of Retin-A Micro&#174;, Carac&#174;, Xenazine&#174;, Targetin&#174; capsules, Atralin&#174;, and Tasmar&#174;. In addition, certain of our products face the expiration of their patent or regulatory 

exclusivity in 2016 or in later years, following which we anticipate generic competition of these products. In addition, in certain cases, as a result of negotiated settlements of some of our patent infringement proceedings against generic competitors, we have granted licenses to such generic companies, which will permit them to enter the market with their generic products prior to the expiration of our applicable patent or regulatory exclusivity. Finally, for certain of our products that lost patent or regulatory exclusivity in prior years, we anticipate that generic competitors may launch in 2016 or in later years. Our products facing a potential loss of exclusivity and/or generic competition in 2016 and in later years include, among others, the following: in 2016, Ziana&#174;, Zirgan&#174;, Visudyne&#174;, Zegerid&#174;, Virazole&#174;, and Nitropress&#174;; in 2017, Lotemax&#174; Gel, Macugen&#174;, Deflux&#174;, Solesta&#174;, and Isuprel&#174;; in 2018, Acanya&#174;, Solodyn&#174;, Istalol&#174;, Elidel&#174;, and Moviprep&#174;; in 2019, Zyclara&#174;; and in 2020, Luzu&#174; and Tiazac&#174; (in Canada). 

In addition, for a number of our products (including Xifaxan&#174;, Relistor&#174;, Onexton&#174;, Prolensa&#174;, Uceris&#174;, Moviprep&#174;, Acanya&#174;, Bepreve&#174; and Apriso&#174;), we have commenced infringement proceedings against potential generic competitors in the U.S. and Canada. If we are not successful in these proceedings, we may face increased generic competition for these products. See Note 21 titled "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" of notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding certain of these infringement proceedings. 

See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information on our competition risks. 

Manufacturing 

We currently operate approximately 50 manufacturing plants worldwide. All of our manufacturing facilities that require certification from the FDA, Health Canada or foreign agencies have obtained such approval. 

We also subcontract the manufacturing of certain of our products, including products manufactured under the rights acquired from other pharmaceutical companies. Generally, where the selling company is manufacturing the acquired products, acquired products continue to be produced for a specific period of time by the selling company. During that time, we integrate the products into our own manufacturing facilities or initiate manufacturing agreements with third parties. Where the acquired products are manufactured by contract manufacturers, we generally assume those arrangements from the selling company. 

Products representing approximately half of our product sales for 2015 are produced by third party manufacturers under manufacturing arrangements. 

In some cases, the principal raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredient, used by us (or our third party manufacturers) for our various products are purchased in the open market or are otherwise available from several sources. However, some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and other raw materials used in our products and some of the finished products themselves are currently only available from a single source; or others may in the future become available from only one source. In addition, in some cases, only a single source of such active pharmaceutical ingredient is identified in filings with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, and cannot be changed without prior regulatory approval. Any disruption in the supply of any such single-sourced active pharmaceutical ingredient, other raw material or finished product or an increase in the cost of such materials or products could adversely impact our ability to manufacture or sell such products, the ability of our third party manufacturers to supply us with such products, or our profitability. We attempt to manage the risks associated with reliance on single sources of active pharmaceutical ingredient, other raw materials or finished products by carrying additional inventories or, where possible, developing second sources of supply. See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information on the risks associated with our manufacturing arrangements. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 22,000 employees. These employees included approximately 10,100 in production, 8,600 in sales and marketing, 2,100 in general and administrative positions and 1,200 in R&#38;D (including regulatory affairs and quality assurance). Collective bargaining exists for some employees in a number of countries in which we do business. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations. 

Product Liability Insurance 

Since March 31, 2014, we have self-insured substantially all of our product liability risk for claims arising after that date. In the future, we will continue to re-evaluate our decision to self-insure and may purchase additional product liability insurance to cover product liability risk. See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K for additional information. 

Seasonality of Business 

Historically, revenues from our business tend to be weighted toward the second half of the year. Sales in the first quarter tend to be lower as patient co-pays and deductibles reset at the beginning of each year. Further, the third quarter &#8220;back to school&#8221; period favorably impacts demand for certain of our dermatology products. Sales in the fourth quarter tend to be higher based on consumer and customer purchasing patterns associated with healthcare reimbursement programs. However, there are no assurances that these historical trends will continue in the future. 

We expect the weighting of revenues toward the second half of the year to be more pronounced in 2016, given the transition of certain of our products under the fulfillment arrangements with Walgreens described in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Geographic Areas 

A significant portion of our revenues is generated from operations or otherwise earned outside the U.S. and Canada. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, political and economic instability and restrictive governmental actions including possible nationalization or expropriation. Changes in the relative values of currencies may materially affect our results of operations. For a discussion of these risks, see Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

See Note 23 titled &#8220;SEGMENT INFORMATION&#8221; of notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for detailed information regarding revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area. 

In 2015, a material portion of our revenue and income was earned in Ireland, Luxembourg and Switzerland, which have low tax rates. See Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K relating to tax rates.
