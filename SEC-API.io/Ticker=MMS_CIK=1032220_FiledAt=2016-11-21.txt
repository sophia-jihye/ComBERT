 ITEM 1. Business. 

Throughout this annual report, the terms "MAXIMUS," "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to MAXIMUS, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

General 

We are a leading operator of government health and human services programs worldwide. We act as a partner to governments under our mission of Helping Government Serve the People. &#174; &#32; 

Over the past five years, our revenue and earnings have grown primarily as a result of demographic, economic and legislative trends. These trends drive demand for services from providers, such as MAXIMUS, that offer efficient and cost-effective solutions to these trends, including: 

&#8226; 

A need for governments to manage budgets in the face of increasing demands for social services; 

&#8226; 

Aging populations that place a greater strain on health care and welfare systems; 

&#8226; 

A global demand for social services that are based upon measurable outcomes; and 

&#8226; 

Legislative initiatives, such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or welfare reform efforts, which require the implementation of new services and new programs. 

We believe that governments within the United States and around the world face similar challenges and that these challenges will continue to grow over the next decade. 

With our proven track record and expertise, we are in a strong position to provide these services. We believe that we bring the right combination of people, business processes and technology to deliver the best-value solution to governments. Our success has allowed us to gain market share in the areas in which we operate. As a result, we are: 

&#8226; 

The largest provider of Medicaid enrollment and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) services in the U.S.; 

&#8226; 

A leading operator of U.S. health insurance exchange customer contact centers, with services provided to four entities operating state-based exchanges and a customer contact center for the federal marketplace; 

&#8226; 

The largest provider of government-sponsored health benefit appeals and assessments in the U.S. and the United Kingdom; 

&#8226; 

One of the largest providers of disability and long-term sick support services in the U.K.; 

&#8226; 

One of the largest providers of occupational health services in the U.K.; and 

&#8226; 

An established provider of welfare-to-work services throughout all of our geographies, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. 

Much of our revenue is derived from long-term contractual arrangements with governments. Most often, a contract will have a base period and additional option periods thereafter. As a result, the total length of a contract, if all options are exercised, may often range between five and ten years. This provides good visibility in terms of predicting revenue. Most of our contracts are related to long-term, stable programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, the ACA and long-term employment support programs. Our client relationships are frequently decades long. 

We also pursue selective acquisitions to enhance and expand our offerings or geographic presence. 

&#8226; 

In 2016, we acquired Ascend Management Innovations, LLC (Ascend), a provider of independent, specialized health assessments and data management tools to government agencies in the U.S. 

&#8226; 

In 2016, we acquired Assessments Australia, a provider of assessments to identify what support services may be required in order to make individuals successful in a community environment. 

&#8226; 

In 2015, we acquired Acentia, LLC (Acentia), a provider of system modernization, software development, program management and other information technology services to the U.S. Federal Government. 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

In 2012, we acquired Policy Studies, Inc., a provider of health and human services operations in the U.S. 

Our business segments 

The Company is organized and managed based on the services we provide: Health Services, U.S. Federal Services and Human Services. 

For more information on our segment presentation, including comparative revenue, gross profit, operating income, identifiable assets and related financial information for the 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;fiscal years, see "Note 2. Business segments" within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we incorporate by reference herein. 

Health Services Segment 

Our Health Services Segment generated 54% &#32;of our total revenue in fiscal year 2016 . 

The Health Services Segment provides a variety of business process services, appeals and assessments as well as related consulting services, for state, provincial and national government programs. These services support Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and the ACA in the U.S., Health Insurance BC (British Columbia) in Canada and HAAS and Fit for Work Service in the U.K. The Segment's services help people access, navigate and use health benefits and other government programs. The Segment also helps governments engage with program recipients, while at the same time helping governments to improve the efficiency, cost effectiveness, quality and accountability of their health and disability benefits programs. 

Approximately 76% of our revenue for this segment comes from our comprehensive administrative and program operations services for government health benefits programs. These services include: 

&#8226; 

Health insurance exchange customer contact center operations and support services; 

&#8226; 

Health insurance program eligibility and enrollment services to help beneficiaries make the best choice for their health insurance coverage and improve their access to health care; 

&#8226; 

Beneficiary outreach and education&#8212;including multilingual customer contact centers and multi-channel self-service options, such as Web-based portals&#8212;for easy enrollment; 

&#8226; 

Application assistance and independent health plan enrollment counseling to beneficiaries; 

&#8226; 

Premium payment processing and administration, such as invoicing and reconciliation; 

&#8226; 

Health plan oversight; and 

&#8226; 

Comprehensive eHealth solutions with the Medigent &#174; &#32;product suite. 

Approximately 23% of the Segment&#8217;s revenue is from our independent health review services. These services include: 

&#8226; 

Independent disability, long-term sick and other health assessments, including those related to long-term services and supports; and 

&#8226; 

Occupational health clinical assessments. 

We also provide specialized consulting services, including Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) planning. These services comprise less than one percent of the Segment&#8217;s revenue. 

All of our contracts are different, but we are typically reimbursed for our services based upon the volumes of work performed, the number of participants served, the levels of achievement reached against specified goals, or a combination of these factors. The Health Services Segment may experience seasonality due to transaction-based work, such as program open enrollment periods and activity related to contract life cycles. Most notably, the 

Segment may experience revenue and margin fluctuations associated with the ACA, which provides an open enrollment period that begins in our first fiscal quarter and extends into our second fiscal quarter. The exact dates may be subject to change by the U.S. Federal Government. During the first quarter of our fiscal year, reductions in working days due to holidays and vacations may also impact our sales and accounts receivable, but the effect is generally not significant. 

U.S. Federal Services Segment 

Our U.S. Federal Services Segment generated 25% &#32;of our total revenue in fiscal year 2016 . 

The U.S. Federal Services Segment provides business process services and program management for large government programs, independent health review and appeals services for both the U.S. Federal Government and similar state-based programs and technology solutions for civilian federal programs. The acquisition of Acentia in 2015 provided us with access to twelve new contract vehicles with the U.S. Federal Government. We currently serve nineteen federal agencies. 

Approximately 36% of the Segment&#8217;s revenue is from our comprehensive government program administration services. These include: 

&#8226; 

Centralized customer contact centers and support services; 

&#8226; 

Document and record management; and 

&#8226; 

Case management, citizen engagement and consumer education. 

Approximately 28% of the Segment&#8217;s revenue is from our independent health review services. These include: 

&#8226; 

Independent medical reviews and worker's compensation benefit appeals; 

&#8226; 

Health benefit appeals; and 

&#8226; 

Eligibility appeals. 

Approximately 36% of the Segment&#8217;s revenue is from our technology solutions. These include: 

&#8226; 

Modernization of systems and information technology (IT) infrastructure; 

&#8226; 

Infrastructure operations and support; 

&#8226; 

Software development, operations and management; and 

&#8226; 

Data analytics. 

Many programs within the Segment are reimbursed on a cost-plus or a time-and-materials basis, although revenue may also be based upon participant numbers. Our independent health review services business is typically based upon the number and type of appeals processed. The U.S. Federal Services Segment is not expected to experience seasonality related to its programs. However, it may experience fluctuations as a result of program maturity including lower revenue and profitability related to transaction or performance based-contracts during program start-up. Some of the contracts may also be structured as cost-reimbursable, which typically carry the lowest level of risk but also carry lower levels of operating margin. 

Human Services Segment 

Our Human Services Segment generated 21% &#32;of our total revenue in fiscal year 2016 . 

The Human Services Segment provides national, state and local human services agencies with a variety of business process services and related consulting services for government programs. 

&#8226; 

Approximately 74% of the Segment&#8217;s revenue is from comprehensive welfare&#8209;to&#8209;work services that help disadvantaged individuals transition from government assistance programs to sustainable employment and economic independence Services include eligibility determination, case management, job&#8209;readiness preparation, job search and employer outreach, job retention and career advancement, and selected educational and training services. Programs served include the Work Programme and Work Choice in the U.K.; jobactive, Disability Employment Services and Young Refugee Assistance in Australia; Temporary 

Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) in the U.S.; the Employment Program of British Columbia, Canada; and the Ta&#8217;Qat and Tawafuq programs in Saudi Arabia. These services are typically reimbursed through fees for case management with incentives for providing sustained employment for participants. In recent years, the emphasis on payments has moved toward the incentive fees. 

&#8226; 

A further 15% of the Segment&#8217;s revenue is generated from full and specialized child support case management services, customer contact center operations, and program and systems consulting services. Revenue is typically based upon outcomes. 

The balance of the Segment&#8217;s revenue comes from specialized services including: 

&#8226; 

Management tools and professional consulting services for higher education institutions; 

&#8226; 

Program consulting services, including independent verification and validation, cost allocation plans and other specialized consulting offerings; and 

&#8226; 

Tax credit and employer services. 

The Human Services Segment's business is not expected to experience seasonality. 

Geographic Information 

We operate in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. The distribution of revenue and assets across geographies are included in "Note 2. Business Segments" within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market overview 

We expect that demand for our core offerings will continue to increase over the next few years. This is driven principally by macro trends such as new legislation, new or updated regulations, an increasing interest by governments to implement outcomes-based programs, austerity measures and increasing caseloads, as governments strive to deliver more services with fewer resources. In addition, we believe there is an increasing propensity by certain governments to use public-private partnerships and seek help from firms like MAXIMUS as a means to run more effective and efficient programs. We believe that we remain well-positioned to benefit from this increasing demand. 

Demand for our services is contingent upon factors that affect governments, including: 

&#8226; 

The need for governments to deliver efficient, cost-effective services to program beneficiaries while meeting legal requirements and achieving programmatic goals and value for funds spent on social benefit programs; 

&#8226; 

The requirement of U.S. state governments to implement federal initiatives and qualify for federal matching funds; 

&#8226; 

The impact of continued budgetary pressures, which result in governments having to operate more programs with the same level of resources and/or implement cost-control measures; 

&#8226; 

The increased demand for social benefit programs as a result of rising caseloads and demographic trends in many developed countries; and 

&#8226; 

The need to improve business processes, push innovations, and update technology for public programs as governments seek outside sources of support to gain needed expertise or to address trends as more public workers become eligible for retirement. 

As a result, governments hire companies like MAXIMUS to help them deliver innovative, efficient and cost-effective services to beneficiaries on their behalf. We possess the knowledge and resources to operate government health and human programs efficiently and to engage with program beneficiaries, while maintaining the service levels and achieving the outcomes demanded by our clients. With the ability to balance resources with demand, we also offer the flexibility and scalability that governments do not always possess. 

Health Services Market Environment 

According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, health care spending in the U.S. still far exceeds that of other high-income countries. The Kaiser Family Foundation noted an acceleration of U.S. health care spending in 2014 due, in part, to increased coverage under the ACA and predicts that spending growth will continue at a higher rates than in recent years, but not to the double-digit growth seen in previous decades. 

Effectively managing these costs, as well as improving quality and access to health care, is a major policy priority for governments. Governments seek efficient and cost-effective solutions to manage their public health benefit programs. This includes programs meant to support individuals with disabilities and long-term medical conditions, as well as individuals with shorter-term health conditions. 

Outside the U.S., many governments are seeking partners to help them manage, administer or operate their social benefit programs. Countries like the U.K. are examining how public health relates to productivity, cost reduction and economic growth. The U.K. Government provides a range of social welfare benefits for people who are unable to work as a result of a disability, long-term illness or other health condition. For individuals with long-term sickness or disabilities, the government requires an independent health assessment provided by a vendor through HAAS. The assessment is used by the government to determine an individual's level of benefits. We believe there is continued market demand to conduct independent assessments for participants in public benefit programs and to support employers and their employees through our commercial occupational health services. 

In the U.S., as a result of Medicaid expansion and the ACA, many states have made program changes. These changes have occurred most notably through benefit changes and the expansion of managed care to new populations that have historically been served through fee-for-service Medicaid or are now eligible for coverage through the ACA health insurance exchanges. 

The ACA expanded access to health coverage primarily through insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion. States are not required to expand their Medicaid programs, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates that most will expand coverage over the next several years. The Kaiser Family Foundation reported that 31 states and the District of Columbia have already expanded Medicaid as of October 2016. In addition, states have seen an increase in Medicaid participation as a result of the "woodwork effect" as the level of visibility for these programs has increased, more individuals who are eligible for Medicaid have applied for coverage. 

The ACA also extends CHIP through 2019 and provides increased matching federal funds. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015 provides new federal funding for CHIP through 2017. We currently serve as the administrative CHIP vendor in six states. 

In 2016, certain states and the District of Columbia operated their own exchanges. Other states participate in a partnership model or have opted to use the federal exchange. We currently operate customer contact centers for the District of Columbia and three state-based exchanges. We also operate one customer contact center as a subcontractor for the federal marketplace. In 2017, states will have access to the State Innovation Waivers, also known as the 1332 Waivers, which give states the most comprehensive and flexible framework for best using federal funding for their public health insurance programs. As a result, we believe that these waivers may create a more palatable path for additional states to contemplate new ways to operate their health benefit programs over the coming years. 

The election of Donald Trump has renewed focus on the future of the ACA. President-elect Trump's campaign platform included a goal to repeal and replace the ACA. The factors that drove the passage of the ACA, including the large number of Americans without health insurance, are still present and the Trump administration has articulated his interest to broaden health care, make it affordable, and improve its quality. We believe we are well-positioned to assist the new administration and the individual states in any repeal, replacement or modification of the ACA. 

Many governments are also looking for innovative solutions to support disabled and elderly populations who require long-term services and supports (LTSS). A general trend in the LTSS market has been to ensure that individuals are in the right setting and receiving the right level of support and care. In many cases, this means allowing individuals to receive care at home or in a community-based settings, rather than institutional facilities. Conflict-free assessment services assist governments in determining the most appropriate placement and health care services for program beneficiaries. 

&#32;We believe the current health market environment positions us to benefit from continued demand across all of our geographies from service areas such as operations program management and health assessments. Overall, we expect the underlying demand for our services to increase over the next several years. 

U.S. Federal Services Market Environment 

The U.S. federal market continues to see modest growth after several years of uncertainty due primarily to political struggles around the federal budget and the subsequent reduction of agency budgets. The President's 

fiscal 2017 budget proposal includes a 1.3 percent increase in overall federal IT spending and a 1.1 percent increase in civilian agency IT spending. 

Through our acquisition of Acentia, we are now a full-service provider of business process services and technology solutions to the U.S. Federal Government. The acquisition also provided 12 new contract vehicles that give us the opportunity to bid on task orders that we were previously unable to bid as a prime contractor. We also have access to new federal agencies, as well as the ability to expand our current portfolio of work with agencies where both companies have existing relationships. Our expanded capabilities allow us to address more comprehensively many of the challenges faced by federal agencies today. We have seen a substantial increase in long-term sales opportunities as a result of the acquisition. The business has been fully integrated and now operates under the MAXIMUS Federal Services brand. 

While federal agency budgets still face fiscal pressures, we continue to see opportunities to apply our cost-effective and efficient solutions in the federal market. Federal agencies are tasked with cost-effectively managing programs at a time when changing demographics are leading to rising caseloads in many federal programs. 

Many federal agencies must also address the maintenance of legacy systems and the pressing need for infrastructure as IT modernization continues to grow. Legacy processes and systems are fundamental to government operations, yet they are unsustainably expensive to operate in an environment that requires online agility and rapid response to new demands, requirements and global challenges. We are in a prime position to help agencies modernize and operate their mission-critical systems. 

The implementation of the ACA also continues to impact the federal landscape. The ACA requires an independent, evidence-based external review process and the option for individuals to appeal coverage determinations or claims to insurance companies. We are one of the largest providers of evidence-based health insurance appeals to Medicare and 55 state agencies. We are also presently managing the eligibility appeals process for the Federally Facilitated Marketplace. As previously mentioned, President-elect Trump's campaign platform included a goal to repeal and replace the ACA. The factors that drove the passage of the ACA are still present we believe we are well-positioned to assist the new administration and the federal government in any repeal, replacement or modification of the ACA. 

Other key factors that will likely impact the U.S. federal market include a variety of political, economic, social and technological issues: 

&#8226; 

A focus on the citizen experience and citizen services, as well as digital services; 

&#8226; 

Legacy to modernization through case management; 

&#8226; 

Agencies moving from transformation initiatives to operations and maintenance; 

&#8226; 

Agencies seeking consolidation and shared services to achieve cost efficiencies; 

&#8226; 

Changes in the acquisition and contracting environment, including consolidation of GSA schedules; and 

&#8226; 

Limited program and procurement activity following the November 2016 presidential election as a result of the new administration. 

Human Services Market Environment 

We believe we are well-positioned to compete for opportunities in Human Services because of our established presence, strong brand recognition, and ability to achieve the requisite performance requirements and outcomes outlined in the new reform measures. We offer clients demonstrated results and decades of proven experience in administering welfare-to-work programs in several states and countries. 

We provide comprehensive welfare-to-work case management services throughout the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. In Australia, we are one of the largest welfare-to-work providers. We also have an established presence in the U.K.'s welfare-to-work market and presently provide employment and job training services under the Work Programme, a key component of the coalition government's austerity plan to rein in costly benefits programs and reduce mounting debt. 

Through our acquisition of Remploy in the U.K., we have increased our presence in the disability employment services market where we help people with disabilities and health conditions obtain mainstream employment. We believe these services are transferrable to our other geographies and position us well for emerging trends in the disability services market. 

In addition to ongoing welfare to work programs, we have seen an increase in initiatives to use private firms for children's services, such as family maintenance and child support. We currently provide services to the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program in British Columbia, as well as several jurisdictions throughout the U.S., including Shelby County, Tennessee and Baltimore, Maryland, two of the largest child support privatization efforts in the nation. 

We believe ongoing initiatives and measures to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, combined with our outstanding performance, expertise and proven solutions, will continue to drive demand for our core services across multiple geographies. 

Our growth strategy 

Our goal is to enable future growth by remaining a leading provider of business process services (BPS), technology solutions and consulting services to government agencies. The key components of our business growth strategy include the following: 

Pursue new business opportunities and expand our customer base. With more than 40 years of business expertise in the government market, we continue to be a leader in developing innovative solutions to meet the evolving needs of government agencies. We seek to grow our businesses by leveraging our existing core capabilities, consistently delivering the required outcomes for governments to achieve program goals, and pursuing opportunities with new and current clients. 

Grow long-term, recurring revenue streams. We seek to enter into long-term relationships with clients to meet their ongoing objectives. As a result, long-term contracts (three to five years with additional option years) are often the preferred method of delivery for clients and provide us with predictable recurring revenue streams. We believe an incumbent has a considerable advantage in recompetes and that client relationships can last for decades. 

Pursue strategic acquisitions. We will selectively identify and pursue strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions can provide us with a rapid and cost-effective method to enhance our services. This includes obtaining additional skill sets, increasing our access to contract vehicles, expanding our client base, cross-selling additional services, enhancing our technical capabilities, and establishing or expanding our geographic presence. 

Continue to optimize our current operations to drive innovation and quality to clients. We continue to seek efficiencies and optimize operations in order to achieve sustainable, profitable growth. We will continue to deliver quality BPS to government clients to improve the cost effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of their programs as they deal with rising demand and increasing caseloads. 

Recruit and retain highly skilled professionals. We continually strive to recruit motivated individuals, including top managers from larger organizations, former government officials, consultants experienced in our service areas and recent college graduates with degrees aligned with our mission, such as degrees in government policy and administration. We believe we can continue to attract and retain experienced and educated personnel by capitalizing on our focused market approach and our reputation as a premier government services provider. 

Focus on core health, U.S. federal civilian and human services business lines. We have centered our core business offerings on delivering BPS to government health and human services agencies in our primary geographies as well as to other civilian agencies within the U.S. Federal Government. Our market focus and established presence positions us to benefit from health care and welfare reform initiatives both in the U.S. and internationally. 

See Exhibit 99.1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption "Special Considerations and Risk Factors" for information on risks and uncertainties that could affect our business growth strategy. 

Competitive advantages 

We offer a private sector alternative for the operation and management of critical government-funded health and human services programs. Our reputation and extensive experience give us a competitive advantage as governments value the level of expertise, proven delivery and brand recognition that we bring to our clients. The following are the competitive advantages that allow us to capitalize on various market opportunities: 

Proven track record, ability to deliver outcomes and exceptional brand recognition. We assist governments in delivering cost-effective services to beneficiaries of government programs. We run large-scale program management operations on behalf of government agencies, improving the quality of services provided to their 

beneficiaries and achieving the necessary outcomes to help them cost-effectively meet their program goals. This has further enhanced our brand recognition as a proven partner with government agencies. 

Subject matter expertise. Our workforce includes many individuals who possess substantial subject matter expertise in areas critical to the successful design, implementation, administration and operation of government health and human services programs. Many of our employees have worked for governments in management positions and can offer insights into how we can best provide valuable, practical and effective services to our clients. 

Intellectual property that supports the administration of government programs. We have proprietary solutions to address client requirements in our market that are configurable or provide a platform that can be transferred to meet contractual needs. We leverage commercial off-the-shelf platforms across multiple contracts in which we have considerable expertise to ensure we can deploy repeatable proven solutions. We also leverage software development methodology to shorten software development cycles. Extensive use of shared infrastructure and standard solutions provides considerable price and quality advantages. We believe our extensive industry focus and expertise embedded in our systems and processes provide us with a competitive advantage. 

Flexibility and scalability. We are experienced in launching large-scale operations under compressed time frames. We offer clients the flexibility and scalability to deliver the people, processes and technology to complete short- and long-term contractual assignments in the most efficient and cost-effective manner. 

Financial strength. Our business provides us with robust cash flows from operating activities as a result of our profitability and our management of customer receivables. In the event that we have significant cash outlays at the commencement of projects, to fund acquisitions, or where delays in payments have resulted in short-term cash flow declines, we may borrow up to $400 million through our credit facility. We have the ability to borrow in all of the principal currencies in which we operate. We believe we have strong, constructive relationships with the lenders on our credit facility. We had $ 230.1 million &#32;available to borrow as of September 30, 2016. We believe our financial strength provides reassurance to government agencies that we will be able to establish and maintain the services they need to operate high-profile public health and human services. 

Focused portfolio of services. We are one of the largest publicly traded companies that provides a portfolio of BPS almost exclusively to government customers. Our government program expertise and proven ability to deliver defined, measurable outcomes differentiate us from other firms and non-profit organizations. This includes large consulting firms that serve multiple industries and lack the focus necessary to manage the complexities of serving government agencies efficiently. 

Established presence outside the United States. Governments outside the U.S. are seeking to improve government-sponsored health and human services programs, manage increasing caseloads, and contain costs. We have an established presence in the U.K., Australia, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Our international efforts are focused on delivering cost-effective welfare-to-work and health benefits services to program participants on behalf of governments. 

Expertise in competitive bidding. Government agencies typically award contracts through a comprehensive, complex and competitive request for proposals (RFP) and bidding process. Although the bidding criteria vary from contract to contract, typical contracts are awarded based upon a mix of technical solution and price. In some cases, governments award points for past performance tied to program outcomes. With more than 40 years of experience in responding to RFPs, we believe we have the necessary experience and resources to navigate government procurement processes and to assess and allocate the appropriate resources necessary for successful project completion in accordance with contractual terms. 

Our clients 

Our primary clients are government agencies, with the majority at the national, provincial and state level and, to a lesser extent, some at the county and municipal level. In the U.S., even when our direct clients are state governments, a significant amount of our revenue is ultimately provided by the U.S. Federal Government in the form of cost-sharing arrangements with the states, such as is the case with Medicaid. In the year ended September 30, 2016 , approximately 46% &#32;of our total revenue was derived from state government agencies, 26% &#32;from foreign government agencies, 22% &#32;from U.S. Federal Government agencies and 6% &#32;from other sources including local municipalities and commercial customers. 

&#32;In the event of a shutdown of the U.S. Federal Government, a portion of our U.S. Federal Services Segment may be impacted. Many of our federally funded health and human services programs are typically deemed 

essential, which means that a short-term shut-down would not be expected to cause significant disruption to these operations. With the acquisition of Acentia's business, our contract portfolio now contains services that may be considered discretionary. As a result, we could incur costs tied to portion of work that is considered discretionary with no certainty of recovery. In all cases, an extended delay may affect certain government programs that rely upon federal funding and may also have an effect on our cash flows if payments are delayed. 

For the year ended September 30, 2016 , our most significant clients were the U.S. Federal Government, which provided 22% &#32;of our consolidated revenue, the U.K. Government, which provided 16% , and the State of New York, which provided 12% . 

We typically contract with government clients under four primary pricing arrangements: performance-based, cost-plus, fixed-price and time-and-materials. For the year ended September 30, 2016 , 42% &#32;of our contracts were performance-based, 33% &#32;were cost-plus, 18% &#32;were fixed-price and 7% &#32;were time-and-materials. 

Generally, the relationships with our clients are longer-term and typical contracts, including option periods, tend to be several years long before they are subject to be competitively rebid. See the "Backlog" section below for more details. 

Competition 

The market for providing our services to government agencies is competitive and subject to rapid change. However, given the specialized nature of our services and the programs we serve, market entry can be difficult for new or inexperienced firms. The complex nature of competitive bidding, the required investment in subject-matter expertise, repeatable processes and support infrastructure, and the need to achieve specific program outcomes creates barriers to entry for potential new competitors unfamiliar with the nature of government procurement. 

In the U.S., our primary competitors in the Health Services Segment are Xerox, HP, Automated Health Systems and Faneuil. We consider ourselves to be a significant competitor in the markets in which we operate as we are the largest provider of Medicaid and CHIP administrative programs and operate more state-based health insurance exchanges than any other commercial provider. In the U.S. Federal Services Segment, our primary competitors in the BPS market are Serco, General Dynamics Information Technology and FCi. In the U.S. Federal Services Segment, our primary competitors in the technology sector tend to be IBM, Oracle, CSRA and other federal contractors. Our primary competitors in the Human Services Segment vary according to specific business line, but are primarily specialized consulting service providers and local non-profit organizations. 

Outside of the U.S., our primary competitors in the Health Services Segment include Atos, Capita, Interserve, Virgin Care and Optum. Our primary competitors in the Human Services Segment include Serco, Ingeus, a Providence Service Company, Staffline, Shaw Trust, Sarina Russon, Advanced Placement Management and other specialized private companies and non-profit organizations such as The Salvation Army and Goodwill Industries. Although the basis for competition varies from contract to contract, we believe that typical contracts are awarded based upon a mix of comprehensive solution and price. In some cases, clients award points for past performance tied to program outcomes. 

Legislative initiatives 

We actively monitor legislative initiatives and respond to opportunities as they develop. Over the past several years, legislative initiatives created new growth opportunities and potential markets for us. Legislation passed in all the geographies in which we operate has significant public policy implications for all levels of government and presents viable business opportunities in the health and human services arena. We are well-positioned to meet the operations program management and consulting needs resulting from that legislation and subsequent regulatory and program implementation efforts. 

Some legislative initiatives that have created new growth opportunities for MAXIMUS include: 

The Affordable Care Act (ACA). Enacted in 2010 and upheld through a Supreme Court decision in 2012, the ACA introduced comprehensive health care reform in the United States. MAXIMUS has helped states with the operation of their health insurance exchanges and the expansion of their Medicaid programs to include new populations, the integration of state eligibility processing for entitlement programs and new long-term services and supports initiatives that have introduced more flexibility for home- and community-based services. MAXIMUS has also assisted the federal government with the operations of a customer contact center for the Federal Marketplace and independent eligibility appeals services. 

The election of Donald Trump has renewed focus on the future of health care policy in the United States, including the future of the ACA. President-elect Trump's campaign platform included a goal to repeal and replace the ACA. The factors that drove the passage of the ACA, including the large number of Americans without health insurance, are still present and the Trump administration has articulated his interest to broaden health care, make it affordable, and improve its quality. We believe we are well-positioned to assist the new administration and the individual states in any repeal, replacement or modification of the ACA. We would anticipate that any such changes would not affect our results until after fiscal year 2017. We estimate that our work directly tied to the ACA is expected to contribute approximately $160 million to our revenue in fiscal year 2017. We also estimate that approximately $40 million &#32;in additional revenue is tied to Medicaid expansion activities in the states where we provide Medicaid services. 

Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA). CHIPRA was signed into law on February 2, 2009, extending the previous SCHIP program. As part of the ACA, CHIP has been extended through 2019. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) provides new federal funding for CHIP through 2017. By expanding state options to find and enroll eligible children through "express lane eligibility" and "auto enrollment," CHIPRA has presented MAXIMUS with an opportunity to expand our partnerships with states for the administration of CHIP programs. The advent of state and federal exchanges at the beginning of 2014 has increased participation of eligible children in CHIP. 

Medicaid and CHIP Managed Care Regulations. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) issued managed care regulations and federal standards for the Medicaid and Children&#8217;s Health Insurance programs. These include enhancing support for consumers, improving health care delivery and quality of care, providing greater access to health care, and ensuring a modern set of rules that better align with the marketplace and Medicare Advantage plans. They also reinforce ongoing efforts to modernize and streamline the enrollment process and the continued value of independent choice counseling. 

&#160; Work Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). Signed into law in July 2014, WIOA replaces the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and took effect on July 1, 2015. The law coordinates several core federal employment, training, education and literacy programs. It also requires states to strategically align their workforce development programs, with the option to include TANF, to help job seekers access the necessary support services and to match employers with skilled workers they need to compete in the global economy. WIOA represents potential new opportunities for us to complement our existing TANF welfare-to-work operations in the U.S. 

U.K. Health Assessment Advisory Service (formerly known as the Health and Disability Assessment Service). The Welfare Reform Act of 2007 replaced Incapacity Benefits with the Employment and Support Allowance and introduced the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). The WCA was designed to distinguish people who could not work due to health-related problems from people who were 'fit for work' or, with additional support, could eventually return to work. In 2010, the U.K. Government decided to reassess the 2.5 million people who had previously been determined to be eligible to receive Incapacity Benefits. The U.K. Government also decided that an independent health assessment provided by a vendor partner is the best method for the government to determine the level of benefits for individuals with long-term sickness or disabilities. MAXIMUS has been providing assessments through the resulting HAAS on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) since March 2015. 

U.K. Work Programme, Work Choice Programme and Work and Health Programme. The Work Programme is a government-sponsored welfare-to-work model that consolidates several existing employment programs into a single comprehensive back-to-work program in an effort to achieve higher quality, longer-term and sustainable employment outcomes for job seekers in the U.K. The Work Choice Programme is a voluntary, government-sponsored employment support program for people with disabilities. The U.K. Government has indicated that the two programs will be consolidated into the new Work and Health Programme with an increased focus on people with health conditions and disabilities. MAXIMUS expects that the scope of work under Work and Health will be smaller than the two previous contracts combined. 

Backlog 

At September 30, 2016 , we estimate that we had approximately $4.0 billion &#32;in backlog. Backlog represents an estimate of the remaining future revenue from existing signed base contracts and revenue from contracts that have been formally awarded, but not yet signed. Our backlog estimate includes revenue expected under the current terms of executed contracts and revenue from contracts in which the scope and duration of the services required are not definite but estimable (such as performance-based contracts). Our backlog estimate does not assume any contract renewals or option period exercises. 

Increases in backlog result from the award of new contracts, the extension or renewal of existing contracts and the exercise of option periods. Reductions in backlog come from fulfilling contracts or the early termination of contracts. The backlog associated with our performance-based contracts is an estimate based upon management's experience of caseloads and similar transaction volume from which actual results may vary. The Company may modify our estimates related to performance-based contracts and as a result backlog from these contracts may increase or decrease based upon the information that management has at that time. Additionally, backlog estimates may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations. 

Government contracts typically contain provisions permitting government clients to terminate contracts on short notice, with or without cause. 

We believe that period-to-period backlog comparisons are difficult and may not necessarily accurately reflect future revenue we may receive. The actual timing of revenue receipts, if any, on projects included in backlog could change for any of the aforementioned reasons. The dollar amount by segment of our backlog as of September 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;was as follows:

Our businesses typically involve contracts covering a number of years, including option periods. Once contracts are signed, they typically take three to six months to begin generating revenue. At September 30, 2016 , the average weighted life of these contracts was approximately 5 years, including option periods. Although the exercise of options is uncertain, we believe the incumbent contractor enjoys significant advantages and these options are exercised nearly 100% of the time. The longevity of these contracts assists management in predicting revenue, operating income and cash flows. We expect approximately 51% of the backlog balance to be realized as revenue in fiscal 2017 and, with the inclusion of anticipated option period renewals, to represent approximately 93% of current estimated 2017 revenue. Backlog was adjusted between September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016 for currency fluctuations and for estimated amounts associated with our performance-based contracts based upon the latest information that management has at that time. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016 , we had approximately 18,800 employees, consisting of 10,900 employees in the Health Services Segment, 3,500 employees in our U.S. Federal Services Segment, 4,000 employees in the Human Services Segment and 400 corporate administrative employees. Our success depends in large part on attracting, retaining and motivating talented, innovative, experienced and educated professionals at all levels. 

As of September 30, 2016 , 417 of our employees in Canada were covered under three different collective bargaining agreements, each of which has different components and requirements. There are 408 employees covered by two collective bargaining agreements with the British Columbia Government and Services Employees' Union and nine employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Professional Employees Association. These collective bargaining agreements expire beginning in 2019 through 2020. 

As of September 30, 2016 , 1,795 of our employees in Australia were covered under a Collective Agreement, which is similar in form to a collective bargaining agreement. The Collective Agreement is renewed annually. 

As of September 30, 2016 , 746 of our employees in the U.K. were covered under four different collective bargaining agreements, each of which has different components and requirements. There are 153 employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Union Public and Commercial Services, five employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Union Prospect, and a total of 588 employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement with GMB Trade Union and Unite Amicus Trade Union. These collective bargaining agreements do not have expiration dates. 

None of our other employees are covered under any such agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
