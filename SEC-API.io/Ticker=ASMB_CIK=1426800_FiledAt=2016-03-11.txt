&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We are a biotechnology company advancing two innovative platform programs: a new class of oral therapeutics for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and novel class of oral biological therapeutics, which are designed to restore health to a dysbiotic microbiome. Our HBV-cure program is aimed at increasing the current low cure rates for patients with HBV and is pursuing several drug candidates that inhibit multiple viral targets throughout the HBV lifecycle. Assembly has discovered several novel core protein Allosteric Modulators (CpAMs), which are small molecules that directly target and allosterically modulate a number of HBc functions. Our Microbiome Program consists of a fully integrated platform that includes a robust strain identification and selection process, methods for strain isolation and growth under cGMP conditions, and a patent pending delivery system, GEMICEL TM , which allows for targeted oral delivery of live biologic and conventional therapies to the lower gastrointestinal, or GI tract. The lead program from this platform, AB-M101, is in development for the treatment of C. difficile- infections (CDI). Using its microbiome platform, the Company is developing additional product candidates.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Assembly is currently focused on advancing science and enhancing the health and well-being of patients with hard-to-treat infectious diseases by building a world class company focused on serious conditions that are inadequately treated. This commitment drives our efforts to forge a new and different path to treating these conditions, inspired by the needs of millions of affected patients with our platform technologies that may have the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional approaches. We have two promising proprietary technology platforms: a portfolio of novel, potentially curative CpAMs for HBV and a novel class of oral biological drugs designed to restore a dysbiotic microbiome. Both of these conditions include substantial numbers of patients with intractable disease who cannot be cured by current therapies. We intend to progress these programs using a variety of strategic arrangements, including potentially collaborations, licenses, partnerships and other types of business arrangements. These may provide non-dilutive funding for drug development, as well as clinical development and commercial expertise.

&#160;

HBV-Cure Program 

&#160; 

&#160;

The target of our HBV cure program is a clinical cure for hepatitis B virus, a pathogen that infects approximately 350 million people worldwide and is associated with an estimated 650,000 deaths each year. Our HBV-Cure research team is working on discovering and developing multiple CpAMs with the potential to modulate the HBV core protein &#8211; an essential polyfunctional viral protein - at multiple points in the viral lifecycle.

&#160;

HBc protein is involved in several steps of the HBV lifecycle and is essential for HBV&#8217;s continued regeneration and prolonged survival. Modulation of HBc with Assembly&#8217;s CpAMs has demonstrated preclinical proof of principle. In multiple cell-based models CpAMs selectively reduced viral load, which is the amount of infectious viral particles released from infected cells and modulated closed circular covalent DNA (cccDNA), a special DNA structure that arises in the cell nucleus of some viruses and is associated with viral persistence. Different CpAMs appear to have differentiated mechanisms, giving us a potential pipeline of differentiated early-stage products. This enables us to pursue both monotherapy and combination therapies that include molecules with differentiated mechanisms, potentially facilitating the achievement of improved cure rates. The goal is to eradicate the infection with an orally-administered regimen. We believe that Assembly is uniquely positioned to execute on this strategy, with a senior scientific team that has over 30 years of combined experience working on HBV.

&#160;

Background 

&#160; 

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a chronic infectious disease of the liver. It is a leading global cause of chronic liver disease and liver transplants. The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 350 million people worldwide, or approximately 6% of the world&#8217;s population, are infected with HBV. An estimated 10 to 30 million people are newly infected each year and 650,000 people die annually from HBV-related liver disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported that almost two million people in the United States have been infected with HBV. HBV is an underappreciated global epidemic with twice as many people infected and with a higher rate of mortality and morbidity than hepatitis C virus and HIV infections combined. While many HBV patients currently receive treatment, the majority do not, partly due to the lack of effective therapies. The cure rate with current therapies is estimated at only 3-5%. Despite the low rate of diagnosis and treatment, the current market for HBV therapies is estimated at $3.2 billion, with significant growth expected in the years ahead as more effective drugs are developed and launched.

&#160; 

1&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Current Treatments 

&#160; 

Current therapeutic options for HBV include:

&#160;

&#183; Antiviral medications. Several antiviral medications - including lamivudine (Epivir &#174; ), adefovir (Hepsera &#174; ), telbivudine (Tyzeka &#174; ) and entecavir (Baraclude &#174; ) &#8211; effectively reduce circulating virus. Chronic therapy with these agents results in reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis. Unfortunately, viral replication resumes when therapy is stopped. &#160; &#160; &#183; Interferon alfa-2b (Intron A). This synthetic version of a substance produced by the body to fight infection is used mainly for young people with hepatitis B who don't want to undergo long-term treatment or who might want to become pregnant within a few years. It is administered by injection. Side effects may include flu-like symptoms and depression. &#160;

Our HBV Focus: Leveraging HBV Core Protein to Achieve a Cure using Core Protein Allosteric Modulators (CpAMs) 

&#160;

HBV is a DNA-virus that establishes an intra-nuclear reservoir of cccDNA, which sustains infection in the liver through chronic and occult hepatitis B infection. No current oral therapies can target cccDNA activity directly, and thus orally available molecules that can modulate cccDNA are highly sought in the HBV field. A key focus of Assembly&#8217;s cure effort is the HBV Core protein (HBc), a highly conserved viral structural protein that has no human homologue and is involved in numerous aspects of the HBV lifecycle, including interaction with the viral cccDNA. Assembly has discovered multiple novel series of CpAMs, which are small molecules that directly target and allosterically modulate a number of HBc functions. Assembly&#8217;s HBV pipeline therefore offers the potential for both first in class and best in class opportunities for developing agents that target multiple aspects of the viral lifecycle, such as HBc/cccDNA interactions. We believe that our approaches to targeting multiple aspects of HBc provide a promising foundation for developing a clinical cure for HBV.

&#160;

To successfully eradicate HBV infections, researchers need to address both the &#8220;downstream&#8221; inhibition of HBV viral replication and the &#8220;upstream&#8221; part of the lifecycle that reflects cccDNA activity. We define downstream inhibition of the HBV lifecycle as targeting HBV from the point of formation of the viral capsid to the release of viral particles from the cell for re-infection. We believe that our ability to develop CpAMs that target multiple aspects of the viral lifecycle may allow us to develop combination regimens that achieve better cure rates by targeting both target &#8220;upstream&#8221; and &#8220;downstream&#8221; components. Other core competencies and competitive advantages we bring to our lead program include our knowledge of HBV biology, our proprietary enabling assays, our highly experienced chemistry and our relevant clinical expertise.

&#160;

A clinically and preclinically accepted benchmark for therapeutic agents aiming to affect cccDNA activity is the level of expression of several key viral antigens. On this basis, Assembly&#8217;s CpAMs have shown preclinical proof of principle. In a variety of cell culture models, CpAMs have demonstrated the ability to reduce production of viral antigens: HBV E antigen (HBeAg) and HBV S antigen (HBsAg). Sustained (post treatment) inhibition of HBsAg in patients is considered a functional cure, and is a key endpoint for clinical development.

&#160;

Our clinical strategy encompasses testing CpAMs as monotherapy and in combination. Our access to multiple classes of CpAMs allows us to explore their activity in combination across CpAM classes and with other classes of HBV therapies. Our planned clinical program will start with Phase I (safety) studies of CpAMs as single agents in healthy volunteers. Phase IB studies in patients would include assessments of CpAMs as single agents and in combination with approved therapies for HBV. The Phase II studies would explore duration of therapy in dose finding single agent and combination studies across CpAM classes and with other classes of therapy.

&#160;

Assembly is planning to complete its preclinical studies in 2016. Clinical trials with its first lead molecule are planned to commence in the second half of 2016. Assembly&#8217;s CpAM platform provides opportunities to create a pipeline encompassing multiple generations of antiviral drugs, and Assembly plans to advance second and third generation CpAMs into clinical development in 2017. Assembly also has research programs assessing other novel targets for HBV that are complementary to our programs focusing on Core protein.

&#160;

License Agreement and Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

On September 3, 2013, we entered into a license agreement (the &#8220;IURTC License Agreement&#8221;) with Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation (&#8220;IURTC&#8221;) to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize products associated with multiple patent applications covering aspects of our HBV program held by IURTC. The licensed intellectual property includes platform patent applications covering aspects of HBc, our novel mechanisms of action, methods of treatment and the novel drug development assays our team is creating. As part of this agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments based upon the successful accomplishment of clinical and regulatory milestones. The total amount of all potential future milestone payments at the end of 2015 was $825,000. None of the criteria for these milestones have yet been met. Under the IURTC License Agreement, we are also obligated to pay IURTC royalty payments based on net sales of the licensed technology ranging from 0.5% to 1.75%.

&#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, the IURTC License Agreement requires an annual diligence maintenance fee as follows:

&#160;

2015 &#160; $ 50,000 &#160; 2016 through the year in which first commercial sale occurs &#160; $ 75,000 &#160; Year following first commercial sale and all subsequent years &#160; $ 100,000 &#160; 

&#160;

We also have filed composition of matter patent applications for our novel CpAM agents. We expect to file additional patent applications going forward.

&#160; 

Microbiome Program Platform 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Background 

&#160;

Our Microbiome Program is based on the oral targeted delivery of novel microbiome-based therapies in a patent pending oral formulation, called Gemicel&#8482; applying our novel coating and encapsulation technology that allows for targeted delivery of complex agents to select regions of the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Using this proprietary delivery platform, we aim to deliver selected combinations of monoculture strains of beneficial bacteria in novel &#8220;synthetic formats&#8221; to the GI tract. Our first indication is recalcitrant CDI, and we plan to leverage our Microbiome program into multiple other areas of high relevance to gut microbiome disorders including other infectious disease and GI disorders, indications in Oncology, Diabetes, Obesity, other Metabolic disorders, and CNS disorders.

&#160;

Our approach builds upon experience reported in the literature of successfully treating CDI and other disease indications with fecal material transplants or FMT, and seeks to provide a potentially curative therapy using a far more &#8220;drug like&#8221; approach that delivers targeted and specific microbiome therapies in an oral capsule.

&#160;

CDI is our first indication. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of the human microbiome - the billions of microbes living in and on people - to impact health and disease. An early and obvious target was CDI, the most common nosocomial, or hospital acquired, infection, which has become a significant medical problem in hospitals and long-term care facilities as it becomes increasingly resistant to common antibiotics. CDI is estimated to afflict more than 500,000 people each year in the US alone. It is a serious illness resulting from infection of the inner lining of the colon by C. difficile bacteria, which produce toxins that cause inflammation, severe diarrhea and, in the most serious cases, death. Certain subpopulations, such as older patients, transplant patients, patients taking concomitant antibiotics and cancer patients, are at a higher risk of contracting CDI. Patients typically develop CDI from the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that disrupt normal gastrointestinal (gut) flora, thus allowing C. difficile bacteria to flourish unchecked and produce toxins. C. difficile is a spore-forming bacterium. Spores released into the hospital environment by patients with active disease can survive for months on dry surfaces in hospital rooms such as beds and doors. It also spreads when spores from other patients are transmitted on the hands and clothing of healthcare workers.

&#160; 

Current Treatments 

&#160; 

Current therapeutic options for CDI include fidaxomicin, oral vancomycin and the off-label use of metronidazole. However, approximately 35% of patients initially treated with these drugs either fail to respond or do not achieve a sustained response. About 50% of initially non-responsive patients fail to achieve a sustained response from second and third line treatment. Because of the difficulties in achieving a sustained response to treatment, we estimate that, in the U.S. alone, there are more than 800,000 treatments per year for CDI.

&#160; 

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Microbiome Therapies May Represent an Effective New Treatment Option for CDI 

&#160;

There has been considerable experience reported in the literature of successfully treating CDI with FMT from healthy individuals. FMT is believed to act by restoring a healthy balance of microbes in the gut. Despite its clinical efficacy, broad acceptance of FMT has been problematic, because of the possibility of unknown and potentially damaging constituents in human derived materials. Other options have been sought. Preliminary CDI studies using selected bacterial strains or bacterial spores from processed FMT have been promising. These reports have demonstrated a significant and growing precedent of successful cures in patients who had failed all prior treatment, and provide a path to potentially curative therapy using a targeted and specific microbiome therapy-one that can achieve the therapeutic benefits of FMT but in a form that is more predictable, safe and drug-like.

&#160;

Proof-of-concept for this approach was demonstrated using a preparation of fecal material from normal donors that contained only bacterial spores. In a U.S. Phase IB study, a single oral dose of spores administered in multiple capsules produced a 90% sustained response in 30 CDI patients who had failed three prior regimens. In addition, the carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria substantially declined in these patients. In another small study, a selection of 32 specific viral strains achieved a sustained response in two elderly patients with chronic refractory CDI.

&#160;

The concept has also been validated in animal studies. Several recent publications have demonstrated that administering even a few strains of bacteria may be sufficient to have a curative effect in mouse models of CDI, and one study suggested that even a single strain can be effective. In addition, testable mechanisms of how commensal bacteria may inhibit the growth and persistence of C. difficile have been reported or postulated.

&#160;

Our CDI program is based on the premise that an oral capsule containing specific bacteria grown in monoculture and manufactured under pharmaceutical-like GMP conditions (in effect a &#8216;synthetic&#8217; biologic product), has the potential to provide the therapeutic benefits of FMT therapy in a form that is economically viable and scalable for use in first line, as well as in second and third line treatment. In contrast, the commercial and clinical provision of whole or processed feces would require the provision of, or the purification and/or extraction from, human donor material, and as such is highly unlikely to be considered feasible except for a relatively small number of refractory CDI patients who have failed antibiotic treatment at least three times.

&#160;

However, the development of a &#8216;synthetic&#8217; bacterial product for the treatment of CDI, while promising, presents several basic challenges.

&#160;

The first challenge is the selection of bacterial strains likely to be effective. We believe that our ongoing bacterial discovery program enhances the probability that we will identify strains that will be effective in humans. This program involves collaboration with leading academic medical centers with relevant expertise, and includes special methods of identifying colonic strains from CDI patients receiving FMT, along with bioinformatic assessment of relevant data from resolved patients, and the isolation, culture, and screening of promising strains.

&#160;

A second challenge is the effective and reliable oral delivery of sufficient of organisms to the colon using a minimal number of capsules. To accomplish this, we in-licensed a delivery technology we call Gemicel TM . Gemicel is a novel coating and encapsulation technology that allows controlled delivery of an oral formulation specifically designated to achieve targeted fpulsed release to selected portions of the GI system tract by leveraging differences in their pH environments.

&#160;

We have demonstrated that our coating technology, which can be applied at body temperature ranges under aerobic or anaerobic conditions, does not cause any loss of a wide range of viable microorganisms. We have also demonstrated in vitro that, under conditions commonly accepted as representing conditions in each section of the GI tract lumen, the formulation can deliver its contents to the targeted sites. The results of a clinical scintigraphy study of Gemicel in healthy volunteers conducted in 2015 demonstrated that Gemicel can effectively release a bolus therapeutic payload at specific locations in the lower GI tract, including the ileum and ascending colon, two locations especially relevant for the treatment of C. difficile pathogens. The data were generated in three clinical cohorts that used radioisotope-based scintigraphy to precisely image the drug delivery properties of Gemicel.

&#160;

A third challenge is achieving successful process, scale up, and reliable and economic manufacture of the strains we select for use in CDI therapy for clinical trials and, ultimately, commercialization. The Assembly team has considerable experience in industrial scale production of bacteria under pharmaceutical-like Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) requirements, and there are several commercial scale vendors we have identified to facilitate this activity. However certain bacteria can be very difficult to freeze-dry (lyophilize) for encapsulation, and some can be very difficult to grow at a large scale. We believe that it is feasible to mitigate both clinical, regulatory and manufacturing risk by carefully selecting strains for clinical development that are effective in our preclinical assessments, that do not carry antibiotic resistance or virulence genes, and that can be lyophilized and grown at scale under standard anaerobic and/or aerobic conditions as required.

&#160;

We anticipate that our clinical development program for CDI using systematically selected, bacterial strains will encompass both first line as well as second and third line treatment. We expect that our first clinical trial will be in CDI patients who have relapsed after two or three standard antibiotic regimens. We will explore various regimens for further clinical development in these initial studies. We plan to complete our IND enabling studies in 2016 and then initiate Phase Ib study for our lead product candidate AB-M101, in the second half of 2016. 

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Depending on the progress and success of our CDI program we may decide to further leverage our discovery program and formulation technology to pursue other microbiome-related indications such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic diseases, as new data becomes available clarifying the relationship of the gut microbiome to these conditions.

&#160;

License Agreement and Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

On November 8, 2013, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Therabiome, LLC, for all intellectual property and know-how owned or controlled by Therabiome relating to the oral delivery of pharmaceutical drugs to specific sites in the intestine, using a pH sensitive release platform technology. Under the agreement, Therabiome granted Assembly the exclusive worldwide license, with rights to sublicense, to develop the intellectual property for commercialization (a) in the use of bacteria, complex proteins, viral antigens and small molecules by oral delivery in (i) gastro-intestinal dysbiosis, including but not limited to C. difficile infections , irritable bowel syndrome-constipation and inflammatory bowel disease, (ii) auto-immune disorders and autism, including but not limited to as controlled by bacteria or virus, and (iii) orally delivered vaccines, including viral and bacterial, and (b) any oral delivery of small molecules using the licensed intellectual property. We will be solely responsible for all research and development activities with respect to any product we develop under the license.

&#160;

For the license, we paid Therabiome an upfront non-refundable license fee of $300,000. In September 2014, we paid Therabiome $100,000 upon the occurrence of the first proof of principle for a bacteria strain. We will be required to pay an additional $100,000 upon the occurrence of the proof of principle for a virus. We must pay Therabiome clinical and regulatory milestones for each product or therapy advanced from the platform, for U.S. regulatory milestones, depending on whether the milestone occurs before the filing of the first new drug application, or NDA, for a product or after the first, second or third NDA filings, as follows:

&#160;

Regulatory and Clinical Milestones &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Upon the filing of an IND with the FDA: &#160; $100,000 - $130,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; First dose first patient - Phase I Clinical Trial &#160; $250,000 - $325,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; First dose first patient - Phase II Clinical Trial &#160; $500,000 - $650,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; First dose first patient - Phase III Clinical Trial &#160; $750,000 - $975,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Upon filing of an NDA or BLA with the FDA &#160; $1,000,000 - $1,300,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Upon marketing approval by the FDA &#160; $3,000,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Upon approval of a supplemental NDA (sNDA) for a new Indication, in the U.S &#160; $1,000,000 &#160; &#160; &#160;

We also must pay Therabiome lesser amounts for foreign regulatory milestones, which vary by country and region, and which depend on whether the milestone occurs before the filing of the first NDA filing or after the first, second or third NDA filings. These payments will be: one-third of the U.S. milestones paid upon a foreign equivalent of an investigational new drug application, or IND and marketing approval for each product in the European Union or Japan; 10% of the U.S. milestones paid upon a foreign equivalent of an IND and marketing approval for each product in China; 10% of the U.S. milestone paid upon marketing approval for each product in India and Brazil; and 1% of the U.S. milestone paid upon marketing approval for each product in all other countries. We also must pay Therabiome royalties on annual net product sales in the low to mid-single digit percentages plus, once annual net sales exceed two specified thresholds, a one-time cash payment upon reaching each threshold. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.

&#160; 

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

U.S. drug approval process 

&#160;

In the U.S, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.

&#160;

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; &#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#160; &#8226; approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; &#160; &#8226; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication; &#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA; &#160; &#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and &#160; &#8226; FDA review and approval of the NDA. &#160; 

Preclinical Studies and IND 

&#160;

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug application (IND). Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

&#160; 

Clinical trials 

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. &#160; &#8226; Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. &#160; &#8226; Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. &#160;

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Additionally, IND safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from animal or in vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk in humans, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

&#160; 

Marketing approval 

&#160;

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2,374,200 and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,450 per product and $585,200 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.

&#160;

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most applications for non-priority products within 10 months, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

&#160;

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted.

&#160;

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each trial may take many years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products.

&#160;

After the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Fast track designation 

&#160;

The FDA is required to facilitate and expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request.

&#160;

In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#8217;s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#8217;s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

&#160; 

Priority review 

&#160;

Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, a review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is received. Products regulated by the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, are eligible for priority review if they are intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and provide a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A fast track designated product candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA&#8217;s criteria for priority review.

&#160; 

Accelerated approval 

&#160;

Under the FDA&#8217;s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

&#160; 

Breakthrough therapy designation 

&#160;

Under the provisions of the new Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a &#8220;breakthrough therapy.&#8221; A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies also may be eligible for priority review. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.

&#160; 

Orphan drugs 

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product and indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity &#8212; if it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Pediatric information 

&#160;

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A sponsor of a new drug also is required to submit to the FDA a pediatric study plan generally 60 days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the agency. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation.

&#160; 

Combination products 

&#160;

The FDA regulates combinations of products that cross FDA centers, such as drug, biologic or medical device components that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined into a single entity, as a combination product. The FDA center with primary jurisdiction for the combination product will take the lead in the premarket review of the product, with the other center consulting or collaborating with the lead center.

&#160;

The FDA&#8217;s Office of Combination Products, or OCP, determines which center will have primary jurisdiction for the combination product based on the combination product&#8217;s &#8220;primary mode of action.&#8221; A mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. The primary mode of action is the mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, or the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.

&#160;

Often it is difficult for the OCP to determine with reasonable certainty the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. In those difficult cases, the OCP will consider consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions, or which center has the most expertise to evaluate the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product.

&#160;

A sponsor may use a voluntary formal process, known as a Request for Designation, when the product classification is unclear or in dispute, to obtain a binding decision as to which center will regulate the combination product. If the sponsor objects to that decision, it may request that the agency reconsider that decision.

&#160; 

Other regulatory requirements 

&#160;

Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval.

&#160;

The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMs, as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

&#160;

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

&#160;

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; &#160; &#8226; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; &#160; &#8226; refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; &#160; &#8226; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or &#160; &#8226; consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. &#160;

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.

&#160; 

Additional provisions 

&#160;

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.

&#160;

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

&#160; 

Physician Drug Samples 

&#160;

As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians, as well as prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation 

&#160;

In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

&#160; 

10&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

New Legislation and Regulations 

&#160;

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

&#160;

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.

&#160;

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the trials required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

&#160;

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.

&#160;

Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of us placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.

&#160;

The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the U.S. in March 2010 and contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal health care programs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is very competitive and the development and commercialization of new drugs and biologics is influenced by rapid technological developments and innovation. We face competition from several companies developing and commercializing products that will be competitive with our drug candidates, including large pharmaceutical and smaller biotechnology companies. Additionally, new entrants may potentially enter the market. For our HBV cure program, potential competitors include Johnson &#38; Johnson, Roche, Bristol Myers Squibb Co., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Gilead Sciences Inc., and Arbutus Biopharma Corp., among others. Additionally, we may face competition from currently available treatments for HBV. For CDI, our microbiome program&#8217;s first indication, our competitors include Seres Therapeutics, Inc. and Merck &#38; Co, Inc. For our microbiome program more generally, our competitors include Johnson &#38; Johnson, Novartis International AG, Abbvie Inc. and Pfizer Inc. Some of the competitive development programs from these companies may be based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approach, and others may be based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of products similar to ours or that otherwise target indications that we are pursuing.

&#160;

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize.

&#160;

Financial Information 

&#160;

We have not derived any revenue from product sales to date as it currently has no products. &#160; 

&#160; 

Research and Development Expense 

&#160;

Our research and development expenses, excluding stock-based compensation expense, was $15,100,205 for fiscal year 2015, of which $10,810,517 was expended on the HBV Program and $4,296,309 was expended on our Microbiome Program, offset by $6,621 credit due to termination of VEN 307 study in 2014.
