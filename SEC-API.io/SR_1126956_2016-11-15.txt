 Item 1. Business 

OVERVIEW 

Spire Inc. (Spire or the Company) was formerly The Laclede Group, Inc., an entity formed in 2000 that, effective October 1, 2001, became the public utility holding company for Laclede Gas Company (Laclede Gas or the Missouri Utilities). Laclede Gas was founded in 1857 as The Laclede Gas Light Company and it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1889, making the Company successor to the eighth longest listed stock on the NYSE. The Laclede Gas Light Company was renamed Laclede Gas Company in 1950. 

Spire is committed to transforming its business and pursuing growth by 1) growing its gas utility business through prudent investment in infrastructure upgrades and organic growth initiatives, 2) acquiring and integrating gas utilities, 3) modernizing its gas assets, and 4) investing in innovation. 

The Company has two key business segments: Gas Utility and Gas Marketing. 

The Gas Utility segment includes the regulated operations of Laclede Gas, Alabama Gas Corporation (Alagasco), and EnergySouth, Inc. (EnergySouth) (collectively, the Utilities). The business of the Utilities is subject to seasonal fluctuations with the peak period occurring in the winter heating season, typically November through April of each fiscal year. Laclede Gas, a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas, is the largest natural gas distribution utility system in Missouri, serving more than 1.1 million residential, commercial and industrial customers, and is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Laclede Gas serves St. Louis and eastern Missouri and, through Missouri Gas Energy (MGE), Kansas City and western Missouri. Alagasco is a public utility engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas principally in central and northern Alabama, serving more than 0.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers with primary offices located in Birmingham, Alabama. The Company purchased 100% of the common shares of Alagasco from Energen Corporation (Energen) effective on August 31, 2014. Mobile Gas Service Corporation (Mobile Gas) and Willmut Gas and Oil Company (Willmut Gas) are utilities engaged in the purchase, retail distribution and sale of natural gas to 0.1 million customers in southern Alabama and south central Mississippi. Mobile Gas and Willmut Gas are wholly owned subsidiaries of EnergySouth. The Company purchased 100% of the common shares of EnergySouth from Sempra U.S. Gas &#38; Power, LLC, a subsidiary of Sempra Global (Sempra), on September 12, 2016. 

The Gas Marketing segment includes Laclede Energy Resources, Inc. (LER), a wholly owned subsidiary engaged in the marketing of natural gas and related activities on a non-regulated basis. 

As of September 30, 2016 , Spire had 3,296 employees, Laclede Gas had 2,229 employees, and Alagasco had 825 employees. 

Consolidated operating revenues contributed by each segment for the last three fiscal years are presented below. For more detailed financial information regarding the segments, see Note 14 , Information by Operating Segment, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. (In millions)

GAS UTILITY 

Natural Gas Supply 

The Utilities&#8217; fundamental gas supply strategy is to meet the two-fold objective of 1) ensuring a dependable gas supply is available for delivery when needed and 2) insofar as is compatible with that dependability, purchasing gas that is economically priced. In structuring their natural gas supply portfolio, the Utilities focus on natural gas assets that are strategically positioned to meet the Utilities&#8217; primary objectives. 

Laclede Gas focuses its gas supply portfolio around a number of large natural gas suppliers with equity ownership or control of assets strategically situated to complement its regionally diverse firm transportation arrangements. In eastern Missouri, Laclede Gas utilizes both Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast gas sources to provide a level of supply diversity that facilitates the optimization of pricing differentials as well as protecting against the potential of regional supply disruptions. In western Missouri, both Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain gas sources are utilized by MGE to provide a level of supply diversity that accesses low cost supplies. 

In fiscal year 2016 , Laclede Gas purchased natural gas from 35 different suppliers to meet its total service area current gas sales and storage injection requirements. Laclede Gas entered into firm agreements with suppliers including major producers and marketers providing flexibility to meet the temperature sensitive needs of its customers. Natural gas purchased by Laclede Gas for delivery to its service area through the Enable Mississippi River Transmission LLC (MRT) system totaled 47.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf). Laclede Gas also holds firm transportation on several other interstate pipeline systems that provide access to gas supplies upstream of MRT. In addition to natural gas deliveries from MRT, 48.2 Bcf was purchased on the Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, Inc. (Southern Star), 4.7 Bcf was purchased on the Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC (TGIT) system, 10.4 Bcf was purchased on the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, LP (PEPL) system, and 0.6 Bcf was purchased on the Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC (REX) system. Some of Laclede Gas&#8217; commercial and industrial customers purchased their own gas with Laclede Gas transporting 48.8 Bcf to them through its distribution system. 

The fiscal year 2016 &#32;peak day send out of natural gas to Laclede Gas customers in both eastern and western Missouri, including transportation customers, occurred on January 17, 2016. The average temperature was 11 degrees Fahrenheit in St. Louis and 8 degrees Fahrenheit in Kansas City. On that day, the Missouri Utilities&#8217; customers consumed 1.55 Bcf of natural gas. For eastern Missouri, about 77% of this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to St. Louis through the MRT, MoGas Pipeline LLC, and Southern Star transportation systems, and the other 23% was met from Laclede Gas&#8217; on-system storage and peak shaving resources. For western Missouri, this peak day demand was met with natural gas transported to Kansas City through the Southern Star, PEPL, TGIT, and REX transportation systems. 

Alagasco&#8217;s distribution system is connected to two major interstate natural gas pipeline systems, Southern Natural Gas Company, L.L.C. (Southern Natural Gas) and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco). It is also connected to two intrastate natural gas pipeline systems. 

Alagasco purchases natural gas from various natural gas producers and marketers. Certain volumes are purchased under firm contractual commitments with other volumes purchased on a spot market basis. The purchased volumes are delivered to Alagasco&#8217;s system using a variety of firm transportation, interruptible transportation and storage capacity arrangements designed to meet the system&#8217;s varying levels of demand. 

In fiscal year 2016, Alagasco purchased natural gas from 15 different suppliers to meet current gas sales, storage injection, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) liquefaction requirements, of which seven are under long-term supply agreements. Approximately 59.5 Bcf was transported by Southern Natural Gas, 4.3 Bcf by Transco, and 5.2 Bcf through intrastate pipelines to the Alagasco delivery points for its residential, commercial, and industrial customers. 

The fiscal year 2016 peak day send out for Alagasco was 0.5 Bcf on January 23, 2016, when the average temperature was 30 degrees Fahrenheit in Birmingham, of which 100% was met with supplies transported through Southern Natural Gas, Transco and intrastate facilities, while supplies from Alagasco&#8217;s four LNG peak shaving facilities were not required. 

Mobile Gas&#8217; distribution system is directly connected to interstate pipelines, natural gas processing plants and gas storage facilities. Mobile Gas buys from a variety of producers and marketers, with BP Energy Company being the primary supplier. 

Natural Gas Storage 

For its eastern service area, Laclede Gas has a contractual right to store 21.6 Bcf of gas in MRT&#8217;s storage facility located in Unionville, Louisiana, and for its western service area 16.3 Bcf of gas storage in Southern Star&#8217;s system storage facilities located in Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as 1.4 Bcf of firm storage on PEPL&#8217;s system storage. MRT&#8217;s tariffs allow injections into storage from May 16 through November 15 and require the withdrawal from storage of all but 2.1 Bcf from November 16 through May 15. Southern Star tariffs allow both injections and withdrawals into storage year round with ratchets that restrict the associated flows dependent upon the underlying inventory level per the contracts. 

In addition, in eastern Missouri, Laclede Gas supplements pipeline gas with natural gas withdrawn from its own underground storage field located in St. Louis and St. Charles Counties in Missouri. The field is designed to provide approximately 0.3 Bcf of natural gas withdrawals on a peak day and maximum annual net withdrawals of approximately 4.0 Bcf of natural gas based on the inventory level that Laclede Gas plans to maintain. 

Alagasco has a contractual right to store 12.5 Bcf of gas with Southern Natural Gas, 0.2 Bcf of gas with Transco and 0.2 Bcf of gas with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. In addition, Alagasco has 1.8 Bcf of LNG storage that can provide the system with up to an additional 0.2 Bcf of natural gas daily to meet peak day demand. 

Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP, at multiple interconnections, provides No-Notice Service which includes 240,000 Dth of storage capacity to Mobile Gas. Through a direct connection with Sempra&#8217;s Bay Gas Storage, Mobile Gas has 800,000 Dth of maximum storage and 80,000 Dth of maximum daily withdrawal. 

Regulatory Matters 

For details on regulatory matters, see Note 15 , Regulatory Matters, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 

Other Pertinent Matters 

Laclede Gas is the only distributor of natural gas within its franchised service areas, while Alagasco is the main distributor of natural gas in its service areas. The principal competition for the Utilities comes from the local electric companies. Other competitors in the service areas include suppliers of fuel oil, coal, propane, natural gas pipelines that can directly connect to large volume customers, for the Missouri Utilities, district steam systems in the downtown areas of both St. Louis and Kansas City, and for Alagasco, from municipally or publicly owned gas distributors located adjacent to its service territory. Coal is price competitive as a fuel source for very large boiler plant loads, but environmental requirements for coal have shifted the economic advantage to natural gas. Oil and propane can be used to fuel boiler loads and certain direct-fired process applications, but these fuels require on-site storage, thus limiting their competitiveness. In certain cases, district steam has been competitive with gas for downtown St. Louis and Kansas City area heating users. 

Laclede Gas&#8217; residential, commercial, and small industrial markets represented approximately 91% of its operating revenue for fiscal 2016. Alagasco&#8217;s residential, commercial, and small industrial markets represented approximately 78% of its operating revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016. Given the current level of natural gas supply and market conditions, the Utilities believe that the relative comparison of natural gas equipment and operating costs with those of competitive fuels will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, and that these markets will continue to be supplied by natural gas. In new multi-family and commercial rental markets, the Utilities&#8217; competitive exposures are presently limited to space and water heating applications. Certain alternative heating systems can be cost competitive in traditional markets. 

Laclede Gas offers gas transportation service to its large-user industrial and commercial customers. The tariff approved for that type of service produces a margin similar to that which the Missouri Utilities would have received under their regular sales rates. Alagasco&#8217;s transportation tariff allows it to transport gas for large commercial and industrial customers rather than buying and reselling it to them and is based on Alagasco&#8217;s sales profit margin so 

that operating margins are unaffected. During fiscal 2016, substantially all of Alagasco&#8217;s large commercial and industrial customer deliveries involved the transportation of customer-owned gas. 

The Utilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that, to date, have not materially affected the Utilities&#8217; or the Company&#8217;s financial position and results of operations. For a detailed discussion of environmental matters, see Note 16 , Commitment and Contingencies, of the Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. 

Union Agreements 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 1,975 employees represented by organized labor unions. The Company believes labor relations with its employees are good. Should that condition change, the Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s results of operations and cash flows.

Total annual average number of customers for Laclede Gas and Alagasco for fiscal 2016 &#32;was 1,155,048 and 420,497, respectively. 

Laclede Gas has franchises in nearly all the communities where it provides service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. Generally, a franchise allows Laclede Gas, among other things, to install pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Laclede Gas&#8217; current public utility businesses in the state of Missouri. In recent years, although certain franchise agreements have expired, including Clayton, North Kansas City, Cameron, and Riverside, Laclede Gas has continued to provide service in those communities without formal franchises. 

Alagasco has franchises in nearly all the communities where it provides service with terms varying from five years to an indefinite duration. Generally, a franchise allows Alagasco, among other things, to install pipes and construct other facilities in the community. All of the franchises are free from unduly burdensome restrictions and are adequate for the conduct of Alagasco&#8217;s current public utility business in the state of Alabama. 

GAS MARKETING 

LER is engaged in the marketing of natural gas and providing energy services to both on-system utility transportation customers and customers outside of the Utilities&#8217; traditional service areas. During fiscal year 2016, Gas Marketing utilized 30 interstate and intrastate pipelines and over 125 suppliers to market natural gas to more than 200 retail customers and 120 wholesale customers, primarily in the central US. Through its retail operations, LER offers natural gas marketing services to large commercial and industrial customers, while its wholesale business consists of producers, pipelines, power generators, municipalities, storage operators, and utility companies. Wholesale activities currently represent a majority of the total Gas Marketing business. 

In the course of its business, LER enters into agreements to purchase natural gas at a future date in order to lock up supply to cover future sales commitments to its customers. To secure access to the markets it serves, LER contracts 

for transportation capacity on various pipelines from both pipeline companies and through the secondary capacity market from third parties. Throughout fiscal year 2016, this business held approximately 0.4 Bcf per day of firm transportation capacity. In addition, to ensure reliability of service and to provide operational flexibility, LER enters into firm storage contracts and interruptible park and loan transactions with various companies, where it is able to buy and retain gas to be delivered at a future date, at which time it sells the natural gas to third parties. As of September 30, 2016, Gas Marketing has contracted for approximately 5.4 Bcf of such storage and park and loan capacity for the 2016-2017 winter period. 

The Gas Marketing strategy is to leverage its market expertise and risk management skills to manage and optimize the value of its portfolio of commodity, transportation, park and loan, and storage contracts while controlling costs and acting on new marketplace opportunities. Overall, Gas Marketing saw significant growth in volumes in 2016 primarily due to increased business with producers and power generators and was also able to take advantage of the flexibility that its overall portfolio of assets provided. 

OTHER 

The principal drivers of the Other results for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 has been interest expense related to the 2014 debt issue to finance the Alagasco acquisition and other expenses attributable to acquisition transactions and integration. 

Other also includes Laclede Pipeline Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire, which operates a propane pipeline under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction. This pipeline allows Laclede Gas to receive propane that may be used to supplement its natural gas supply and meet peak demands on its distribution system. Laclede Pipeline Company also provides propane transportation services to third parties. 

Further, Other includes Spire STL Pipeline LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Spire that is planning construction of a 70-mile pipeline to connect to the Rockies Express Pipeline in Scott County, Illinois and end in St. Louis County, Missouri. The proposed pipeline, which will operate under FERC jurisdiction, will be capable of delivering up to 400,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas into eastern Missouri, and Laclede Gas is anticipated to be the foundational shipper. 

Additionally, this category includes Spire&#8217;s subsidiaries that are engaged in compression of natural gas and risk management, among other activities.
