The 243 inland towboats, 73 coastal tugboats, seven offshore tugboats and one docking tugboat provide the power source and the 898 inland tank barges, 70 coastal tank barges and six offshore dry-bulk cargo barges provide the freight capacity for the marine transportation segment. When the power source and freight capacity are combined, the unit is called a tow. The Company&#8217;s inland tows generally consist of one towboat and from one to 25 tank barges, depending upon the horsepower of the towboat, the river or canal capacity and conditions, and customer requirements. The Company&#8217;s coastal and offshore tows primarily consist of one tugboat and one tank barge or dry-bulk cargo barge.

Marine Transportation Industry Fundamentals

The United States inland waterway system, composed of a network of interconnected rivers and canals that serve the nation as water highways, is one of the world&#8217;s most efficient transportation systems. The nation&#8217;s inland waterways are vital to the United States distribution system, with over 1.1 billion short tons of cargo moved annually on United States shallow draft waterways. The inland waterway system extends approximately 26,000 miles, 12,000 miles of which are generally considered significant for domestic commerce, through 38 states, with 635 shallow draft ports. These navigable inland waterways link the United States heartland to the world.

The United States coastal system consists of ports along the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts, as well as ports in Alaska, Hawaii and on the Great Lakes. Like the inland waterways, the coastal trade is vital to the United States distribution system, particularly the regional distribution of refined petroleum products from refineries and storage facilities to a variety of destinations, including other refineries, distribution terminals, power plants and ships. In addition to distribution directly from refineries and storage facilities, coastal tank barges are used frequently to distribute products from pipelines. Many coastal markets receive refined petroleum products principally from coastal tank barges. Smaller volumes of petrochemicals are distributed from Gulf Coast plants to end users and black oil, including crude oil and natural gas condensate, is distributed regionally from refineries and terminals along the United States coast to refineries, power plants and distribution terminals.

Based on cost and safety, barge transportation is often the most efficient and safest means of transporting bulk commodities when compared with railroads and trucks. The cargo capacity of a 27,500 barrel inland tank barge is the equivalent of 46 railroad tank cars or 144 tractor-trailer tank trucks. A typical Company lower Mississippi River linehaul tow of 15 barges has the carrying capacity of approximately 216 railroad tank cars plus six locomotives, or approximately 1,050 tractor-trailer tank trucks. The Company&#8217;s inland tank barge fleet capacity of 17.9 million barrels equates to approximately 30,000 railroad tank cars or approximately 93,900 tractor-trailer tank trucks. Furthermore, barging is much more energy efficient. One ton of bulk product can be carried 616 miles by inland barge on one gallon of fuel, compared with 478 miles by railcar or 150 miles by truck. In the coastal trade, the carrying capacity of a 100,000 barrel tank barge is the equivalent of approximately 165 railroad tank cars or approximately 525 tractor-trailer tank trucks. The Company&#8217;s coastal tank barge fleet capacity of 6.0 million barrels equates to approximately 9,800 railroad tank cars or approximately 31,300 tractor-trailer tank trucks.

Tank barge transportation is safer than most modes of transportation in the United States. Marine transportation generally involves less urban exposure than railroad or truck transportation and operates on a system with few crossing junctures and in areas relatively remote from population centers. These factors generally reduce both the number and impact of waterway incidents.

Inland Tank Barge Industry

The Company operates within the United States inland tank barge industry, a diverse and independent mixture of large integrated transportation companies and small operators, as well as captive fleets owned by United States refining and petrochemical companies. The inland tank barge industry provides marine transportation of bulk liquid cargoes for customers and, in the case of captives, for their own account, throughout the Mississippi River and its tributaries and on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The most significant markets in this industry include the transportation of petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals. The Company operates in each of these markets. The use of marine transportation by the petroleum and petrochemical industry is a major reason for the location of United States refineries and petrochemical facilities on navigable inland waterways. Texas and Louisiana currently account for approximately 80% of the United States production of petrochemicals. Much of the United States farm belt is likewise situated with access to the inland waterway system, relying on marine transportation of farm products, including agricultural chemicals. The Company&#8217;s principal distribution system encompasses the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from Brownsville, Texas, to Port St. Joe, Florida, the Mississippi River System and the Houston Ship Channel. The Mississippi River System includes the Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Red, Tennessee, Yazoo, Ouachita and Black Warrior Rivers and the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway.

&#160;

The number of tank barges that operate on the inland waterways of the United States declined from an estimated 4,200 in 1982 to 2,900 in 1993, remained relatively constant at 2,900 until 2002, decreased to 2,750 from 2002 through 2006, and then increased over the years to approximately 3,850 by the end of 2015. The Company believes the decrease from 4,200 in 1982 to 2,750 in 2006 primarily resulted from: the increasing age of the domestic tank barge fleet, resulting in scrapping; rates inadequate to justify new construction; a reduction in tax incentives, which previously encouraged speculative construction of new equipment; stringent operating standards to adequately cope with safety and environmental risk; the elimination of government regulations and programs supporting the many new small refineries and a proliferation of oil traders which created a strong demand for tank barge services; an increase in the average capacity per barge; and an increase in environmental regulations that mandate expensive equipment modification, which some owners were unwilling or unable to undertake given capital constraints and the age of their fleets. The cost of tank barge hull work for required periodic United States Coast Guard (&#8220;USCG&#8221;) certifications, as well as general safety and environmental concerns, force operators to periodically reassess their ability to recover maintenance costs. The increase from 2,750 in 2006 to approximately 3,850 by the end of 2015 primarily resulted from increased barge construction and deferred retirements due to strong demand and resulting capacity shortages. The Company&#8217;s 898 inland tank barges represent approximately 23% of the industry&#8217;s 3,850 inland tank barges.

For 2013, the Company estimated that industry-wide 270 tank barges were placed in service and 70 tank barges were retired. For 2014, the Company estimated that industry-wide 300 tank barges were placed in service and 100 tank barges were retired. For 2015, the Company estimated that industry-wide 260 tank barges were placed in service and 60 tank barges were retired. During 2015, the decline in industry-wide demand for the movement of crude oil and natural gas condensate, and the subsequent transfer of inland crude oil barges to other tank barge markets, created some excess industry-wide tank barge capacity. As a result, the Company estimates that approximately 90 tank barges were ordered for delivery throughout 2016 and many older tank barges will be retired, dependent on 2016 market conditions. The risk of an oversupply of tank barges may be mitigated by continued increased petrochemical, black oil and refined petroleum products volumes and the fact that the inland tank barge industry has a mature fleet, with approximately 650 tank barges over 30 years old and approximately 250 of those over 40 years old, which may lead to retirement of older tank barges.

The average age of the nation&#8217;s inland tank barge fleet is approximately 15 years. Neither the Company, nor the industry, operates any single hull inland tank barges. Single hull tank barges were required by current federal law to either be retrofitted with double hulls or phased out of domestic service by December 31, 2014.

The Company&#8217;s inland marine transportation segment also owns a two-thirds interest in Osprey Line, L.L.C. (&#8220;Osprey&#8221;), a transporter of project cargoes and cargo containers by barge on the United States inland waterway system, as well as a 51% interest in a shifting operation and fleeting facility for dry cargo barges on the Houston Ship Channel.

Coastal Tank Barge Industry

The Company also operates in the United States coastal tank barge industry, operating tank barges in the 195,000 barrel or less category. This market is composed of approximately 15 large integrated transportation companies and small operators. The 195,000 barrel or less category coastal tank barge industry primarily provides regional marine transportation distribution of bulk liquid cargoes along the United States&#8217; Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts, in Alaska and Hawaii and, to a lesser extent, on the Great Lakes. Products transported are primarily refined petroleum products and black oil from refineries and storage facilities to a variety of destinations, including other refineries, distribution terminals, power plants and ships, the regional movement of crude oil and natural gas condensate to Gulf Coast, Northeast and West Coast refineries, and the movement of petrochemicals primarily from Gulf Coast petrochemical facilities to end users.

&#160;

The number of coastal tank barges that operate in the 195,000 barrel or less category is approximately 270, of which the Company operates 70 or approximately 26%. The average age of the nation&#8217;s coastal tank barge fleet is approximately 16 years. The coastal tank barge fleet is also mature, with approximately 45 tank barges over 30 years old and approximately 35 of those over 35 years old, which may lead to the retirement of older tank barges.

Competition in the Tank Barge Industry

The tank barge industry remains very competitive. Competition in this business has historically been based primarily on price; however, most of the industry&#8217;s customers, through an increased emphasis on safety, the environment, quality and a trend toward a &#8220;single source&#8221; supply of services, are more frequently requiring that their supplier of tank barge services have the capability to handle a variety of tank barge requirements. These requirements include distribution capability throughout the inland waterway system and coastal markets, with high levels of flexibility, safety, environmental responsibility and financial responsibility, as well as adequate insurance and high quality of service consistent with the customer&#8217;s own operational standards.

In the inland markets, the Company&#8217;s direct competitors are primarily noncaptive inland tank barge operators. &#8220;Captive&#8221; fleets are owned by major oil and petrochemical companies which occasionally compete in the inland tank barge market, but primarily transport cargoes for their own account. The Company is the largest inland tank barge carrier, both in terms of number of barges and total fleet barrel capacity. The Company&#8217;s inland tank barge fleet has grown from 71 tank barges in 1988 to 898 tank barges as of February 19, 2016, or approximately 23% of the estimated total number of domestic inland tank barges.

In the coastal markets, the Company&#8217;s direct competitors are the operators of United States tank barges in the 195,000 barrels or less category. Coastal tank barges in the 195,000 barrels or less category have the ability to enter the large majority of coastal ports. Ocean-going tank barges and United States refined petroleum products tankers, in the 300,000 barrels plus category, including the captive fleets of major oil companies, primarily move large volumes of refined petroleum products and crude oil from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. There are approximately 40 such vessels and, because of their size, their access to ports is limited by terminal size and draft restrictions.

While the Company competes primarily with other tank barge companies, it also competes with companies who operate refined product and petrochemical pipelines, railroad tank cars and tractor-trailer tank trucks. As noted above, the Company believes that both inland and coastal marine transportation of bulk liquid products enjoy a substantial cost advantage over railroad and truck transportation. The Company believes that refined product and crude oil pipelines, although often a less expensive form of transportation than inland and coastal tank barges, are not as adaptable to diverse products and are generally limited to fixed point-to-point distribution of commodities in high volumes over extended periods of time.

Products Transported

The Company transports petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals by tank barge throughout the Mississippi River System, on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, coastwise along all three United States coasts and in Alaska and Hawaii. During 2015, the Company&#8217;s inland marine transportation operation moved over 45 million tons of liquid cargo on the United States inland waterway system.

Petrochemicals. Bulk liquid petrochemicals transported include such products as benzene, styrene, methanol, acrylonitrile, xylene, naphtha and caustic soda, all consumed in the production of paper, fibers and plastics. Pressurized products, including butadiene, isobutane, propylene, butane and propane, all requiring pressurized conditions to remain in stable liquid form, are transported in pressure barges. The transportation of petrochemical products represented 47% of the segment&#8217;s 2015 revenues. Customers shipping these products are petrochemical and refining companies.

Black Oil. Black oil transported includes such products as residual fuel oil, No. 6 fuel oil, coker feedstock, vacuum gas oil, asphalt, carbon black feedstock, crude oil, natural gas condensate and ship bunkers (engine fuel). Such products represented 30% of the segment&#8217;s 2015 revenues. Black oil customers are refining companies, marketers and end users that require the transportation of black oil between refineries and storage terminals, to refineries and to power plants. Ship bunker customers are oil companies and oil traders in the bunkering business.

&#160;

Refined Petroleum Products. Refined petroleum products transported include the various blends of finished gasoline, gasoline blendstocks, jet fuel, No. 2 oil, heating oil and diesel fuel, and represented 20% of the segment&#8217;s 2015 revenues. The Company also classifies ethanol in the refined petroleum products category. Customers are oil and refining companies, marketers and ethanol producers.

Agricultural Chemicals. Agricultural chemicals transported represented 3% of the segment&#8217;s 2015 revenues. Agricultural chemicals include anhydrous ammonia and nitrogen-based liquid fertilizer, as well as industrial ammonia. Agricultural chemical customers consist mainly of domestic and foreign producers of such products.

Demand Drivers in the Tank Barge Industry

Demand for tank barge transportation services is driven by the production volumes of the bulk liquid commodities transported by barge. Marine transportation demand for the segment&#8217;s four primary commodity groups, petrochemicals, black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals, is based on differing circumstances. While the demand drivers of each commodity are different, the Company has the flexibility in certain cases of re-allocating inland equipment and coastal equipment between the petrochemical, refined petroleum products and crude oil markets as needed.

Bulk petrochemical volumes have historically tracked the general domestic economy and correlate to the United States Gross Domestic Product. However, since late 2010, inland petrochemical tank barge utilization has remained relatively stable, in the 90% to 95% range. The United States petrochemical industry continued to see strong production levels for both domestic consumption and exports. Low priced domestic natural gas, a basic feedstock for the United States petrochemical industry, has provided the industry with a competitive advantage against foreign petrochemical producers. As a result, United States petrochemical production has remained stable during 2015, 2014 and 2013, thereby producing increased marine transportation volumes of basic petrochemicals to both domestic consumers and terminals for export destinations. Petrochemical products are used primarily in consumer non-durable and durable goods. Coastal tank barge utilization for the transportation of petrochemicals during 2015 was in the 90% to 95% range.

The demand for black oil, including ship bunkers, varies by type of product transported. Demand for transportation of residual oil, a heavy by-product of refining operations, varies with refinery utilization and usage of feedstocks. During the majority of 2015 and all of 2014 and 2013, inland black oil tank barge utilization remained strong, in the 90% to 95% range, due to strong demand driven by steady refinery production levels from major customers, and the export of diesel fuel and heavy fuel oil. With the decline in the price of crude oil in late 2014 and the low price throughout 2015, movements by tank barge of crude oil and natural gas condensate declined industry-wide. As 2015 progressed, the Company and the industry were generally successful in moving barges from that trade to other markets. The Company continued to transport crude oil and natural gas condensate produced from the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin shale formations in Texas both along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway with inland vessels and in the Gulf of Mexico with coastal equipment, and continued to transport Utica crude oil and natural gas condensate downriver from the Mid-Atlantic to the Gulf Coast. The decline in demand for crude oil and natural gas condensate movements resulted in an occasional decline in utilization in the 2015 fourth quarter to the high-80% level. Coastal black oil tank barge utilization remained in the 90% to 95% range for the majority of 2015 and all of 2014 and 2013, partly attributable to the movement of black oil, specifically residual fuel oil and asphalt, along the United States East and Gulf Coasts. Inland and coastal asphalt shipments are generally seasonal, with higher volumes shipped during April through November, months when weather allows for efficient road construction. Due to the seasonally normal cessation of most operations in Alaska in the 2015 fourth quarter, coastal tank barge utilization was in the high-80% to low-90% range for that quarter. Carbon black feedstock shipments generally track the general economy and are used in the production of automobiles and related parts, and in housing applications. In August 2013, the Company sold its New York Harbor bunkering barges and tugboats, thereby exiting the New York Harbor ship bunker market.

&#160;

Refined petroleum product volumes are driven by United States gasoline and diesel fuel consumption, principally vehicle usage, air travel and weather conditions. Volumes can also relate to gasoline inventory imbalances within the United States. Generally, gasoline and No. 2 oil are exported from the Gulf Coast where refining capacity exceeds demand. The Midwest is a net importer of such products. Volumes were also driven by diesel fuel transported to terminals along the Gulf Coast for export to South America. Ethanol, produced in the Midwest, is moved from the Midwest to Gulf Coast customers; however, during 2013 ethanol volumes declined due to the high price of corn, the major feedstock for United States ethanol production. In the coastal trade, tank barges are frequently used regionally to transport refined petroleum products from a coastal refinery or terminals served by pipelines to the end markets. Many coastal areas have access to refined petroleum products only by using marine transportation as the last link in the distribution chain.

Demand for marine transportation of domestic and imported agricultural fertilizer is directly related to domestic nitrogen-based liquid fertilizer consumption, driven by the production of corn, cotton and wheat. During periods of high natural gas prices, the manufacturing of nitrogen-based liquid fertilizer in the United States is curtailed. During these periods, imported products, which normally involve longer barge trips, replace the domestic products to meet Midwest and south Texas demands. Such products are delivered to the numerous small terminals and distributors throughout the United States farm belt.

Marine Transportation Operations

The marine transportation segment operates a fleet of 898 inland tank barges and 243 inland towboats, as well as 70 coastal tank barges and 73 coastal tugboats. The segment also operates six offshore dry-bulk cargo barges, seven offshore tugboats and one docking tugboat transporting dry-bulk commodities in coastal trade.

Inland Operations. The segment&#8217;s inland operations are conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary, Kirby Inland Marine, LP (&#8220;Kirby Inland Marine&#8221;). Kirby Inland Marine&#8217;s operations consist of the Canal, Linehaul and River fleets, as well as barge fleeting services.

The Canal fleet transports petrochemical feedstocks, processed chemicals, pressurized products, black oil, and refined petroleum products along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, the Mississippi River below Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the Houston Ship Channel. Petrochemical feedstocks and certain pressurized products are transported from one plant to another plant for further processing. Processed chemicals and certain pressurized products are moved to waterfront terminals and chemical plants. Black oil is transported to waterfront terminals and products such as No. 6 fuel oil are transported directly to the end users. Refined petroleum products are transported to waterfront terminals along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway for distribution.

The Linehaul fleet transports petrochemical feedstocks, chemicals, agricultural chemicals and lube oils along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, Mississippi River and the Illinois and Ohio Rivers. Loaded tank barges are staged in the Baton Rouge area from Gulf Coast refineries and petrochemical plants, and are transported from Baton Rouge to waterfront terminals and plants on the Mississippi, Illinois and Ohio Rivers, and along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, on regularly scheduled linehaul tows. Barges are dropped off and picked up going up and down river.

The River fleet transports petrochemical feedstocks, chemicals, refined petroleum products, agricultural chemicals and black oil along the Mississippi River System above Baton Rouge. The River fleet operates unit tows, where a towboat and generally a dedicated group of barges operate on consecutive voyages between loading and discharge points. Petrochemical feedstocks and processed chemicals are transported to waterfront petrochemical and chemical plants, while black oil, refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals are transported to waterfront terminals.

The inland transportation of petrochemical feedstocks, chemicals and pressurized products is generally consistent throughout the year. Transportation of refined petroleum products, certain black oil and agricultural chemicals is generally more seasonal. Movements of black oil, such as asphalt, generally increase in the spring through fall months. Movements of refined petroleum products, such as gasoline blends, generally increase during the summer driving season, while heating oil movements generally increase during the winter months. Movements of agricultural chemicals generally increase during the spring and fall planting seasons.

&#160;

The marine transportation inland operation moves and handles a broad range of sophisticated cargoes. To meet the specific requirements of the cargoes transported, the inland tank barges may be equipped with self-contained heating systems, high-capacity pumps, pressurized tanks, refrigeration units, stainless steel tanks, aluminum tanks or specialty coated tanks. Of the 898 inland tank barges currently operated, 704 are petrochemical and refined petroleum products barges, 120 are black oil barges, 59 are pressure barges, 10 are refrigerated anhydrous ammonia barges and five are specialty barges. Of the 898 inland tank barges, 867 are owned by the Company and 31 are leased.

The fleet of 243 inland towboats ranges from 800 to 5200 horsepower. Of the 243 inland towboats, 164 are owned by the Company and 79 are chartered. Towboats in the 800 to 2100 horsepower classes provide power for barges used by the Canal and Linehaul fleets on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the Houston Ship Channel. Towboats in the 1400 to 3200 horsepower classes provide power for both the River and Linehaul fleets on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the Mississippi River System. Towboats above 3600 horsepower are typically used on the Mississippi River System to move River fleet unit tows and provide Linehaul fleet towing. Based on the capabilities of the individual towboats used in the Mississippi River System, the tows range in size from 10,000 to 30,000 tons.

Marine transportation services for inland movements are conducted under long-term contracts, typically ranging from one to three years, some of which have renewal options, with customers with whom the Company has traditionally had long-standing relationships, as well as under spot contracts. During 2015 and 2014, approximately 80% of the inland marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 20% were spot contract revenues, compared with 75% under term contracts and 25% under spot contracts during 2013.

All of the Company&#8217;s inland tank barges used in the transportation of bulk liquid products are of double hull construction and, where applicable, are capable of controlling vapor emissions during loading and discharging operations in compliance with occupational health and safety regulations and air quality regulations.

The Company is one of the few inland tank barge operators with the ability to offer to its customers&#8217; distribution capabilities throughout the Mississippi River System and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. Such distribution capabilities offer economies of scale resulting from the ability to match tank barges, towboats, products and destinations more efficiently.

Through the Company&#8217;s proprietary vessel management computer system, the fleet of barges and towboats is dispatched from a centralized dispatch at the corporate office. The towboats are equipped with satellite positioning and communication systems that automatically transmit the location of the towboat to the Company&#8217;s customer service department located in its corporate office. Electronic orders are communicated to the vessel personnel with reports of towing activities communicated electronically back to the customer service department. The electronic interface between the customer service department and the vessel personnel enables more effective matching of customer needs to barge capabilities, thereby maximizing utilization of the tank barge and towboat fleet. The Company&#8217;s customers are able to access information concerning the movement of their cargoes, including barge locations, through the Company&#8217;s web site.

Kirby Inland Marine operates the largest commercial tank barge fleeting service (temporary barge storage facilities) in numerous ports, including Houston, Corpus Christi and Freeport, Texas, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana and other locations on the Mississippi River. Included in the fleeting service is a 51% interest and management control of a shifting operation and fleeting service for dry cargo barges on the Houston Ship Channel. Kirby Inland Marine provides service for its own barges, as well as outside customers, transferring barges within the areas noted, as well as fleeting barges.

Kirby Inland Marine also provides shore-based barge tankerman to the Company and third parties. Services to the Company and third parties cover the Gulf Coast, mid-Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio River Valley.

The Company owns a two-thirds interest in Osprey, which transports project cargoes and cargo containers by barge on the United States inland waterway system.

&#160;

Coastal Operations. The segment&#8217;s coastal operations are conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries, Kirby Offshore Marine, LLC (&#8220;Kirby Offshore Marine&#8221;) and Kirby Ocean Transport Company (&#8220;Kirby Ocean Transport&#8221;).

Kirby Offshore Marine provides marine transportation of refined petroleum products, petrochemicals and black oil in coastal regions of the United States. The coastal operations consist of the Atlantic and Pacific Divisions.

The Atlantic Division primarily operates along the eastern seaboard of the United States and along the Gulf Coast. The Atlantic Division vessels call on coastal states from Maine to Texas, servicing refineries, storage terminals and power plants. The Atlantic Division also operates equipment, to a lesser extent, in the Eastern Canadian provinces. The tank barges and tugboats operating in the Atlantic Division are among the largest, with tank barges in the 9,000 to 188,000 barrel capacity range and coastal tugboats in the 1800 to 8000 horsepower range, transporting primarily refined petroleum products, petrochemicals and black oil. 

&#160;

The Pacific Division primarily operates along the Pacific Coast of the United States, servicing refineries and storage terminals from Southern California to Washington State, throughout Alaska, including Dutch Harbor, Cook Inlet and the Alaska River Systems, and from California to Hawaii. The Pacific Division&#8217;s fleet consists of tank barges in the 26,000 to 194,000 barrel capacity range and tugboats in the 2000 to 11000 horsepower range, transporting primarily refined petroleum products.

The Pacific Division also services local petroleum retailers and oil companies distributing refined petroleum products and black oil between the Hawaiian Islands and provides other services to the local maritime community. The Hawaii fleet consists of tank barges in the 53,000 to 86,000 barrel capacity range and tugboats in the 1000 to 5000 horsepower range, transporting refined petroleum products for local and regional customers, black oil to power generation customers and delivering bunker fuel to ships. The Hawaii fleet also provides service docking, standby tug assistance and line handling to vessels using the Single Point Mooring installation at Barbers Point, Oahu, a facility for large tankers to safely load and discharge their cargos through an offshore buoy and submerged pipeline without entering the port.

The coastal transportation of refined petroleum products and black oil is impacted by seasonality, partially dependent on the area of operations. Operations along the West Coast and in Alaska have been subject to more seasonal variations in demand than the operations along the East Coast and Gulf Coast regions. Seasonality generally does not impact the Hawaiian market. Movements of refined petroleum products such as various blends of gasoline are strongest during the summer driving season while heating oil generally increases during the winter months.

The coastal fleet consists of 70 tank barges with 6.0 million barrels of capacity, primarily transporting refined petroleum products, black oil and petrochemicals. Of the 70 coastal tank barges currently operating, 46 are refined petroleum products and petrochemical barges and 24 are black oil barges. The Company owns 62 of the coastal tank barges and eight are leased. The Company operates 73 coastal tugboats ranging from 1000 to 11000 horsepower, of which 67 are owned by the Company and six are chartered.

Coastal marine transportation services are conducted under long-term contracts, primarily one year or longer, some of which have renewal options, for customers with which the Company has traditionally had long-standing relationships, as well as under spot contracts. During 2015, approximately 80% of the coastal marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 20% were spot contract revenues compared with approximately 85% under term contracts and 15% under spot contract during 2014. During 2013, approximately 75% of the coastal marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 25% were spot contract revenues.

Kirby Offshore Marine also operates a fleet of two offshore dry-bulk barge and tugboat units involved in the transportation of sugar and other dry products between Florida and East Coast ports. These vessels primarily operate under contracts of affreightment that are typically one year or less in length.

&#160;

Kirby Ocean Transport owns and operates a fleet of four offshore dry-bulk barges, five offshore tugboats and one docking tugboat. Kirby Ocean Transport operates primarily under term contracts of affreightment, including a contract that expires in 2020 with Progress Energy Florida (&#8220;PEF&#8221;) to transport coal across the Gulf of Mexico to PEF&#8217;s power generation facility at Crystal River, Florida.

Kirby Ocean Transport has a contract with Holcim (US) Inc. (&#8220;Holcim&#8221;) to transport Holcim&#8217;s limestone requirements from a facility adjacent to the PEF facility at Crystal River to Holcim&#8217;s plant in Theodore, Alabama. Holcim&#8217;s contract expires in May 2016. The Holcim contract provides cargo for a portion of the return voyage for the vessels that carry coal to PEF&#8217;s Crystal River facility. Kirby Ocean Transport is also engaged in the transportation of coal, fertilizer, sugar and other bulk cargoes on a short-term basis between domestic ports and occasionally the transportation of grain from domestic ports to ports primarily in the Caribbean Basin.

Contracts and Customers

Marine transportation inland and coastal services are conducted under term contracts, typically ranging from one to three years, some of which have renewal options, for customers with whom the Company has traditionally had long-standing relationships, as well as under spot contracts. The majority of the marine transportation contracts with its customers are for terms of one year. Most have been customers of the Company&#8217;s marine transportation segment for many years and management anticipates continued relationships; however, there is no assurance that any individual contract will be renewed.

A term contract is an agreement with a specific customer to transport cargo from a designated origin to a designated destination at a set rate (affreightment) or at a daily rate (time charter). The rate may or may not escalate during the term of the contract; however, the base rate generally remains constant and contracts often include escalation provisions to recover changes in specific costs such as fuel. Time charters, which insulate the Company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines, represented approximately 55% of the marine transportation&#8217;s inland revenues under term contracts during 2015, 56% of revenue under term contracts during 2014 and 58% of the revenue under term contracts during 2013. A spot contract is an agreement with a customer to move cargo from a specific origin to a designated destination for a rate negotiated at the time the cargo movement takes place. Spot contract rates are at the current &#8220;market&#8221; rate and are subject to market volatility. The Company typically maintains a higher mix of term contracts to spot contracts to provide the Company with a predictable revenue stream while maintaining spot market exposure to take advantage of new business opportunities and existing customers&#8217; peak demands. During 2015 and 2014, approximately 80% of the inland marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 20% were spot contract revenues, compared with 75% under term contracts and 25% under spot contracts during 2013. During 2015, approximately 80% of the coastal marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 20% were spot contract revenues compared with approximately 85% under term contracts and 15% under spot contracts during 2014. During 2013, approximately 75% of the coastal marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and 25% were spot contract revenues. Coastal time charters represented approximately 90% of the marine transportation coastal revenues under term contracts during 2015, 2014 and 2013.

No single customer of the marine transportation segment accounted for 10% of the Company&#8217;s revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Employees

The Company&#8217;s marine transportation segment has approximately 3,250 employees, of which approximately 2,475 are vessel crew members. None of the segment&#8217;s inland operations are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The segment&#8217;s coastal operation includes approximately 950 vessel employees some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain geographic areas. Approximately 400 Kirby Offshore Marine vessel crew members employed in the Atlantic Division are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with the Richmond Terrace Bargaining Unit in effect through December 31, 2016. In addition, approximately 175 Kirby Offshore Marine vessel crew members are represented by the Seafarers International Union (&#8220;SIU&#8221;) under a collective bargaining agreement in effect through April 2016.

&#160;

The principal office of Kirby Inland Marine, Kirby Offshore Marine, Kirby Ocean Transport and Osprey is located in Houston, Texas, in the Company&#8217;s facilities under a lease that expires in December 2025. Kirby Inland Marine&#8217;s operating locations are on the Mississippi River at Baton Rouge and New Orleans, Louisiana, and Greenville, Mississippi, two locations in Houston, Texas, on and near the Houston Ship Channel, one in Miami, Florida, and one in Corpus Christi, Texas. The New Orleans and Houston facilities are owned by the Company, and the Baton Rouge, Greenville, Miami and Corpus Christi facilities are leased. Kirby Offshore Marine&#8217;s operating facilities are located in Staten Island, New York, Seattle, Washington and Honolulu, Hawaii. All of Kirby Offshore Marine&#8217;s operating facilities are leased, including pier and wharf facilities and office and warehouse space.

Governmental Regulations

General. The Company&#8217;s marine transportation operations are subject to regulation by the USCG, federal laws, state laws and certain international conventions.

Most of the Company&#8217;s tank barges are inspected by the USCG and carry certificates of inspection. The Company&#8217;s inland and coastal towing vessels and coastal dry-bulk barges are not currently subject to USCG inspection requirements; however, regulations are currently under development that would subject inland and coastal towing vessels to USCG inspection requirements. Most of the Company&#8217;s coastal tugboats and coastal tank and dry-bulk barges are built to American Bureau of Shipping (&#8220;ABS&#8221;) classification standards and are inspected periodically by ABS to maintain the vessels in class. The crews employed by the Company aboard vessels, including captains, pilots, engineers, tankermen and ordinary seamen, are licensed by the USCG.

The Company is required by various governmental agencies to obtain licenses, certificates and permits for its vessels depending upon such factors as the cargo transported, the waters in which the vessels operate and other factors. The Company is of the opinion that the Company&#8217;s vessels have obtained and can maintain all required licenses, certificates and permits required by such governmental agencies for the foreseeable future.

The Company believes that additional security and environmental related regulations may be imposed on the marine industry in the form of contingency planning requirements. Generally, the Company endorses the anticipated additional regulations and believes it is currently operating to standards at least equal to anticipated additional regulations.

Jones Act. The Jones Act is a federal cabotage law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the United States to vessels built and registered in the United States, manned by United States citizens, and owned and operated by United States citizens. For a corporation to qualify as United States citizens for the purpose of domestic trade, it is to be 75% owned and controlled by United States citizens. The Company monitors citizenship and meets the requirements of the Jones Act for its vessels.

Compliance with United States ownership requirements of the Jones Act is important to the operations of the Company, and the loss of Jones Act status could have a material negative effect on the Company. The Company monitors the citizenship of its employees and stockholders.

User Taxes. Federal legislation requires that inland marine transportation companies pay a user tax based on propulsion fuel used by vessels engaged in trade along the inland waterways that are maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Such user taxes are designed to help defray the costs associated with replacing major components of the inland waterway system, such as locks and dams. A significant portion of the inland waterways on which the Company&#8217;s vessels operate is maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers.

The Company presently pays a federal fuel user tax of 29.1 cents per gallon consisting of a .1 cent per gallon leaking underground storage tank tax and 29 cents per gallon waterways user tax. The waterways user tax rate increased from 20 to 29 cents per gallon of fuel effective April 1, 2015.

Security Requirements. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 requires, among other things, submission to and approval by the USCG of vessel and waterfront facility security plans (&#8220;VSP&#8221; and &#8220;FSP&#8221;, respectively). The Company&#8217;s VSP and FSP have been approved and the Company is operating in compliance with the plans for all of its vessels and facilities that are subject to the requirements.

&#160;

Environmental Regulations

The Company&#8217;s operations are affected by various regulations and legislation enacted for protection of the environment by the United States government, as well as many coastal and inland waterway states.

Water Pollution Regulations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1981 (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;) impose strict prohibitions against the discharge of oil and its derivatives or hazardous substances into the navigable waters of the United States. These acts impose civil and criminal penalties for any prohibited discharges and impose substantial strict liability for cleanup of these discharges and any associated damages. Certain states also have water pollution laws that prohibit discharges into waters that traverse the state or adjoin the state, and impose civil and criminal penalties and liabilities similar in nature to those imposed under federal laws.

The OPA and various state laws of similar intent substantially increased over historic levels the statutory liability of owners and operators of vessels for oil spills, both in terms of limit of liability and scope of damages.

One of the most important requirements under the OPA was that all newly constructed tank barges engaged in the transportation of oil and petroleum in the United States be double hulled, and all existing single hull tank barges be either retrofitted with double hulls or phased out of domestic service by December 31, 2014.

The Company manages its exposure to losses from potential discharges of pollutants through the use of well-maintained and equipped vessels, through safety, training and environmental programs, and through the Company&#8217;s insurance program. There can be no assurance, however, that any new regulations or requirements or any discharge of pollutants by the Company will not have an adverse effect on the Company.

Financial Responsibility Requirement. Commencing with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, vessels over 300 gross tons operating in the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States have been required to maintain evidence of financial ability to satisfy statutory liabilities for oil and hazardous substance water pollution. This evidence is in the form of a Certificate of Financial Responsibility (&#8220;COFR&#8221;) issued by the USCG. The majority of the Company&#8217;s tank barges are subject to this COFR requirement, and the Company has fully complied with this requirement since its inception. The Company does not foresee any current or future difficulty in maintaining the COFR certificates under current rules.

Clean Air Regulations. The Federal Clean Air Act of 1979 requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (&#8220;SIPs&#8221;) designed to reduce atmospheric pollution to levels mandated by this act. Several SIPs provide for the regulation of barge loading and discharging emissions. The implementation of these regulations requires a reduction of hydrocarbon emissions released into the atmosphere during the loading of most petroleum products and the degassing and cleaning of barges for maintenance or change of cargo. These regulations require operators who operate in these states to install vapor control equipment on their barges. The Company expects that future emission regulations will be developed and will apply this same technology to many chemicals that are handled by barge. Most of the Company&#8217;s barges engaged in the transportation of petrochemicals, chemicals and refined petroleum products are already equipped with vapor control systems. Although a risk exists that new regulations could require significant capital expenditures by the Company and otherwise increase the Company&#8217;s costs, the Company believes that, based upon the regulations that have been proposed thus far, no material capital expenditures beyond those currently contemplated by the Company and no material increase in costs are likely to be required.

Contingency Plan Requirement. The OPA and several state statutes of similar intent require the majority of the vessels and terminals operated by the Company to maintain approved oil spill contingency plans as a condition of operation. The Company has approved plans that comply with these requirements. The OPA also requires development of regulations for hazardous substance spill contingency plans. The USCG has not yet promulgated these regulations; however, the Company anticipates that they will not be more difficult to comply with than the oil spill plans.

&#160;

Occupational Health Regulations. The Company&#8217;s inspected vessel operations are primarily regulated by the USCG for occupational health standards. Uninspected vessel operations and the Company&#8217;s shore personnel are subject to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the provisions of the regulations that have been adopted and does not believe that the adoption of any further regulations will impose additional material requirements on the Company. There can be no assurance, however, that claims will not be made against the Company for work related illness or injury, or that the further adoption of health regulations will not adversely affect the Company.

Insurance. The Company&#8217;s marine transportation operations are subject to the hazards associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk cargo in a marine environment. These hazards include the risk of loss of or damage to the Company&#8217;s vessels, damage to third parties as a result of collision, fire or explosion, loss or contamination of cargo, personal injury of employees and third parties, and pollution and other environmental damages. The Company maintains insurance coverage against these hazards. Risk of loss of or damage to the Company&#8217;s vessels is insured through hull insurance currently insuring approximately $3.4 billion in hull values. Liabilities such as collision, cargo, environmental, personal injury and general liability are insured up to $1.3 billion per occurrence.

Environmental Protection. The Company has a number of programs that were implemented to further its commitment to environmental responsibility in its operations. In addition to internal environmental audits, one such program is environmental audits of barge cleaning vendors principally directed at management of cargo residues and barge cleaning wastes. Others are the participation by the Company in the American Waterways Operators Responsible Carrier program and the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care program, both of which are oriented towards continuously reducing the barge industry&#8217;s and chemical and petroleum industries&#8217; impact on the environment, including the distribution services area.

Safety. The Company manages its exposure to the hazards associated with its business through safety, training and preventive maintenance efforts. The Company places considerable emphasis on safety through a program oriented toward extensive monitoring of safety performance for the purpose of identifying trends and initiating corrective action, and for the purpose of rewarding personnel achieving superior safety performance. The Company believes that its safety performance consistently places it among the industry leaders as evidenced by what it believes are lower injury frequency and pollution incident levels than many of its competitors.

Training. The Company believes that among the major elements of a successful and productive work force are effective training programs. The Company also believes that training in the proper performance of a job enhances both the safety and quality of the service provided. New technology, regulatory compliance, personnel safety, quality and environmental concerns create additional demands for training. The Company has developed and instituted effective training programs.

Centralized training is provided through the Operations Personnel and Training Department, which is charged with developing, conducting and maintaining training programs for the benefit of all of the Company&#8217;s operating entities. It is also responsible for ensuring that training programs are both consistent and effective. The Company&#8217;s training facility includes state-of-the-art equipment and instruction aids, including a full bridge wheelhouse simulator, a working towboat, two tank barges and a tank barge simulator for tankermen training. During 2015, approximately 2,200 certificates were issued for the completion of courses at the training facility, of which 1,000 were USCG approved classes and the balance were employee development and Company required classes, including Leadership and Defensive Driving.

Quality. Kirby Inland Marine has made a substantial commitment to the implementation, maintenance and improvement of Quality Assurance Systems in compliance with the International Quality Standard, ISO 9001. Kirby Offshore Marine is certified under ABS ISM standards. These Quality Assurance Systems and certification have enabled both shore and vessel personnel to effectively manage the changes which occur in the working environment, as well as enhancing the Company&#8217;s safety and environmental performance.

Marine Operations

The Company is engaged in the overhaul and repair of medium-speed and high-speed diesel engines and reduction gears, line boring, block welding services and related parts sales for customers in the marine industry, which represented 29% of the segment&#8217;s 2015 revenues. Medium-speed diesel engines have an engine speed of 400 to 1000 revolutions per minute (&#8220;RPM&#8221;) with a horsepower range of 800 to 32000. High-speed diesel engines have an engine speed of over 1000 RPM and a horsepower range of 50 to 8375. The Company services medium-speed and high-speed diesel engines utilized in the inland and offshore barge industries. It also services marine equipment and offshore drilling equipment used in the offshore petroleum exploration and oil service industry, marine equipment used in the offshore commercial fishing industry and vessels owned by the United States government.

The Company has marine operations throughout the United States providing in-house and in-field repair capabilities and related parts sales. The Company&#8217;s emphasis is on service to its customers, and it sends its crews from any of its locations to service customers&#8217; equipment anywhere in the world. The medium-speed operations are located in Houma, Louisiana, Chesapeake, Virginia, Paducah, Kentucky, Seattle, Washington and Tampa, Florida. The operations based in Chesapeake, Virginia and Tampa, Florida are authorized distributors for 17 eastern states for Electro-Motive Diesel, Inc. (&#8220;EMD&#8221;). The marine operations based in Houma, Louisiana, Paducah, Kentucky and Seattle, Washington are nonexclusive contract service centers for EMD providing service and related parts sales. The Company is also a distributor and representative for certain Alfa Laval products in the Midwest and on the East Coast, Gulf Coast, and West Coast. All of the marine locations are authorized distributors for Falk Corporation reduction gears and Oil States Industries, Inc. clutches. The Chesapeake, Virginia operation concentrates on East Coast inland and offshore dry-bulk, tank barge and harbor docking operators, the USCG and United States Navy (&#8220;Navy&#8221;). The Houma, Louisiana operation concentrates on the inland and offshore barge and oil services industries. The Tampa, Florida operation concentrates on Gulf of Mexico offshore dry-bulk, tank barge and harbor docking operators. The Paducah, Kentucky operation concentrates on the inland river towboat and barge operators and the Great Lakes carriers. The Seattle, Washington operation concentrates on the offshore commercial fishing industry, the tugboat and barge industry, the USCG and Navy, and other customers in Alaska, Hawaii and the Pacific Rim.

&#160;

The high-speed operations are located in Houma, Baton Rouge, Belle Chasse and New Iberia, Louisiana, Paducah, Kentucky, Mobile, Alabama, Houston, Texas and Thorofare, New Jersey.

Marine Customers

The Company&#8217;s major marine customers include inland and offshore barge operators, oil service companies, offshore fishing companies, other marine transportation entities, and the USCG and Navy.

Since the marine business is linked to the relative health of the diesel power tugboat and towboat industry, the offshore supply boat industry, the oil and gas drilling industry, the military and the offshore commercial fishing industry, there is no assurance that its present gross revenues can be maintained in the future. The results of the diesel engine services industry are largely tied to the industries it serves and, therefore, are influenced by the cycles of such industries.

Marine Competitive Conditions

The Company&#8217;s primary competitors are independent diesel engine services companies and other factory-authorized distributors, authorized service centers and authorized marine dealers. Certain operators of diesel powered marine equipment also elect to maintain in-house service capabilities. While price is a major determinant in the competitive process, reputation, consistent quality, expeditious service, experienced personnel, access to parts inventories and market presence are also significant factors. A substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s business is obtained by competitive bids. However, the Company has entered into preferential service agreements with certain operators of diesel powered marine equipment, providing such operators with one source of support and service for all of their requirements at pre-negotiated prices.

The Company is one of a limited number of authorized resellers of EMD, Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit Diesel and John Deere parts. The Company is also the only marine distributor for Falk reduction gears throughout the United States.

The Company has long standing relationships with most of its customers.

Since the land-based business is linked to the oilfield services industry and oil and gas operators and producers, there is no assurance that its present gross revenues can be maintained in the future. The results of the land-based diesel engine services industry are largely tied to the industries it serves and, therefore, are influenced by the cycles of such industries.

Land-Based Competitive Conditions

The Company&#8217;s primary competitors are other oilfield equipment manufacturers and service companies. While price is a major determinant in the competitive process, equipment availability, reputation, consistent quality, expeditious service, experienced personnel, access to parts inventories and market presence are also significant factors. A substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s business is obtained by competitive bids.
