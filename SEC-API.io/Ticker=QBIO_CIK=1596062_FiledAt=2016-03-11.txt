 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

General information 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 22, 2013 under the name ISMO Technology Solutions and attempted to establish a base of operation in the information technology sector and provide IT hardware, software and support solutions to businesses and households. On January 13, 2014, we filed a registration statement on form S-1 registering 6,250,000 shares of common stock, which was declared effective on March 25, 2014. However, we did not pursue our business plan to any great extent due to the deteriorating health of the major shareholder and CEO, Mr. Enrique Navas. 

On August 5, 2015, we recorded a stock split effectuated in the form a stock dividend. The stock dividend was paid at a rate of 1.5 &#8220;new&#8221; shares for every one issued and outstanding share held. All common share amounts and per share amounts as referred throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the stock split. 

On April 21, 2015, we issued 2,500,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Denis Corin pursuant to a consulting agreement and Mr. Corin also agreed to join the Board of Directors. 

On June 1, 2015, our shareholders elected Mr. William Rosenstadt to the Board of Directors and appointed him as general counsel. In exchange for such services for a one-year term, we agreed to pay Mr. Rosenstadt 375,000 shares of our common stock. We engaged the law firm at which Mr. Rosenstadt is a partner to provide us with legal services. We paid for these services for the first six months through the issuance to such law firm of 500,000 shares of our common stock and, more recently, 250,000 five-year warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at a price of $4.15 per share. 

Also on June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors determined it was in the best interest of the Company to establish a base of operations in the biomedical industry. As a result, the Board of Directors approved a change in the Company&#8217;s name from &#8220;ISMO Tech Solutions, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Q BioMed Inc.&#8221; Q BioMed Inc. is now establishing its business as a biomedical acceleration and development company focused on licensing, acquiring and providing strategic resources to life sciences and healthcare companies. Q BioMed intends to mitigate risk by acquiring multiple assets over time and across a broad spectrum of healthcare related products, companies and sectors. These assets will be developed to provide returns via organic growth, out-licensing, sale or spin-out into new public companies. 

On July 23, 2015, our founder and CEO, Mr. Enrique Navas, resigned from his position a director of our company and any positions that he held as an officer of the Company. This resignation did not result from any dispute or disagreement with us, our independent accountants, our counsel or our operations, policies and practices. Mr. Navas agreed to return 3,750,000 shares of common stock owned by him to the treasury. 

On October 27, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to increase the number of shares of common stock that we are authorized to issue from 100,000,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares. The Certificate of Amendment affected no provisions of our Articles of Incorporation other than the number of common stock that were are authorized to issue, and we are still authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. 

We plan to incorporate a Cayman Islands subsidiary in 2016 which will hold certain intellectual property and assets that we acquire or develop in furtherance of our business plan. 

Our Drug Discovery Approach 

&#160; 

Our mission is to: (i) license and acquire innovative life sciences assets from academia or small private companies and provide the strategic capital, including intellectual, business development and financial advice to accelerate their product development timeline; (ii) commercialize innovative drug candidates with novel mechanisms of action using our ability to raise capital and bring experienced advisors to assist in developing such commercial plan; (iii) acquire FDA approved drugs and medical devices with limited current and commercial activity with the goal of developing a larger commercial market. 

Research and Development Pipeline 

On October 29, 2015, we entered into a Patent and Technology License and Purchase Option Agreement (&#8220;Exclusive License&#8221;) with Mannin Research Inc. (&#8220;Mannin&#8221;) whereby we were granted a worldwide, exclusive, license on, and option to, acquire certain Mannin intellectual property (&#8220;Mannin IP&#8221;) within the four-year term of the Exclusive License. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Mannin IP is initially focused on developing a first-in-class eye drop treatment for glaucoma. The technology platform may be expanded in scope beyond ophthalmological uses and may include cystic kidney disease and others. The initial cost to acquire the Exclusive License was $50,000 and the issuance of 200,000 shares of our common stock subject to an 18-month restriction from trading and subsequent leak-out conditions. Upon Mannin completing a successful phase 1 proof of concept trial in glaucoma, we will be obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock to Mannin, also subject to leak-out conditions. We believe this milestone could occur in the fourth quarter of 2018. 

Pursuant to the Exclusive License, we may purchase the Mannin IP within the next four years in exchange for: (i) investing a minimum of $4,000,000 into the development of the Mannin IP and (ii) possibly issuing Mannin additional shares of our common stock based on meeting pre-determined valuation and market conditions. Subsequent to November 30, 2015, we have paid the $50,000 initial cash requirement and an additional payment of $150,000 to fund the costs of development of the drop treatment for glaucoma. 

In the event that: (i) we do not exercise the option to purchase the Mannin IP; (ii) we fail to invest the $4,000,000 within four years from the date of the Exclusive License; or (iii) we fail to make a diligent, good faith and commercially reasonable effort to progress the Mannin IP, all Mannin IP shall revert back to Mannin and we shall be granted the right to collect twice the monies invested through that date of reversion by way of a royalty along with other consideration which may be perpetual 

Our Strategy 

Our aim is to be a leading biotechnology acceleration and development company dedicated to acquiring and providing strategic resources to pre-clinical, clinical stage and near revenue healthcare companies and products. We have identified several targets that could provide a substantial pipeline of innovative and high value assets. We will aim to maximize risk-adjusted returns by focusing on multiple assets throughout the discovery and development cycle. We expect to benefit from early positioning in illiquid and/or unknown private assets with multiple potential products in their development cycle and capitalize on valuation growth as they move forward in their development. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Strategically collaborate or in- and out-license select programs. 

We intend to seek to collaborate or in- and out-license certain potentially therapeutic candidate products to biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies for preclinical and clinical development and commercialization. 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Highly leverage external talent and resources. 

We plan to maintain and further build our team which is skilled in evaluating technologies for development and product development towards commercialization. By partnering with industry specific experts, we are able to identify undervalued assets that we can fund and assist in enhancing inherent value. We plan to continue to rely on the extensive experience of our management team to execute on our objectives. 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Evaluate commercialization strategies on a product-by-product basis in order to maximize the value of our product candidates or future potential products. 

As we move our drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we will evaluate several options for each drug candidate&#8217;s commercialization strategy. These options include building our own internal sales force; entering into a joint marketing partnership with another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing any product that we develop by ourselves or jointly with another party, whereby another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets such product and pays us a royalty on sales. Our decision will be made separately for each product and will be based on a number of factors including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. It is too early for us to know which of these options we will pursue for our drug candidates, assuming their successful development. 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Acquire commercially or near-commercially ready products and build out the current market for such. 

In addition to acquiring pre-clinical products, in assembling a diversified portfolio of healthcare assets, we plan on acquiring assets that are either FDA approved or are reasonably expected to be FDA approved within 12 months of our acquiring them. We anticipate hiring a contract sales organization to assume the bulk of the sales and distribution efforts related to any such product. 

Patents and Intellectual Property Rights 

If products we acquired do not have adequate intellectual protection, we will take the necessary steps to protect our proprietary therapeutic product candidate assets and associated technologies that are important to our business consisting of seeking and maintaining domestic and international patents. These may cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business. Our competitive position depends on our ability to obtain patents on our technologies and our potential products, to defend our patents, to protect our trade secrets and to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets of others. We seek licenses from others as appropriate to enhance or maintain our competitive position. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In connection with Man-01, we hold a license to all intellectual property related thereto. A U.S. patent was filed in 2015 as it related to Man-01, and we plan to file international patent applications in 2016. 

&#160; 

Reports to Security Holders 

We are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act, and we intend to furnish our shareholders&#8217; annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. We will continue to file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the SEC in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements. We may also file additional documents with the SEC if they become necessary in the course of our operations. 

The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov. 

Employees 

As of March 11, 2016, we had no employees and four management consultants.
