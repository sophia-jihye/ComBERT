Background 

Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;Atlantic Capital,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Georgia corporation organized in 2006 and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is the parent of Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Bank operates as a full service, locally-managed commercial bank with 25 offices located primarily in the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, Georgia and Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tennessee. 

We provide a competitive array of credit, treasury management, and deposit products and services to emerging growth businesses, middle market corporations, commercial real estate developers and investors, and private clients. Our wealth management division offers financial planning, trust administration, investment management and estate planning services. We also provide selected capital markets, mortgage banking, and electronic banking services to our corporate, business, and individual clients. 

On October 31, 2015, Atlantic Capital completed its acquisition of First Security and its subsidiary FSGBank, N.A. (&#8220;FSGBank&#8221;). In connection with the acquisition, Atlantic Capital&#8217;s subsidiary Atlantic Capital Bank, a Georgia chartered commercial bank merged with and into FSGBank, N.A, which subsequently changed its name to Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A. (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). In connection with the acquisition, Atlantic Capital issued approximately 8,790,193 shares of common stock as partial consideration to former shareholders of First Security, with the remaining consideration consisting of approximately $47.1 million in cash. 

In conjunction with the merger, Atlantic Capital also completed a $25.0 million private placement of Atlantic Capital common stock, at $12.60 per share. Atlantic Capital used a portion of the proceeds from this private placement and a $50.0 million private placement of subordinated notes completed on September 28, 2015, to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration. Atlantic Capital acquired approximately $970 million of loans and loans held for sale, and assumed approximately $801 million of deposits with the merger. 

On December 17, 2015, Atlantic Capital announced the sale of seven legacy First Security branches in Eastern Tennessee. This office divestiture includes the sale of approximately $213 million in deposits, $35 million in loans and $7.0 million in other assets. Subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, the branch sales are expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2016. 

Our Products and Services 

We provide credit, treasury management, and depository services to emerging growth businesses, middle market corporations, commercial real estate developers and investors, and private clients through corporate and business banking, commercial real estate finance, specialty corporate financial services, and private banking teams. 

Corporate and Business Banking 

We focus our corporate and business banking activities on the complex needs of emerging growth businesses and middle market companies. We address the needs of our corporate and business banking clients with experienced bankers and advanced treasury management services technology. We offer a full suite of corporate and business banking credit products to fund a client&#8217;s strategic growth, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and strategic corporate finance activities. Our solutions include working capital and equipment loans, loans supported by owner-occupied real estate and strategic corporate financing funded through revolving lines of credit, term loans and letters of credit. 

The terms of our corporate and business banking loans vary by purpose and by the underlying collateral, if any. The vast majority of these loans are secured by assets of the borrower; however, we periodically make unsecured loans to our most credit worthy clients when circumstances support such activity. Loans to support working capital typically have terms not exceeding one year and are usually fully-secured by accounts receivable and inventory, as well as by personal guarantees of the principals or owners of the business. For loans secured by accounts receivable or inventory, the principal balance is repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash. For loans secured with other types of collateral, the principal balance generally amortizes over the term of the loan. The quality of the corporate borrower&#8217;s management and its ability to both properly evaluate and respond to changes affecting its business operations and operating environment are significant factors we evaluate with respect to a commercial borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. 

Private Banking 

Our private banking business team focuses on serving the banking needs of professional firms throughout our regional markets, the principals of our corporate and commercial real estate clients, and other private clients. We offer personal credit products, an array of checking and savings products and online and mobile banking services. 

Our private banking credit products include loans to individuals for personal and investment purposes, such as secured installment and term loans and home equity lines of credit. Repayment of these loans is often primarily dependent upon the borrower&#8217;s financial profile and is more likely to be adversely affected by personal hardships as compared to other types of loans. Our loan officers review a borrower&#8217;s credit and debt history, past income levels and cash flow and determine the impact of all these factors on the ability of the borrower to make future payments. Home equity lines of credit are underwritten based upon the borrower&#8217;s credit profile and perceived ability to repay the entirety of the obligation. 

Commercial Real Estate Finance 

Our commercial real estate team is highly focused on a select group of clients characterized by superior financial resources and long industry experience. We believe our focus on &#8220;top-tier&#8221; clients provides us with larger loan opportunities which enables us to achieve desired commercial real estate loan production with a relatively smaller team of experienced bankers. 

Our primary commercial real estate loan types include secured construction loans, secured mini-permanent loans and, less frequently, secured or unsecured lines of credit. A large majority of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is secured by a first mortgage security interest in the property financed. We occasionally extend unsecured credit to public real estate investment trusts and to certain other commercial real estate clients, which we believe to have exceptional credit quality. We focus almost exclusively on providing loans for our core commercial real estate property types: multifamily (primarily for-rent) housing, office, industrial and retail properties. 

In keeping with our &#8220;top-tier&#8221; client strategy, virtually all of our commercial real estate customers are based in our primary market areas. Accordingly, the largest proportion of our commercial real estate collateral is located in these markets. We have occasionally extended credit to select clients in markets outside our primary markets and expect to continue to do this in certain circumstances. 

The majority of our total commercial real estate loans have been used to finance stabilized income producing assets of our borrowers. We have also extended a smaller percentage of loans for construction and development purposes and lines of credit. We seek to actively manage and balance our commercial real estate loan portfolio across various property types to assure appropriate diversification and to manage our exposure to market conditions. We have arranged and participated in syndicated commercial real estate loans to diversify and mitigate our loan concentration risk and to support our loan growth goals, and we may continue both in the future. Overall, our goal is to maintain frequent contact with our borrowers and, through that contact, build a deep understanding of each client&#8217;s business strategy, property status and overall financial strength and flexibility. 

Specialty Corporate Financial Services 

Our specialty corporate financial services team provides treasury management services, payments industry banking, financial institutions banking, capital markets services, and specialty commercial lending to emerging growth businesses, middle market corporations, payroll companies, and other banks on a selected basis in the southeastern United States and nationally. 

Corporate treasury management services are designed to facilitate domestic and international collection and disbursement of client funds with real time online execution and reporting capabilities. We believe our services are competitive with those offered by large regional and national competitors. Our corporate treasury management professionals are highly experienced and provide expert advice to our clients. 

We offer electronic payments services to payroll companies and other high transaction volume clients through the FedWire and Automated Clearing House (ACH) systems. These services generate substantial fee income and demand deposit balances for us. We use sophisticated systems capabilities and the expertise of our people to process high transaction volumes and manage and monitor risks associated with this activity. 

Other financial institutions throughout the southeastern United States maintain money market deposit accounts with us to earn a higher return than that available on other short term investment or on balances at the Federal Reserve Bank. Our strong capitalization levels and superior credit quality have helped us attract large deposit amounts from other banks. 

We provide targeted capital markets services, principally interest rate protection and foreign exchange, to our business and corporate clients, and loan sales and syndications to our bank clients. Spot and forward foreign exchange transactions are provided through third parties on a private label basis. Interest rate swaps are offered to our clients to hedge interest rate exposure on loans and are fully hedged on our books with mirror transactions with other financial institutions. 

Specialty commercial loans consist of Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) loans, franchise finance programs, and commercial mortgage loans on single credit tenant properties (the &#8220;TriNet division&#8221;). We offer these loans to small businesses, franchisees, and real estate investors across a wide range of industries in the southeast and nationally with a dedicated team of bankers with expertise in these specialized forms of lending. 

Residential Mortgage 

Our residential mortgage loan department primarily originates loans for sale into the secondary market. We generally do not retain long-term, fixed rate residential real estate loans in our portfolio due to interest rate and collateral risks and low levels of profitability. The limited amount of residential loans to individuals that are retained in our loan portfolio primarily consist of first liens on 1-4 family residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit. 

Trust &#38; Wealth Management 

We offer wealth management services including private client services, financial planning, trust administration, investment management, brokerage and estate planning services. Our trust and wealth management business is branded as Southeastern Trust Company and serves clients throughout the southeastern United States. 

Competition and Market Area 

We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than we do. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and Internet banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries. 

The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. 

As of June 30, 2015, there were approximately 81 banks and thrifts operating in metropolitan Atlanta, 27 in the Chattanooga market and 50 in the Knoxville market. We believe the large national, super-regional and regional banks are our primary competitors. However, we believe that large banks often lack the consistency of decision-making authority and local focus necessary to provide superior service to our target markets. Conversely, smaller community banks typically lack the sophisticated products, capital and management experience to provide full service to our target markets. Through our local ownership, experienced management team and broad line of products and services, we believe we efficiently provide clients with loan, deposit and other financial products tailored to fit their specific needs. 

We do not believe we are dependent on any one or any several customers or types of business whose loss would have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our corporate and business banking clients represent a variety of industry sectors, including industrial and manufacturing, financial services, business services, not-for-profit, consumer service and retail. We intend to continue diversifying our client base across industries as a way to diversify our loan portfolio risk, gain market presence and leverage the industry experience of our corporate and business banking team. We also intend to further expand our corporate and business banking client base by cross-selling our services to clients of our deposit and treasury services and by soliciting relationships with new clients and capitalizing on prospective clients eager to explore new banking relationships. Moreover, we seek to become the primary banking relationship for our clients by remaining intensely focused on serving their needs. To achieve this position, we focus on providing significant expertise and capability to execute transactions, a deep understanding of our client&#8217;s business and banking needs and attentive care from senior and experienced bankers that a client might not obtain from larger banking institutions. 

Our Business Strategy 

Our objective is to build a premier regional corporate, business, and private bank operating in key metropolitan markets across the southeastern United States through a combination of strong growth in our existing businesses and markets and strategic expansion to new markets. In particular, we focus on client segments where we believe the expertise and experience of our bankers, competitive and sophisticated service capabilities, and high touch service delivery can differentiate us from our competitors. The essence of our business strategy is to build enduring and growing relationships with carefully selected corporate, business, and individual clients by providing tailored financial solutions and services to them from a broad range of credit, treasury management and depository, and trust and wealth management capabilities. We believe a growing number of client relationships with income streams from multiple services provided will result, over time, in reliable and consistent earnings and returns on our shareholders&#8217; capital. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We enjoy a number of important competitive strengths that we believe will drive our success and differentiate us from our competitors. 

Market Focus 

We believe that emerging growth businesses, middle market companies, commercial real estate developers, their principals, investors and other private clients are often unable to have all of their banking needs met by large financial institutions or small community banks. We are designed to provide the consistency of attention, local leadership and necessary decision-making authority that large financial institutions often lack. We also offer the sophisticated products, capital and expertise required by these clients that are typically absent from small community banks. Every aspect of Atlantic Capital is focused on serving our target clients&#8217; unique and complex needs. 

Experienced Bankers 

Our bankers focus on serving corporate, business, and private clients in our primary market areas. We have attracted seasoned senior bankers who have enjoyed successful careers at one or more of our large national competitors and who understand and believe in our strategy and target market focus. Our bankers offer sophisticated advice, a deep knowledge of the client&#8217;s business and of local markets as well as personalized client service. We believe that our banking team&#8217;s highly-tailored focus and significant personal network, along with their substantial decision-making authority and our streamlined credit process, enable us to offer services and products to our target market more effectively and efficiently than our competitors. 

Flexible, Client-Focused Technology 

Our operating platform and service capabilities were developed from a broad array of market-leading third-party technologies built specifically to serve the banking needs of our target markets. Our technology solutions, in particular, our treasury services, are designed to improve a client&#8217;s &#8220;backroom&#8221; efficiency by allowing the client to process a variety of banking transactions utilizing our comprehensive online options. We use technology to enable high touch human and electronic delivery of banking solutions and services to our clients. 

Credit Culture Designed to Yield Superior Asset Quality 

We believe that maintaining superior asset quality allows us to remain focused on acquiring new clients and providing attentive service to current clients and helps ensure consistent earnings performance. Since our inception in 2006, we have maintained sound credit quality despite a global financial crisis, a severe recession, and a modest economic expansion. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 361individuals (359 of whom were full-time equivalent employees). Each of our employees is also an employee of the Bank. We are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with employees to be good. 

Segment Reporting 

We consider our operations to be a single business segment as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting . We have determined that our lending divisions meet the aggregation criteria of ASC 280 as the products and services, nature of the production processes, types of customers, methods used to distribute products and services and the regulatory environment are sufficiently similar to aggregate their results. 

Supervision and Regulation 

Bank holding companies and national banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules and regulations that affect or will affect the Company and the Bank. This summary is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to their respective businesses. Supervision, regulation and examination of the Company and the Bank by regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders of the Company. The Company cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which the business of the Company and the Bank may be affected by a statute or regulation. The discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations may have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s business and prospects. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation and Structure &#32; 

As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;) and to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. The Bank is chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and thus is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. 

The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: 

&#8226; 

it may acquire substantially all of the assets of any other bank holding company, or direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any other bank holding company if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of the other bank holding company; 

&#8226; 

it may acquire substantially all of the assets of any other bank, or direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if, after the acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of the bank; 

&#8226; 

it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank; or 

&#8226; 

it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. 

The BHCA further provides that the Federal Reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or that would substantially lessen competition in the banking business, unless the public interest in meeting the needs of the communities to be served outweighs the anti-competitive effects. The Federal Reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial 

resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks involved and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served. Consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and consideration of convenience and needs issues, which focuses, in part, on the performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;). 

Subject to various exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with related regulations, require Federal Reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company. Control is also presumed to exist, although rebuttable, if a person or company acquires 10% or more, but less than 25%, of any class of voting securities and either: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the bank holding company has registered securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; or 

&#8226; 

no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. 

&#160; 

Our common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. The regulations provide a procedure for challenging rebuttable presumptions of control. 

The BHCA generally prohibits a bank holding company from engaging in, or acquiring 5% or more of the voting stock of a company engaged in, activities other than banking; managing or controlling banks or other permissible subsidiaries and performing servicing activities for subsidiaries; and engaging in any activities other than activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by order or regulation are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident included thereto under the BHCA. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve considers whether performing the activity can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or control of any subsidiary when the continuation of the activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company. 

Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, bank holding companies may elect to become &#8220;financial holding companies&#8221; that may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits a single financial services organization to offer a more complete array of financial products and services than historically was permitted. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company may file an election with the Federal Reserve to be treated as a financial holding company and engage in an expanded list of financial activities. The election must be accompanied by a certification that the Company&#8217;s insured depository institution subsidiary is &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed.&#8221; Additionally, the CRA rating of each subsidiary bank must be satisfactory or better. The Company has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company. 

We are required to act as a source of financial strength for the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company might not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans made by the Company to the Bank will be repaid only after the Bank&#8217;s deposits and various other obligations are repaid in full. 

Bank Merger Act &#32; 

Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, commonly known as the &#8220;Bank Merger Act,&#8221; requires the prior written approval of the OCC before any bank may (i) merge or consolidate with, (ii) purchase or otherwise acquire the assets of, or (iii) assume the deposit liabilities of, another bank if the resulting institution is to be a national bank. 

The Bank Merger Act prohibits the OCC from approving any proposed merger transaction that would result in a monopoly or would further a combination or conspiracy to monopolize or to attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. Similarly, the Bank Merger Act prohibits the OCC from approving a proposed merger transaction whose effect in any section of the country may be to lessen competition substantially, or to tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade. An exception may be made in the case of a merger transaction whose effect would be to substantially lessen competition, tend to create a monopoly, or otherwise restrain trade, if the OCC finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the probable effect of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served. 

In every proposed merger transaction, the OCC must also consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, and the effectiveness of each insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combating money-laundering activities, including in overseas branches. 

Capital Adequacy 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved a final rule (&#8220;final rule&#8221;) that changes the regulatory capital framework for all banking organizations and revises the prompt corrective action categories to incorporate the revised regulatory capital standards. The final rule implements for U.S. banks the Basel III regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The final rule strengthens areas of weakness identified in the Basel I capital rules by: (1) enhancing the quantity and quality of regulatory capital in the banking system; (2) better reflecting the risk of certain on and off-balance sheet exposures in the measurement of risk-weighted assets; and (3) building additional capital capacity into the banking system to absorb losses in times of future market and economic stress. Subject to certain transition provisions, banking organizations with $250 billion or less in total assets were required to comply with the new requirements beginning January 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

The final rule establishes new prompt corrective action requirements for all banks and includes a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital measure. The risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements under the final rule are set forth in the table that follows.

The capital conservation buffer must be maintained in order for a banking organization to avoid being subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. 

The final rule includes comprehensive guidance with respect to the measurement of risk-weighted assets. For residential mortgages, Basel III retains the risk-weights contained in the current capital rules which assign a risk-weight of 50% to most first-lien exposures and 100% to other residential mortgage exposures. The final rule would increase the risk-weights associated with certain on-balance sheet assets, such as high volatility commercial real estate loans, as defined, and loans that are more than 90 days past due or in nonaccrual status. Capital requirements would also increase for certain off-balance sheet exposures including, for example, loan commitments with an original maturity of one year or less. 

Under the final rule, certain banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, are permitted to make a one-time election to continue the current treatment of excluding from regulatory capital most accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) components, including amounts relating to unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities and amounts attributable to defined benefit post-retirement plans. Institutions that elect to exclude most AOCI components from regulatory capital under Basel III will be able to avoid volatility that would otherwise be caused by things such as the impact of fluctuations in interest 

rates on the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities. The Company and the Bank elected to exclude AOCI components from regulatory capital under Basel III. 

Liquidity &#160; &#32; 

In December 2010, the Basel Committee published &#8220;Basel III: International Framework for Liquidity Risk Measurement, Standards and Monitoring&#8221; and in January 2013 published a revised liquidity coverage ratio (collectively referred to as the &#8220;Liquidity Standard&#8221;). The Liquidity Standard includes: (1) a liquidity coverage ratio to ensure that sufficient high quality liquid resources are available in case of a liquidity crisis; (2) a net stable funding ratio to promote liquidity resiliency over longer time horizons by creating incentives for banks to fund their activities with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis; and (3) additional liquidity monitoring metrics focused on maturity mismatch, concentration of funding and available unencumbered assets. The Liquidity Standard would be phased-in through 2019. On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies issued a final liquidity rule that establishes for the first time a standardized minimum liquidity requirement. The final rule applies to large and internationally active banking organizations and is not applicable to the Bank. The U.S. banking agencies have not adopted or proposed rules to implement a quantitative liquidity requirement for banks such as the Bank with less than $50 billion in total assets, and it is uncertain whether such a requirement will be established. 

Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on taking brokered deposits and certain other restrictions on its business. As described below, the FDIC can impose substantial additional restrictions upon FDIC-insured depository institutions that fail to meet applicable capital requirements as set forth above. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDI Act&#8221;) requires the federal regulatory agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; if a depository institution does not meet minimum capital requirements as set forth above. Generally, a receiver or conservator for a bank that is &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; must be appointed within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed within 45 days of the date a bank is deemed to have received notice that it is &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Any holding company for a bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the bank&#8217;s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by regulator, or (ii) the amount necessary to restore the bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the bank is notified that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for specified time periods. Additional measures with respect to undercapitalized institutions include a prohibition on capital distributions, growth limits and restrictions on activities. 

The federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted regulations establishing relevant capital measures and relevant capital levels applicable to FDIC-insured banks. The relevant capital measures are the Total Risk-Based Capital ratio, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio and the leverage ratio. Under the regulations, a FDIC-insured bank will be: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 6.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by the appropriate regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; 

&#8226; 

&#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 6% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4% or greater and is not &#8220;well capitalized;&#8221; 

&#8226; 

&#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 8%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6%, a Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4% and is not &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

&#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 4%, a Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 3% or a leverage ratio of less than 3% and is not &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;; and 

&#8226; 

&#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if its tangible equity is equal to or less than 2% of average quarterly tangible assets. 

An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had capital levels that qualify as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under such regulations. 

The FDI Act generally prohibits an FDIC-insured bank from making a capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the bank would thereafter be &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; &#8220;Undercapitalized&#8221; banks are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. The federal regulators may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the bank&#8217;s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable to regulators, the bank&#8217;s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of: (i) an amount equal to 5% of the bank&#8217;s total assets at the time it became &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;; and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; 

&#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; insured banks may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; requirements to reduce total assets and the cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#8220;Critically undercapitalized&#8221; institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. A bank that is not &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; is also subject to certain limitations relating to brokered deposits. 

For further detail on capital and capital ratios see discussion under &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; section, &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources,&#8221; contained in Item 7. 

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

The FDIC, through the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;), insures the deposits of the Bank up to prescribed limits for each depositor, (currently, $250,000 per depositor). The assessment paid by each DIF member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other factors. Specifically, the assessment rate is based on the institution&#8217;s capitalization risk category and supervisory subgroup category. An institution&#8217;s capitalization risk category is based on the FDIC&#8217;s determination of whether the institution is well capitalized, adequately capitalized or less than adequately capitalized. The Bank&#8217;s insurance assessments during 2015 and 2014 were $789,000 and $643,000, respectively. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC also revised the deposit insurance assessment system, effective April 1, 2011, to base assessments on the average total consolidated assets of insured depository institutions during the assessment period, less the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period as opposed to solely bank deposits at an institution. This base assessment change necessitated that the FDIC adjust the assessment rates to ensure that the revenue collected under the new assessment system will approximately equal that under the existing assessment system. 

Each of these changes may increase the rate of FDIC insurance assessments to maintain or replenish the FDIC&#8217;s DIF. This could, in turn, raise the Bank&#8217;s future deposit insurance assessment costs. On the other hand, the law changes the deposit insurance assessment base so that it will generally be equal to consolidated assets less tangible equity. This change of the assessment base from an emphasis on deposits to an emphasis on assets is generally considered likely to cause larger banking organizations to pay a disproportionately higher portion of future deposit insurance assessments, which may, correspondingly, lower the level of deposit insurance assessments that smaller community banks such as the Bank may otherwise have to pay in the future. While it is likely that the new law will increase the Bank&#8217;s future deposit insurance assessment costs, the specific amount by which the new law&#8217;s combined changes will affect the Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment costs is hard to predict, particularly because the new law gives the FDIC enhanced discretion to set assessment rate levels. 

The FDIC also collects a deposit-based assessment from insured financial institutions on behalf of the Financing Corporation (the &#8220;FICO&#8221;). The funds from these assessments are used to service debt issued by FICO in its capacity as a financial vehicle for the Federal Savings &#38; Loan Insurance Corporation. These assessments will continue until the debt matures in 2017 through 2019. 

Payment of Dividends and Other Restrictions &#32; 

The Company is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Bank. While there are various legal and regulatory limitations under federal and state law governing the extent to which banks can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to holding companies, the principal source of cash revenues for the Company are dividends from the Bank. The relevant federal and state regulatory agencies also have authority to prohibit a national bank or bank holding company from engaging in conduct that, in the opinion 

of such regulatory body, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. The payment of dividends could, depending upon the financial condition of a bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its business. 

Insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; (as such term is defined in the applicable law and regulations). In addition, recently adopted capital rules limit capital distributions, including dividends, if the depository institution does not have a &#8220;capital conservation buffer.&#8221; See further details above under &#8220;Capital Adequacy.&#8221; 

National banks are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the OCC in order to declare and pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year would exceed the total of (1) such bank&#8217;s net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (2) its retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. In addition, these banks may only pay dividends to the extent that retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed bad debts (as defined by regulation). 

The Federal Reserve has expressed the view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding company&#8217;s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the holding company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if one or more of the holding company&#8217;s bank subsidiaries are classified as undercapitalized. 

A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should review their dividend policies, and has discouraged dividend payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital levels are strong. 

Transactions with Affiliates &#160; 

Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board limit the types and amounts of these transactions (including loans due and extensions of credit from their U.S. bank subsidiaries) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. In general, these regulations require that any &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company be limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary&#8217;s capital and surplus and, with respect to such parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary&#8217;s capital and surplus. Further, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. 

Interstate Banking and Branching &#32; 

Effective June 1, 1997, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines, with approval of the appropriate federal banking agency, unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to May 31, 1997 expressly prohibiting interstate mergers. Under the Riegle-Neal Act amendments, once a state or national bank has established branches in a state, that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. If a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period, no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out, whether through an acquisition or de novo. 

However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the national branching requirements have been relaxed and national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;), requires that the OCC review (1) any merger or consolidation by or with an insured bank, or (2) any establishment of branches by an insured bank. 

Loans to Directors, Executive Officers and Principal Shareholders &#32; 

The authority of the Bank to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, including their immediate family members, corporations and other entities that they control, is subject to substantial restrictions and requirements under Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder, as well as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These statutes and regulations impose specific limits on the amount of loans that the Bank may make to directors and other insiders, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans that exceed certain amounts. In addition, all loans the Bank makes to directors and other insiders must satisfy the following requirements: 

&#8226; 

the loans must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the Bank; 

&#8226; 

the Bank must follow credit underwriting procedures at least as stringent as those applicable to comparable transactions with persons who are not affiliated with the Bank; and 

&#8226; 

the loans must not involve a greater than normal risk of non-payment or include other features not favorable to the Bank. 

Furthermore, the Bank must periodically report all loans made to directors and other insiders to the bank regulators, and these loans are closely scrutinized by the regulators for compliance with Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O. Each loan to directors or other insiders must be pre-approved by the Bank&#8217;s board of directors with the interested director abstaining from voting. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act &#32; 

The CRA requires federal bank regulatory agencies to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of low and moderate-income borrowers in their local communities. An institution&#8217;s size and business strategy determines the type of examination that it will receive. Large, retail-oriented institutions are examined using a performance-based lending, investment and service test. Small institutions are examined using a streamlined approach. All institutions may opt to be evaluated under a strategic plan formulated with community input and pre-approved by the bank regulatory agency. 

The CRA regulations provide for certain disclosure obligations. Each institution must post a notice advising the public of its right to comment to the institution and its regulator on the institution&#8217;s CRA performance and to review the institution&#8217;s CRA public file. Each lending institution must maintain for public inspection a file that includes a listing of branch locations and services, a summary of lending activity, a map of its communities and any written comments from the public on its performance in meeting community credit needs. The CRA requires public disclosure of a financial institution&#8217;s written CRA evaluations. This requirement promotes enforcement of CRA principles by providing the public with the status of a particular institution&#8217;s community reinvestment record. 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act made various changes to the CRA. Among other changes, CRA agreements with private parties must be disclosed, and annual CRA reports must be made available to a bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. A bank holding company will not be permitted to become a financial holding company and no new activities authorized under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act may be commenced by a holding company or by a bank financial subsidiary if any of its bank subsidiaries received less than a satisfactory CRA rating in its latest examination. The Bank received a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; rating in its last CRA examination which was conducted on February 23, 2015. 

Consumer Laws and Regulations &#32; 

The Bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks. While the following list is not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Fair Housing Act, among others. These laws and regulations, among other things, prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, gender or other designated characteristics and mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers. These and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in the Bank&#8217;s activities. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits the state attorney general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 

The CFPB has finalized rules relating to, among other things, remittance transfers under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which requires companies to provide consumers with certain disclosures before the consumer pays for a remittance transfer. These rules became effective in October 2013. The CFPB has also amended certain rules under Regulation C relating to home mortgage disclosure to reflect a change in the asset-size exemption threshold for depository institutions based on the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. In addition, on January 10, 2013, the CFPB released its final &#8220;Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage&#8221; rules, which amended the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z). Regulation Z currently prohibits a creditor from making a higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer&#8217;s ability to repay the loan. The final rule implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer&#8217;s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; The final rule also implements section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits prepayment penalties. Finally, the final rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated. This rule became effective January 10, 2014. 

Technology Risk Management and Consumer Privacy &#32; 

Banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology. Under Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. Among other matters, the rules require each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. 

Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices. Section 502 prohibits a financial institution from disclosing nonpublic personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt-out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. All banks are also required to develop initial and annual privacy notices which describe in general terms the bank&#8217;s information sharing practices. Banks that share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt-out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure (with certain exceptions). Limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card, deposit or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing. 

UDAP and UDAAP &#32; 

Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address &#8220;unethical&#8221; or otherwise &#8220;bad&#8221; business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, referred to as the FTC Act, which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as UDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. &#8220;Unjustified consumer injury&#8221; is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,&#8221; referred to as UDAAP, which have been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. 

Monitoring and Reporting Suspicious Activity &#32; 

Under the Bank Secrecy Act (the &#8220;BSA&#8221;), financial institutions are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities, as well as transactions involving the transfer or withdrawal of amounts in excess of prescribed limits. The BSA is sometimes referred to as an &#8220;anti-money laundering&#8221; law (&#8220;AML&#8221;). Several AML statutes, including provisions in Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, have been enacted up to the present to amend the BSA. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards in their dealings with financial institutions and foreign customers. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are also required to establish anti-money laundering programs. The USA PATRIOT Act sets forth minimum standards for these programs, including: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls; 

&#8226; 

the designation of a compliance officer; 

&#8226; 

an ongoing employee training program; and 

&#8226; 

an independent audit function to test the programs. 

&#160; 

In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the &#8220;Treasury&#8221;), has adopted rules addressing a number of related issues, including increasing the cooperation and information sharing between financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement authorities regarding individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected based on credible evidence of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. Any financial institution complying with these rules will not be deemed to violate the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that are discussed below. Finally, under the regulations of the Office of Foreign Asset Control (the &#8220;OFAC&#8221;), we are required to monitor and block transactions with certain &#8220;specially designated nationals&#8221; who OFAC has determined pose a risk to U.S. national security. 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act &#32; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandates for public companies, such as the Company following the merger, a variety of reforms intended to address corporate and accounting fraud and provides for the establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &#8220;PCAOB&#8221;), which enforces auditing, quality control and independence standards for firms that audit SEC-reporting companies. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes higher standards for auditor independence and restricts the provision of consulting services by auditing firms to companies they audit and requires that certain audit partners be rotated periodically. The law also requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers, or their equivalents, to certify the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the SEC, subject to civil and criminal penalties if they knowingly or willfully violate this certification requirement, and increases the oversight and authority of audit committees of publicly traded companies. 

Annual Disclosure Statement
