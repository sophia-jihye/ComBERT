&#160; 

&#160; 

During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: 

&#160; &#160;(i) filing Exchange Act reports, and 

&#160; &#160;(ii) contractual obligations 

&#160; 

We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this report, we have limited cash. There are no assurances that we will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management's plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however there is no assurance of additional funding being available. 

We are in our early stages of development and growth, without established records of sales or earnings. We will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. 

On May 1, 2015, we entered into a 50 year, worldwide, exclusive intellectual property licensing agreement ("Agreement") with CanChew Biotechnologies, LLC ("CanChew"). As compensation for the Agreement, CanChew will receive 5,826,706 restricted shares of the Company's common stock and a royalty fee of approximately 2-3% of all gross sales derived from products produced under the Agreement. So long as we are in compliance with the Agreement, we have the option to purchase the licensed intellectual property after 5 years at a purchase price equal to fifty percent (50%) of the annual royalty fee paid. 

Manufacturing Capabilities 

On November 15, 2014, the Company entered into Reservation Agreement with the City of Almere, The Netherlands, whereby the Company was granted an option to purchase 5,328 square meters of land in the City of Almere. The Company intends to construct an office building on the site featuring: a clean laboratory zone, storage areas, office and technical rooms as well as manufacturing facility furnishings. This facility will be fully compliant with GMP, GLP, FDA, EMA and ISO regulations. The purchase price for the land is $ 985,680 Euros and the Company has until December 2015 to exercise the option free of charge. The Company exercised the second option period which is to expire September 2016. The Company was required to pay a reservation fee of $65,170 which it paid in October 2015. Should the Company purchase the land within one year from payment of the reservation fee, the reservation fee will be applied to the against the purchase price of the property. 

The Industry 

Hemp - An Overview 

Hemp is a cousin to cannabis as both are classified under the same botanical category of Cannabis sativa L. The major difference between the two is that recreational cannabis has significant amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5-20%), a psychotropic cannabinoid and very little amounts of CBD (cannabidiol) and CBG (cannabigerol), which have no psychotropic properties; whereas industrial hemp has virtually no THC (less than 0.3%). This 0.3% THC in industrial hemp is not enough to provide psychotropic effects, which renders industrial hemp useless for recreational use or abuse. Canada, China and the United Kingdom are examples of major industrialized countries that have grown industrial hemp responsibly deriving maximum economic benefits from its cultivation. 

Hemp is a plant easy to cultivate, with predictable harvests and produces overall negative carbon print compared to other agricultural sources used for production of biodiesels among other uses. 

Industrial hemp is reach in proteins and essential amino acids, which may render it as a preferred source of food and animal feed. 

Importation of Hemp Finished Products 

Despite classification of cannabis under Schedule I, hemp finished products, or certain parts of the plant Cannabis sativa , are exempted from the definition of marijuana and are considered legal to import since 1937. Under 21 U.S.C. &#65533; 802(16), the seeds (incapable of germination) and the mature stalks of the Cannabis sativa plant, together with products made from these parts, are exempted from the definition of cannabis. These products are commonly known as "hemp finished products", and can be a variety of products as outlined above. Importation of hemp finished products and processing into the United States continues legally, which fuels a hemp market inside the United States. The United States is actually the largest importer of hemp-based products in the world. 

Market, Customers and Distribution Methods 

To understand the market and consumers as well as distribution methods, we have studied all the uses of hemp and its legal structure in the U.S. and abroad. There are more than 25,000 known uses for hemp based products, most of which were used in the past and were replaced by cotton, petroleum\oil, concrete, corn and soybeans. We believe the market potentially represents trillions of dollars in worldwide product sales. We will focus on the products our management feels will have the greatest positive environmental impact, profitability and ease to market. These tend to be new, innovative products as well as the replacement of existing raw base materials for products that exist today, such as pharmaceuticals, nutriceuticals, plastics, fuel, textiles, and medical delivery devices. 

Our focus is on the development of innovative pharmaceutical, nutriceutical and cosmetic products focusing on diseases and conditions for which currently there are no known efficient therapeutic ingredients or delivery systems for known active pharmaceutical ingredients. The body of knowledge regarding therapeutic use of cannabinoid-based formulations is steadily increasing. We plan to be an active player in this field of biosciences with our extensive R&#38;D and pipeline of innovative products. 

Our target customers are first and foremost end consumers via Internet sales, direct-to-consumer health and wellness stores, collectives, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufactures of products that can readily replace their raw base materials with our materials, making the products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Next, we will target retail stores with major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments. 

Competition 

There are many developers of hemp-based consumer products, many of which are under-capitalized which we consider to be viable acquisition targets. We are currently in early-stage negotiations to purchase existing product lines, sources of industrial-hemp-derived-cannabinoids and other assets from certain competing companies. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based products but may do so in the future. 

Intellectual Property 

Currently, our intellectually property includes seventeen (17) trademarks (MedChew, AXIM, Cannanimals, CanQuit, CannaCoal, Clean Canna, Coal, Hemp Coal, CanChui CanShu, Green is the new gold, ORAXIMAX ReneCann, CannBleph, OphthoCann, Cannonich, Cannocyn, SuppoCann), some of which are allowed by the USPTO, and some of which have entered international stage seven (7) provisional patent applications (oral care, ophthalmic, sugar alcohol kneading method, antimicrobial, suppository delivery method, extraction process, and cosmetic), and one (1) licensed patent (chewing gum containing cannabinoids) with multiple extensions filed). We are in the process of developing and filing more patent applications. 

Research and Development 

We are continuing our research and development at the Free University of Amsterdam with our novel (patent pending) delivery system for treatment of patients with pain and spasticity as a sequence of Multiple Sclerosis. This study will include also the University of Plymouth, UK and academic centers in the US. The study is conducted in strict compliance with FDA/ EMA guidelines and is supervised by QPS as a CRO. The product tested is a pharmaceutical, functional chewing gum containing equal parts of THC and CBD. With our proprietary technology numerous problems related to cannabinoid' water-insolubility due to its lipophilic nature, bypass of first-pass liver metabolism and direct delivery into the systemic circulation have s been resolved. 

Clinical studies will commence at the University of Wageningen, The Netherlands testing a new (patent pending) delivery systems with novel cannabinoids for treatment of patients with IBS, IBD and Crohn's disease. A new direct as well as controlled slow-release nano-technology delivery methods will be investigated based on our proprietary IP. 

New, patent pending cannabinoid extraction techniques as well as pure, water soluble, freeze-dried cannabinoids are being developed in cooperation with Syncom, BV, The Netherlands, which practically solves the issue with very poor absorption of currently available, oil based cannabinoids. 

There are numerous other R&#38;D projects being considered involving our proprietary intellectual property. These will be strategically planned depending on availability of funds to carry on. 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 

The Company currently has arrangements with multiple reputable suppliers which are expected to meet the projected needs for materials for the upcoming year. 

Government Regulation 

For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United States, but on a limited basis. A landmark provision in the recently passed Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws in order to allow for crop research by universities, colleges and state agriculture departments. The new federal law, written by U.S. Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp "in states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp." 

Employees 

As of April 6, 2016, we have 6 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. We allow and utilize the services of independent contractors. We will be considering the conversion of some of our part-time employees to full-time positions. We are currently in discussions with qualified individuals to engage them for positions in sales and marketing, research and development, and operations. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees. 

Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws 

The expense of complying with environmental regulations is of minimal consequence.
