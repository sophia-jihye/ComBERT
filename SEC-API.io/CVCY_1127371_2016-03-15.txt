 ITEM 1 - 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Central Valley Community Bancorp (the Company) was incorporated on February 7, 2000 as a California corporation, for the purpose of becoming the holding company for Central Valley Community Bank (the Bank), formerly known as Clovis Community Bank, a California state chartered bank, through a corporate reorganization. In the reorganization, the Bank became the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the shareholders of the Bank became the shareholders of the Company. The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act), and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board of Governors). 

At December 31, 2015 , we had one banking subsidiary, the Bank. Our principal business is to provide, through our banking subsidiary, financial services in our primary market area in California. We serve seven contiguous counties in California&#8217;s central valley including Fresno County, Madera County, Merced County, Sacramento County, San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, and Tulare County, and their surrounding areas through the Bank. We do not currently conduct any operations other than through the Bank. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to us refer to the Company and the Bank on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2015 , we had consolidated total assets of approximately $1,276,736,000 . See Items 7 and 8 , Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , &#32;and Financial Statements . 

Effective July 1, 2013, the Company and Visalia Community Bank (VCB) completed a merger under which Visalia Community Bank, with three full-service offices in Visalia and one in Exeter, merged with and into the Bank. 

On August 18, 2011, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA) with the Small Business Lending Fund of the United States Department of the Treasury (the Treasury), under which the Company issued 7,000 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (Series C Preferred) to the Treasury for an aggregate purchase price of $7,000,000. Simultaneously, the Company agreed with Treasury under a Letter Agreement to redeem, for an aggregate price of $7,000,000, the 7,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock (Series A Stock) originally issued pursuant to the Treasury&#8217;s Capital Purchase Program (CPP) in 2009. The redemption of the Series A Stock resulted in an acceleration of the remaining discount booked at the time of the CPP transaction. In connection with the repurchase of the Series A Stock, the Company also repurchased the warrant (the Warrant) to purchase 79,037 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock that was originally issued to Treasury in connection with the CPP transaction for total consideration of $185,000. 

On December 31, 2013, the Company redeemed all 7,000 outstanding shares of its Series C Preferred from the Treasury, in exercise of its optional redemption rights pursuant to the terms of the Series C Preferred under the Company&#8217;s charter and the SPA. The Company paid the Treasury $7,087,500 in connection with the redemption, representing $1,000 per 

&#32;1 

share of the Series C Preferred plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through the date of the redemption. The obligations of the Company under the SPA are terminated as a result of the redemption. No shares of Series C Preferred remain outstanding. 

As of March 1, 2016, we had a total of 282 &#32;employees and 272 &#32;full time equivalent employees, including the employees of the Bank. 

&#160; 

The Bank 

&#160; 

The Bank was organized in 1979 and commenced business as a California state chartered bank in 1980. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) up to applicable limits. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. 

The Bank operates 21 &#32;full-service banking offices in Clovis, Exeter, Fresno, Kerman, Lodi, Madera, Merced, Modesto, Oakhurst, Prather, Sacramento, Stockton, Tracy, and Visalia. The Oakhurst and Madera branches were added through the Bank of Madera County merger in 2005. The Tracy, Stockton and Lodi offices were added through the merger with Service 1 st Bank in November of 2008. The Exeter and Visalia offices were added through the Visalia Community Bank merger in 2013. The Bank has a Real Estate Division, an Agribusiness Center and an SBA Lending Division in Fresno. All real estate related transactions are conducted and processed through the Real Estate Division, including interim construction loans for single family residences and commercial buildings. We offer permanent single family residential loans through our mortgage broker services. Our total market share of deposits in Fresno, Madera, and Tulare counties were 4.76% &#32;in 2015 &#32;compared to 4.81% &#32;in 2014 &#32;based on FDIC deposit market share information published as of June 30, 2015. 

The Bank of Madera County (BMC) was merged with and into the Bank on January 1, 2005. The transaction was a combination of cash and stock and was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. BMC had two branches in Madera County which continue to be operated by the Bank. 

In November of 2008, the Company acquired Service 1 st and its banking subsidiary, S1 Bank, adding three branches located in Tracy, Stockton and Lodi, California. 

In 2009, we opened a new full service office in Merced, California and relocated our Oakhurst office to a new smaller facility in a more desirable location. 

In 2010, the Company expanded the existing Modesto loan production office opened in 2007, to a larger full-service branch. 

In 2013, the Company acquired Visalia Community Bank, adding four branches located in Exeter and Visalia, California. 

Branch expansions provide the Company with opportunities to expand its loan and deposit base; however, based on past experience, management expects these new offices may initially have a negative impact on earnings until the volume of business grows to cover fixed overhead expenses. The Bank anticipates additional future branch openings to meet the growing service needs of its customers, although none are planned during 2016. After extensive analysis combined with the rising popularity of online and mobile banking trends, the Company has chosen to consolidate the Sunnyside office into our Fresno Downtown office in April 2016. 

The Bank conducts a commercial banking business, which includes accepting demand, savings and time deposits and making commercial, real estate and consumer loans. It also provides domestic and international wire transfer services and provides safe deposit boxes and other customary banking services. The Bank also has offered Internet banking since 2000. Internet banking consists of inquiry, account status, bill paying, account transfers, and cash management. The Bank does not offer trust services or international banking services and does not currently plan to do so in the near future. 

The Company terminated its interest in Central Valley Community Insurance Services, LLC (CVCIS) at the beginning of the third quarter of 2015. The Bank&#8217;s interest in CVCIS was originally established in 2006 for the purpose of providing health, commercial property and casualty insurance products and services primarily to business customers. The operating results of CVCIS were not significant to the Company&#8217;s operations. The termination of this entity did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. 

Since August of 1995 the Bank has been a party to an agreement with Investment Centers of America, pursuant to which Investment Centers of America provides Bank customers with access to investment services. In connection with entering into this agreement, the Bank adopted a policy intended to comply with FDIC Regulation Section 337.4, which outlines the guidelines under which an insured non-member bank may be affiliated with a company that directly engages in the sale, distribution, or underwriting of stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities. 

The Bank&#8217;s operating policy since its inception has emphasized serving the banking needs of individuals and the business and professional communities in the central valley area of California. At December 31, 2015 , we had total loans of $598,111,000 . Total commercial and industrial loans outstanding were $102,197,000 , total agricultural land and production loans outstanding were $30,472,000 , total real estate construction and other land loans outstanding were $38,685,000 ; total other real estate loans outstanding were $371,541,000 , total equity loans and lines of credit were $42,296,000 &#32;and total consumer installment loans outstanding were $12,503,000 . We accept real estate, listed securities, savings and time deposits, automobiles, inventory, accounts receivable, machinery and equipment as collateral for loans. 

&#32;2 

No individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to the Bank&#8217;s assets or deposits, or in relation to the overall business of the Company. However, at December 31, 2015 &#32;approximately 75.7% &#32;of our loan portfolio held for investment consisted of real estate-related loans, including construction loans, equity loans and lines of credit and commercial loans secured by real estate and 22.2% &#32;consisted of commercial loans. See Item 7 &#32;&#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe that these concentrations are mitigated by the diversification of our loan portfolio among commercial, real estate and consumer loans. In addition, our business activities currently are mainly concentrated in Fresno, Madera, Merced, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare County, California. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in this part of the California economy and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. Further, our concentration of operations in this area of California exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires, droughts, and floods in this region, or as a result of energy shortages in California. 

Our deposits are attracted from individual and commercial customers. A material portion of our deposits have not been obtained from a single person or a few persons, the loss of any one or more of which would not have a material adverse effect on our business. 

In order to attract loan and deposit business from individuals and small businesses, we maintain the following lobby hours at our branches:

* The Sunnyside office is scheduled for closure and consolidation with the Fresno Downtown office in April 2016. 

Automated teller machines operate at 19 branch locations. All operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. No automated teller machines are currently located at the Sacramento office. Our Real Estate, Small Business Administration (SBA) Departments and Agribusiness office maintain business hours of 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., Monday through Friday, and extended hours are available upon customer request. 

&#32;4 

To compete effectively, we rely substantially on local promotional activity, personal contacts by our officers, directors and employees, referrals by our shareholders, extended hours, personalized service and our reputation in the communities we serve. 

In Fresno and Madera Counties, in addition to our 11 full-service branch locations serving the Bank&#8217;s primary service areas, as of June 30, 2015 there were 147 &#32;operating banking and credit union offices in our primary service area, which consists of the cities of Clovis, Fresno, Kerman, Oakhurst, Madera, and Prather, California. Prather does not contain any banking offices other than our office. The June 2015 FDIC Summary of Deposits report indicated the Company had 4.76% &#32;of the total deposits held by all depositories in Fresno County and 8.62% &#32;in Madera County. In San Joaquin County, in addition to our three full service branch locations, as of June 30, 2015 there were 102 &#32;operating banking and credit union offices. The FDIC Summary of Deposits as of June 2015 report indicated the Company had 1.67% &#32;of total deposits held by all depositories in San Joaquin County. In Merced County, in addition to our one branch, as of June 30, 2015 there were 30 &#32;operating banking and credit union offices in our primary service area. In Sacramento County, in addition to our one branch, as of June 30, 2015 there were 225 &#32;operating banking and credit union offices in our primary service area. In Stanislaus County, in addition to our one branch, there were 88 &#32;operating banking and credit union offices in our primary service area. In Tulare County, in addition to our four branches there were 55 &#32;operating banking and credit union offices in our primary service area. Business activity in our primary service area is oriented toward light industry, small business and agriculture. 

The banking business in California generally, and our primary service area specifically, is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits, and is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area. Among the advantages such major banks have over us is their ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets, including loans, to regions of higher yield and demand. Major banks offer certain services such as international banking and trust services which we do not offer directly but which we usually can offer indirectly through correspondent institutions. In addition, by virtue of their greater total capitalization, such banks have substantially higher lending limits than we do. Legal lending limits to an individual customer are limited to a percentage of our total capital. As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s legal lending limits to individual customers were $17,173,000 &#32;for unsecured loans and $28,622,000 &#32;for unsecured and secured loans combined. As of December 31, 2015 the Bank&#8217;s largest lending relationships totaled $139,205,000 on an unsecured basis and $85,890,000 on a secured basis. 

&#160; For borrowers desiring loans in excess of the Bank&#8217;s lending limits, the Bank makes, and may in the future make, such loans on a participation basis with other community banks taking the amount of loans in excess of the Bank&#8217;s lending limits. In other cases, the Bank may refer such borrowers to larger banks or other lending institutions. 

Other entities, both governmental and in private industry, seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities also provide competition for us in the acquisition of deposits. Banks also compete with money market funds and other money market instruments, which are not subject to interest rate ceilings. In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal finance software. Competition for deposit and loan products remains strong, from both banking and non-banking firms, and affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers. 

Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets. Technological innovation has, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously have been traditional banking products. In addition, customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mail, home computer, ATMs, remote deposit, mobile banking applications, self-service branches, and in-store branches. 

Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues to remain competitive. In addition, competition has intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws, which permit banking organizations to expand geographically with fewer restrictions than in the past. Such laws allow banks to merge with other banks across state lines, thereby enabling banks to establish or expand banking operations in our market. The competitive environment also is significantly impacted by federal and state legislation, which may make it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with us.

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, including the recognition of interest income on loans. Interest income from nonaccrual loans is recorded only if collection of principal in full is not in doubt and when cash payments, if any, are received. 

Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and any accrued but unpaid interest income is reversed and charged against income when the payment of interest or principal is 90 days or more past due. Loans in the nonaccrual category are treated as nonaccrual loans even though we may ultimately recover all or a portion of the interest due. These loans return to accrual status when the loan becomes contractually current, future collectability of amounts due is reasonably assured, and a minimum 

&#32;12 

of six months of satisfactory principal repayment performance has occurred. See Note 5 &#32;of the Company&#8217;s audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 &#32;of this Annual Report. 

Included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;were four &#32;loans totaling $1,337,000 &#32;that were considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). None of these TDR loans were in default at December 31, 2015 . There are no outstanding commitments to lend additional funds to any of these borrowers. Included in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2014 &#32;were three &#32;loans that totaled $1,826,000 &#32;that were considered to be TDRs at December 31, 2014 . At December 31, 2013 , the Company had ten &#32;loans totaling $4,595,000 &#32;that were on nonaccrual and considered TDR. The Company had seven &#32;loans at December 31, 2012 &#32;totaling $9,245,000 &#32;that were considered to be TDRs. As of December 31, 2011 , the Company had six &#32;loans totaling $10,601,000 &#32;that were on nonaccrual and considered TDR. See Note 5 &#32;of the Company&#8217;s audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 &#32;of this Annual Report concerning our recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized. Impaired loans are identified from internal credit review reports, past due reports, overdraft listings, and third party reports of examination. Borrowers experiencing problems such as operating losses, marginal working capital, inadequate cash flow or business interruptions which jeopardize collection of the loan are also reviewed for possible impairment classification. 

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due, including principal and interest, according to the contractual terms of the original agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower&#8217;s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans determined to be impaired are individually evaluated for impairment. When a loan is impaired, the Company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, it may measure impairment based on a loan&#8217;s observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. A loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral. We perform quarterly internal reviews on substandard loans. We place loans on nonaccrual status and classify them as impaired when a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectability of interest and principal under the original contractual terms, or when loans are delinquent 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Management maintains certain loans that have been brought current by the borrower (less than 30 days delinquent) on nonaccrual status until such time as management has determined that the loans are likely to remain current in future periods. Foregone interest on nonaccrual loans totaled $340,000 &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;of which $104,000 &#32;was attributable to troubled debt restructurings. Foregone interest on nonaccrual loans was $716,000 &#32;and $661,000 &#32;for 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively of which $139,000 &#32;and $279,000 &#32;was attributable to troubled debt restructurings, respectively. 

Other than as discussed above, as of December 31, 2015 , we had no loans where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as impaired loans.

Managing credits identified through the risk evaluation methodology includes developing a business strategy with the customer to mitigate our losses. Our management continues to monitor these credits with a view to identifying as early as possible when, and to what extent, additional provisions may be necessary. 

The allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by the Bank&#8217;s and our Board of Directors&#8217; Audit/Compliance Committee. Reserves are allocated to loan portfolio segments using percentages which are based on both historical risk elements such as delinquencies and losses and predictive risk elements such as economic, competitive and environmental factors. We have adopted the specific reserve approach to allocate reserves to each impaired asset for the purpose of estimating potential loss exposure. Although the allowance for credit losses is allocated to various portfolio categories, it is general in nature and available for the loan portfolio in its entirety. Additions may be required based on the results of independent loan portfolio examinations, regulatory agency examinations, or our own internal review process. Additions are also required when, in management&#8217;s judgment, the reserve does not properly reflect the potential loss exposure. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $600,000 . The amount of provision is primarily the result of our assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses considering a number of factors, including the increase or decrease in the volume of outstanding loans and the level of net recoveries during the year. The provision of $7,985,000 in 2014 was recorded in connection with the partial charge off of a single commercial and agricultural relationship. Net charge-offs were $8,885,000 in 2014. No provision was added to the allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2013, and net charge-offs were $925,000. The provision for credit 

&#32;14 

losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $700,000 and net charge-offs were $1,963,000. For 2011, the provision was $1,050,000 and net charge offs which were $668,000. 

Using the criteria on the previous page, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses is set forth below:

Loans are charged to the allowance for credit losses when the loans are deemed uncollectible. It is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance so that it remains adequate to cover all probable loan charge offs that exist in the portfolio at that time. We assign qualitative and environmental factors (Q factors) to each loan category. Q factors include reserves held for the effects of lending policies, economic trends, and portfolio trends along with other dynamics which may cause additional stress to the portfolio.

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

The banking and financial services businesses in which we engage are highly regulated. Such regulation is intended, among other things, to protect depositors whose deposits are insured by the FDIC and the banking system as a whole. The monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Board of Governors, also influence the commercial banking business. The Board of Governors implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession) by its open-market operations in United States Government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial intermediaries subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The actions of the Board of Governors in these 

&#32;16 

areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. Indirectly such actions may also affect the ability of non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Bank. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted. 

The laws, regulations, and policies affecting financial services businesses are continuously under review by Congress and state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies. From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial intermediaries. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial intermediaries are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and before various bank regulatory and other professional agencies. Changes in the laws, regulations or policies that affect us cannot necessarily be predicted, but they may have a material effect on our business and earnings. 

&#160; 

BANK HOLDING COMPANY REGULATION 

&#160; 

The Company, as a bank holding company, is subject to regulation under the BHC Act, and is subject to the supervision and examination of the Board of Governors. Pursuant to the BHC Act, we are required to obtain the prior approval of the Board of Governors before we may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to such acquisition, we would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of such bank. 

Under the BHC Act, we may not engage in any business other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to our subsidiaries that the Board of Governors deems to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking. We are also prohibited, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company unless the company is engaged in banking activities or the Board of Governors determines that the activity is so closely related to banking to be a proper incident to banking. The Board of Governors&#8217; approval must be obtained before the shares of any such company can be acquired and, in certain cases, before any approved company can open new offices. 

The BHC Act and regulations of the Board of Governors also impose certain constraints on the redemption or purchase by a bank holding company of its own shares of stock. 

Our earnings and activities are affected by legislation, by actions of regulators, and by local legislative and administrative bodies and decisions of courts in the jurisdictions in which both the Company and the Bank conduct business. For example, these include limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company and the ability of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders. It is the policy of the Board of Governors that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. In addition to these explicit limitations, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 

In addition, banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law in dealings with their holding companies and other affiliates. Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, a bank can make a loan or extend credit to an affiliate, purchase or invest in the securities of an affiliate, purchase assets from an affiliate, accept securities of an affiliate as collateral security for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company, issue a guarantee, or accept letters of credit on behalf of an affiliate only if the aggregate amount of the above transactions of such subsidiary does not exceed 10 percent of such subsidiary&#8217;s capital stock and surplus on a per affiliate basis or 20 percent of such subsidiary&#8217;s capital stock and surplus on an aggregate affiliate basis. Such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. A bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase a &#8220;low-quality asset,&#8221; as that term is defined in the Federal Reserve Act, from an affiliate. Such restrictions also generally prevent a holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the holding company unless the loans are secured by collateral. 

A holding company and its banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property or provision of services. For example, with certain exceptions a bank may not condition an extension of credit on a customer obtaining other services provided by it, a holding company or any of its other bank affiliates, or on a promise by the customer not to obtain other services from a competitor. 

The Board of Governors has cease and desist powers over parent bank holding companies and non-banking subsidiaries where actions of a parent bank holding company or its non-financial institution subsidiaries represent an unsafe or unsound practice or violation of law. The Board of Governors has the authority to regulate debt obligations (other than commercial paper) issued by bank holding companies by imposing interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt obligations.

We are also a bank holding company within the meaning of Section 3700 of the California Financial Code. As such, we and our subsidiaries are subject to examination by the Department of Business Oversight (DBO). 

Further, we are required by the Board of Governors to maintain certain capital levels. See &#8220;Capital Standards.&#8221; 

&#160; 

REGULATION OF THE BANK 

Banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The Bank, as a California state-chartered bank, is subject to primary supervision, regulation and periodic examination by the DBO and the FDIC. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, but is nevertheless subject to certain regulations of the Board of Governors. 

If, as a result of an examination of a bank, the FDIC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to the FDIC. Such remedies include the power to enjoin &#8220;unsafe or unsound&#8221; practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in capital, to restrict the growth of the Bank, to assess civil monetary penalties, to remove officers and directors, and ultimately to terminate the Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance, which for a California chartered bank would result in a revocation of the Bank&#8217;s charter. The DBO has many of the same remedial powers. 

The Bank is a member of the FDIC, which currently insures customer deposits in each member bank to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor. For this protection, the Bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the FDIC, and, as is the case with all insured banks, may be required to pay a semi-annual statutory assessment. All of a depositors&#8217; accounts at an insured depository institution, including all non-interest bearing transactions accounts, will be insured by the FDIC up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount of ($250,000) for each deposit insurance ownership category. 

Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the State of California and the United States affect the operations of the Bank. State and federal statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations, including standards for safety and soundness, reserves against deposits, interest rates payable on deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowings, dividends, locations of branch offices, fair lending requirements, Community Reinvestment Act activities, and loans to affiliates. 

&#160; 

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS 

&#160; 

THE COMPANY 

&#160; 

Our shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our Board of Directors, out of funds legally available, subject to the dividends preference, if any, on preferred shares that may be outstanding, and also subject to the restrictions of the California Corporations Code. See Note 14 &#32;of the Company&#8217;s audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 &#32;of this Annual Report concerning preferred stock issued through the Small Business Lending Fund of the United States Department of the Treasury on August 18, 2011. 

The principal source of cash revenue to the Company is dividends received from the Bank. The Bank&#8217;s ability to make dividend payments to the Company is subject to state and federal regulatory restrictions. 

&#160; 

THE BANK 

&#160; 

Dividends payable by the Bank to the Company are restricted under California law to the lesser of the Bank&#8217;s retained earnings, or the Bank&#8217;s net income for the latest three fiscal years, less dividends paid during that period, or, with the approval of the DBO, to the greater of the retained earnings of the Bank, the net income of the Bank for its last fiscal year or the net income of the Bank for its current fiscal year. 

In addition to the regulations concerning minimum uniform capital adequacy requirements described below, the FDIC has established guidelines regarding the maintenance of an adequate allowance for credit losses. Therefore, the future payment of cash dividends by the Bank will generally depend, in addition to regulatory constraints, upon the Bank&#8217;s earnings during any fiscal period, the assessment of the Board of Directors of the capital requirements of the Bank and other factors, including the maintenance of an adequate allowance for credit losses. 

&#160; 

CAPITAL STANDARDS 

&#160; 

Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. 

&#32;18 

The Board of Governors, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies have issued risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, and transactions, such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements, which are reported as off-balance-sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance-sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as certain U.S. government securities, to 100% for assets with relatively higher credit risk, such as business loans. 

A banking organization&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items. The regulators measure risk-adjusted assets and off-balance-sheet items against both total qualifying capital (the sum of Tier 1 capital and limited amounts of Tier 2 capital) and Tier 1 capital. Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets. Tier 2 capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity. The inclusion of elements of Tier 2 capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies. 

In December 2010, the i nternal Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, now officially identified as &#8220;Basel III,&#8221; which, when fully phased-in, would require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than currently required, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Basel III capital framework, among other things: 

&#8226; 

introduces as a new capital measure, Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), more commonly known in the United States as &#8220;Tier 1 Common,&#8221; and defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations; 

&#8226; 

when fully phased in, requires banks to maintain: (i) a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); (ii) an additional &#8220;SIFI buffer&#8221; for those large institutions deemed to be systemically important, ranging from 1.0% to 2.5%, and up to 3.5% under certain conditions; (iii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iv) a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (v) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter); and 

&#8226; 

an additional &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer,&#8221; generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented. 

In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies approved the U.S. version of Basel III. The federal bank regulatory agencies adopted version of Basel III revises the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with Basel III and to meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Although many of the rules contained in these final regulations are applicable only to large, internationally active banks, some of them apply on a phased in basis to all banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank. Among other things, the rules establish a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), a higher minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement (6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio (4.00% eliminating a 3.00% exception for higher rated banks). The new additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk weighted assets over each of the required capital ratios will be phased in from 2016 to 2019 and must be met to avoid limitations on the ability of the Company and the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. The additional &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; is also required for larger and more complex institutions. The new rules assign higher risk weighting to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rules also change the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities, mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities (with a one-time opt out option for Standardized Banks (banks with less than $250 billion of total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion of foreign exposures) which the Company and the Bank intend to exercise). The rules, including alternative requirements for smaller community financial institutions like the Company and the Bank, would be phased in through 2019. The implementation of the Basel III framework commenced on January 1, 2015. 

&#32;19 

A bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the FDIC to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels. As discussed above, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain certain levels of capital. The regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the Bank and the Company on a consolidated basis as of December 31, 2015 &#32;are as follows:

VOLCKER RULE 

The final rules adopted on December 10, 2013, to implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;, would prohibit insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions (&#8220;banking entities&#8221;) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments, for their own account. The final rules also impose limits on banking entities&#8217; investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. These rules became effective on April 1, 2014. Certain collateralized debt obligations (&#8220;CDOs&#8221;), securities backed by trust preferred securities which were initially defined as covered funds subject to the investment prohibitions, have been exempted to address the concern that many community banks holding such CDOs securities may have been required to recognize significant losses on those securities. 

Like the Dodd-Frank Act, the final rules provide exemptions for certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government obligations, insurance company activities, and organizing and offering hedge funds or private equity funds. The final rules also clarify that certain activities are not prohibited, including acting as agent, broker, or custodian. 

The compliance requirements under the final rules vary based on the size of the banking entity and the scope of activities conducted. Banking entities with significant trading operations will be required to establish a detailed compliance program and their CEOs will be required to attest that the program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the final rule. Independent testing and analysis of an institution&#8217;s compliance program will also be required. The final rules reduce the burden on smaller, less-complex institutions by limiting their compliance and reporting requirements. Additionally, a banking entity that does not engage in covered trading activities will not need to establish a compliance program. The Company and the Bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2015 that were subject to the final rule. Therefore, while these new rules may require us to conduct certain internal analysis and reporting, we believe that they will not require any material changes in our operations or business. 

USA PATRIOT ACT 

&#160; 

On October 26, 2001, President Bush signed the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act also made significant changes to the Bank Secrecy Act. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and of identifying customers when establishing new relationships and standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. For example, the enhanced due diligence policies, procedures, and controls generally require financial institutions to take reasonable steps: 

* To conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transaction; 

* To ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of, and the source of funds deposited into, each account as needed to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions; 

* To ascertain for any foreign bank, the shares of which are not publicly traded, the identity of the owners of the foreign bank, and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner; and 

* To ascertain whether any foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other foreign banks and, if so, the identity of those foreign banks and related due diligence information. 

Under the USA PATRIOT Act, financial institutions are to establish anti-money laundering programs to enhance their Bank Secrecy Act program. The USA PATRIOT Act sets forth minimum standards for these programs, including: 

&#32;20 

* The development of internal policies, procedures, and controls; 

* The designation of a compliance officer; 

* An ongoing employee training program; and 

* An independent audit function to test the programs. 

Bank management believes that the Bank is currently in compliance with the US PATRIOT Act. 

&#160; 

FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION LEGISLATION 

&#160; 

On November 12, 1999, President Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act. This legislation eliminated many of the barriers that have separated the insurance, securities and banking industries since the Great Depression. The federal banking agencies (the Board of Governors, FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) among others, continue to draft regulations to implement the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act is the result of a decade of debate in the Congress regarding a fundamental reformation of the nation&#8217;s financial system. The law is subdivided into seven titles, by functional area. 

The major provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act are: 

FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES AND FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES. Title I establishes a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms, and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the BHC Act framework to permit a holding company system to engage in a full range of financial activities through qualification as a new entity known as a financial holding company. 

Final regulations adopted by the FDIC in January 2001, in the form of amendments to Part 362 of the FDIC rules and regulations, provide the framework for subsidiaries of state nonmember banks to engage in financial activities that the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits national banks to conduct through a financial subsidiary. 

Activities permissible for financial subsidiaries of national banks, and, pursuant to Section 362 of the FDIC rules and regulations, also permissible for financial subsidiaries of state nonmember banks, include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) Lending, exchanging, transferring, investing for others, or safeguarding money or securities; (b) Insuring, guaranteeing, or indemnifying against loss, harm, damage, illness, disability, or death, or providing and issuing annuities, and acting as principal, agent, or broker for purposes of the foregoing, in any State; (c) Providing financial, investment, or economic advisory services, including advising an investment company; (d) Issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly; and (e) Underwriting, dealing in, or making a market in securities. 

SECURITIES ACTIVITIES. Title II narrows the exemptions from the securities laws previously enjoyed by banks and creates a new, voluntary investment bank holding company. The Board of Governors and the SEC continue to work together to draft rules governing certain securities activities of banks. 

INSURANCE ACTIVITIES. Title III restates the proposition that the states are the functional regulators for all insurance activities, including the insurance activities of federally-chartered banks, and bars the states from prohibiting insurance activities by depository institutions. 

PRIVACY. Under Title V, federal banking regulators were required to adopt rules that have limited the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. Federal banking regulators issued final rules on May 10, 2000 to implement the privacy provisions of Title V. Under the rules, financial institutions must provide: 

* initial notices to customers about their privacy policies, describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates; 

* annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers; and 

* a reasonable method for customers to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties. 

Compliance with these rules was mandatory after July 1, 2001. The Company and the Bank were in full compliance with the rules as of or prior to their respective effective dates. 

SAFEGUARDING CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER INFORMATION. Under Title V, federal banking regulators are required to adopt rules requiring financial institutions to implement a program to protect confidential customer information. In January 2000, the federal banking agencies adopted guidelines requiring financial institutions to establish an information security program. 

The Bank implemented a security program appropriate to its size and complexity and the nature and scope of its operations prior to the July 1, 2001 effective date of the regulatory guidelines, and since initial implementation has, as necessary, updated and improved that program. 

COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT SUNSHINE REQUIREMENTS. The federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations implementing Section 711 of Title VII of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Sunshine Requirements. The regulations require nongovernmental entities or persons and insured depository institutions and affiliates that are parties to written agreements made in connection with the fulfillment of the institution&#8217;s CRA obligations to make available to the public and the federal banking agencies a copy of each agreement. Neither the Company nor the Bank is a party to any agreement that would be the subject of reporting pursuant to the CRA Sunshine Requirements. 

&#32;21 

The Company continues to evaluate the strategic opportunities presented by the broad powers granted to bank holding companies that elect to be treated as financial holding companies. In the event that the Company determines that access to the broader powers of a financial holding company is in the best interests of the Company, its shareholders and the Bank, the Company will file the appropriate election with the Board of Governors. 

The Company and the Bank intend to comply with all provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and all implementing regulations as they become effective. 

CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

&#160; 

The bank regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations. Examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature, and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred rulemaking authority for many consumer protection laws from various Federal agencies to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The Bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, some of which are discussed below. 

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is intended to encourage insured depository institutions, while operating safely and soundly, to help meet the credit needs of their communities. The CRA specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies, in examining insured depository institutions, to assess a bank&#8217;s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The CRA further requires the agencies to take a financial institution&#8217;s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, mergers or acquisitions, or holding company formations. The agencies use the CRA assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution. The ratings range from a high of &#8220;outstanding&#8221; to a low of &#8220;substantial noncompliance.&#8221; The Bank was last examined for CRA compliance by its primary regulator, the FDIC, as of February 2013. 

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. 

The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. As a result of the TILA, all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments, including the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount financed, the total of payments and the payment schedule, among other things. 

The Fair Housing Act (FH Act) regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. A number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be, or may be considered, illegal under the FH Act, including some that are not specifically mentioned in the FH Act itself. 

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods and provides public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The HMDA also includes a &#8220;fair lending&#8221; aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes. 

Finally, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements. Also, RESPA prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts. Penalties under the above laws may include fines, reimbursements and other civil money penalties. 

Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with the CRA, TILA, FH Act, ECOA, HMDA and RESPA generally, the Bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local community. 

&#160; 

CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT/FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT 

&#160; 

In 1970, the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (the FCRA) was enacted to insure the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy and proper utilization of consumer credit report information. Under the framework of the FCRA, the United States has developed a highly advanced and efficient credit reporting system. The information contained in that broad system is used by financial institutions, retailers and other creditors of every size in making a wide variety of decisions regarding financial transactions. Employers and law enforcement agencies have also made wide use of the information collected and maintained in databases made possible by the FCRA. The FCRA affirmatively preempts state law in a number of areas, including the ability of entities affiliated by common ownership to share and exchange information freely, and the requirements on credit bureaus to reinvestigate the contents of reports in response to consumer complaints, among others. 

The California Financial Information Privacy Act, which was enacted in 2003, requires a financial institution to provide specific information to a consumer related to the sharing of that consumer&#8217;s nonpublic personal information. The Act 

&#32;22 

allows a consumer to direct the financial institution not to share his or her nonpublic personal information with affiliated or nonaffiliated companies with which a financial institution has contracted to provide financial products and services, and requires that permission from each such consumer be acquired by a financial institution prior to sharing such information. 

The FACT Act, (Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act) became law in 2003, effectively extending and amending provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The FACT Act created many new responsibilities for consumer reporting agencies and users of consumer reports. It contains many new consumer disclosure requirements as well as provisions to address identity theft. 

CHECK 21 ACT 

&#160; 

On December 22, 2003, the Board of Governors amended Regulation CC and its commentary to implement the Check Clearing for the 21 st Century Act (Check 21 Act). The Check 21 Act became effective on October 28, 2004. 

To facilitate check truncation and electronic check exchange, the Check 21 Act authorizes a new negotiable instrument called a &#8220;substitute check&#8221; and provides that a properly prepared substitute check is the legal equivalent of the original check for all purposes. A substitute check is a paper reproduction of the original check that can be processed just like the original check. The Check 21 Act does not require any bank to create substitute checks or to accept checks electronically. The amendments: 1) set forth the requirements of the Check 21 Act that applies to banks; 2) provide a model disclosure and model notices relating to substitute checks; and 3) set forth bank endorsement and identification requirements for substitute checks. 

The Bank has been imaging its customers&#8217; checks since 2000. Check 21 Act has had limited impact on the Bank. 

&#160; 

Other 

&#160; 

Other legislation which has been or may be proposed to the United States Congress and the California Legislature and regulations which may be proposed by the Board of Governors, FDIC and the DBO may affect our business. It cannot be predicted whether any pending or proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted or the effect such legislation or regulations may have upon our business.
