 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

Our Corporate History and Background

&#160;

The Company was organized on October 4, 2011 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name SMSA Ballinger Acquisition Corp. to effect the reincorporation of Senior Management Services of Heritage Oaks at Ballinger, Inc., a Texas corporation, mandated by a Plan of Reorganization confirmed by the United States Bankruptcy Court For the Northern District of Texas for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

On August 1, 2013 we entered into a share purchase agreement with Orsolya Peresztegi pursuant to which she acquired 9.5 million shares of our Company Common Stock, par value $0.001 ("Common Stock") for $9,500 cash, or $0.001 per share. As a result of this transaction, there was a change in control of the Company, resulting in Ms. Peresztegi owning 94.7% of our 10,030,612 outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. As a result of the transaction, Ms. Peresztegi became the Company's sole director and officer.

We also entered into the Snotarator Distributor Agreement on August 1, 2013 which granted us the exclusive right to sell products of Snotarator LLC, a Frisco, Texas based Texas limited liability company owned by Orsolya Peresztegi and her husband, Kevin Halter, Jr. The distribution rights were limited to countries within South America. Since the Company had no prior experience in selling or marketing consumer products in South America, on April 15, 2014 we entered into a letter agreement with HFG (the "HFG Consulting Agreement") pursuant to which we engaged Halter Financial Group, Inc. ("HFG"), a Dallas, Texas consulting firm, specializing in the area of mergers, acquisition and corporate finance, to assist us with our initial marketing efforts in South America.

On May 15, 2015, the Company and Snotarator, L.L.C. extended the term of the Snotarator Distributor Agreement from May 15, 2015 to May 15, 2017 by mutual written agreement. The Snotarator Distributor Agreement related to the Snotarator and Snotaphant Nasal Aspirator products. Snotarator Nasal Aspirator and Snotaphant Nasal Aspirator are registered trademarks owned by Snotarator LLC, the use of which was granted to the Company pursuant to the terms of the distributor agreement.

On December 1 , 2015 , the Company entered into a Termination of Distributorship Agreement and Release with Snotarator LLC terminating the Snotarator Distributor Agreement. Also on December 1 , 2015 , the Company entered into a Termination of HFG Consulting Agreement and Release with HFG terminating the HFG Consulting Agreement.

Reverse Acquisition of Tiger Trade

&#160;

On December 1 , 2015 , the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement"), by and among the Company, Tiger Trade Technologies, Inc. ("Tiger Trade"), a Texas corporation and the stockholders of Tiger Trade . Tiger Trade had a total of 25 stockholders as of the date of the Exchange Agreement.

&#160;

The effect of the issuance was that, upon closing of the Exchange Agreement transaction, former Tiger Trade stockholders held approximately 85.91% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock. 

&#160;

&#160;

As a condition precedent to consummation of the Exchange Agreement, Orsolya Peresztegi , the Company's sole officer and director on the closing date of the transaction, effected the cancellation of Seven Million Ninety-Five Thousand Six Hundred Two (7,095,602) shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to a Cancellation Agreement effective as of the Exchange Agreement closing date. Under the terms of the Cancellation Agreement, Tiger Trade paid Ms. Peresztegi a cancellation fee of Two Hundred Forty-Five Thousand Dollars ($245,000).

Overview of Business

&#160;

The Company is in the business of developing, marketing and distributing a real time analytical platform to serve as a tool for day traders and swing traders on the OTC Markets Group, Inc. ("OTC"), NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ markets. Our proprietary technology is an algorithm driven system (the "Blackbox System") that works in real time, measuring market trends and data while utilizing a multitude of specific criteria, both live and historical. Our Blackbox System was designed to monitor and analyzes over 13,000 stocks on the NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX and OTC markets simultaneously as our servers receive live feeds from these markets. We consider the Blackbox System technology to be among the most user-friendly of its kind.

&#160;

&#160;

Development of the Blackbox System

Our former subsidiary, Tiger Trade, began the development of the Blackbox System, which is still in the development phase. The Company expects to complete development of the Blackbox System and the associated website/platform and interface in order to make it available to subscribers by the end of June 2016. As of December 31, 2015 the Company (and Tiger Trade) has incurred approximately $304,000 in research and development costs and expenses. In order to finalize the Blackbox System for sale and provide for costs associated with maintaining the Blackbox System, we expect to require approximately $1 Million over the next 12 months.

Marketing of the Blackbox System

The Blackbox System is expected to be sold on a monthly and/or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through our website/platform. We expect to price our Blackbox System subscription on a competitive basis with similar web-based trading tools. When the Blackbox System and website/platform are enterprise ready for sale, we plan to market our product to potential subscribers via online marketing. Our marketing plan includes, but is not limited to, online affiliate marketing, banner advertising, social media, and targeted email campaigns. We expect that costs associated with our proposed marketing operations will be between approximately $1 Million to $2 Million over the next 12 months. We expect to raise amounts necessary to implement our marketing plans through debt and/or equity financing from the sale of our Company Common Stock and reinvestment of profits generated through subscription revenue.

Intellectual Property

&#160;

We plan to rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product coding and marks. As of the date of this report, the Company has not yet registered any trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property associated with our business.

&#160;

Government Regulation and Approvals

&#160;

The Company will offer customers a trading tool and not a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore does not expect to be subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for our product.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

We intend to operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal resources necessary for the development of investment software tools and services and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of development and marketing operations are limited. We must compete for such resources with startups, major financial services companies and midsize competitors. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Our current operating and financial resources are not adequate to preclude any significant disruption of our operations.

Employees

As of the date hereof, the Company has one employee, Jeff Sharrock, who serves as Vice President of Operations. Until such time as the Company has sufficient resources to compensate additional employees, Gust Kepler who serves as our sole director and our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, and Mr. Sharrock will be primarily responsible for managing our administrative affairs.

Additional Information

We are required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a current report on Form 8-K.
