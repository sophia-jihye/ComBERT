One example of this technology is our proprietary 16-bit microcontroller core that is embedded in the digital portion of our mixed signal ASIC, which allows us to optimize our ASIC for position sensing tasks. Our embedded microcontroller provides great flexibility in customizing our products via firmware, which eliminates the need to design new circuitry for each new application. 

Fingerprint Sensing Technology . This technology provides for fingerprint authentication by scanning and matching an image of a user&#8217;s fingerprint, as well as initial fingerprint enrollment. Our sensing technology also incorporates spoof detection. Our fingerprint sensing technology simplifies the system or application authentication process by substituting the user&#8217;s fingerprint for the login name and password. Our technology includes many implementation choices including back of phone, button integration, touchpad integration, and under glass. 

Research and Development

We conduct ongoing research and development programs that focus on advancing our existing interface technologies, improving our current product solutions, developing new products, improving design and manufacturing processes, enhancing the quality and performance of our product solutions, and expanding our technologies to serve new markets. Our goal is to provide our customers with innovative solutions that address their needs and improve their competitive positions. Our long-term vision is to offer human interface semiconductor product solutions, such as touch, fingerprint, handwriting, vision, voice capabilities, and other biometrics that can be readily incorporated into various electronic devices.

Our research and development programs focus on the development of accurate, easy to use, reliable, and intuitive human interfaces for electronic devices. We believe our innovative interface technologies can be applied to many diverse products, and we believe the interface is a key factor in the differentiation of these products. We believe that our interface technologies enable us to provide customers with product solutions that have significant advantages over alternative technologies in terms of functionality, size, power consumption, durability, and reliability. We also intend to pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions to enhance our research and development capabilities, leverage our technology, and shorten our time to market with new technological applications.

Our research, design, and engineering teams frequently work directly with our customers to design custom solutions for specific applications. We focus on enabling our customers to overcome their technical barriers and enhance the performance of their products. We believe our engineering know-how and electronic systems expertise provide significant benefits to our customers by enabling them to concentrate on their core competencies of production and marketing.

As of the end of fiscal 2016, we employed 1,246 people in our technology, engineering, and product design functions in the United States, Taiwan, Japan, India, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Armenia. Our research and development expenses were approximately $311.2 million, $293.2 million, and $192.7 million for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Intellectual Property Rights 

Our success and ability to compete depend in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies and products. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality agreements, and other statutory and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property, but these measures may provide only limited protection. 

As of June 25, 2016, we held 816 active patents and 1,030 active patents pending worldwide. Collectively, these patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our key technologies, including those for opaque touchpads, clear touch screens, fingerprint sensors, and displays. Our proprietary firmware and software, including source code, are also protected by copyright laws and applicable trade secret laws.

Our extensive array of technologies includes those related to integrated circuits (ICs), firmware, software, and mechanical hardware. Our products rely on a combination of these technologies, making it difficult to use any single technology as the basis for replicating our products. Furthermore, the lengths of our customers&#8217; design cycles and the customizations required by our customers&#8217; products also serve to protect our intellectual property rights.

Customers

Our customers include many of the world&#8217;s largest smartphone, tablet, and PC OEMs, based on unit shipments, as well as a variety of consumer electronics manufacturers. Our demonstrated track record of technological leadership, design innovation, product performance, cost effectiveness, and on-time deliveries have resulted in our leadership position in providing human interface semiconductor product solutions. We believe our strong relationship with our OEM customers, many of which are also currently developing tablets and mobile application products, will continue to position us as a source of supply for their product offerings.

Our leading OEM customers in fiscal 2016 included the following:

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Acer 

&#183; &#160; LG Electronics 

&#183; &#160; Dell 

&#183; &#160; Oppo Mobile 

&#183; &#160; Hewlett-Packard 

&#183; &#160; Samsung 

&#183; &#160; Huawei 

&#183; &#160; Sony 

&#183; &#160; Lenovo 

&#183; &#160; Vivo 

&#183; &#160; LeTV 

&#183; &#160; Xiaomi 

&#160;

We generally supply custom-designed products to OEMs through their contract manufacturers, supply chains or distributors. Sales to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its affiliates, Sanshin Electronics Co., Ltd., and Fuhrmeister Electronics Co., Ltd. accounted for 21%, 20%, and 15% of our net revenue in fiscal 2016, respectively. 

We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers. Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our human interface semiconductor product solutions in their products. The contract manufacturers place orders with us for the purchase of our products, take title to the products purchased upon delivery by us, and pay us directly for those purchases. These customers have no return privileges except for warranty provisions.

Strategic Relationships

We have used strategic relationships to enhance our ability to offer value-added customer solutions in the past. We intend to enter into additional strategic relationships with companies that may help us serve our target markets.

Sales and Marketing

We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal engineering resources because of the highly technical nature of our product solutions. Sales frequently result from multi-level sales efforts that involve senior management, design engineers, and our sales personnel interacting with our customers' decision makers throughout the product development and order process.

As of the end of fiscal 2016, we employed 310 sales and marketing professionals. We maintain customer support offices domestically and internationally, which are located in the United States, Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Japan, and Europe. In addition, we utilize value-added resellers and sales distributors in China, Japan, and Taiwan. 

International sales constituted over 85% of our revenue for each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014. Approximately 81% of our sales in fiscal 2016 were made to companies located in China, Japan, and South Korea that provide design and manufacturing services for major notebook computer and mobile product applications OEMs. Our sales are almost exclusively denominated in U.S. dollars. This information should be read in conjunction with note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.

Manufacturing

We employ a virtual manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize a few semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply us with silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then utilized in our custom interface products or processed as our ASIC-based solution.

After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or are shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom human interface solution or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or by our contract manufacturers directly to our customers for integration into their products.

We diversify our production capacity through third-party relationships, thereby strengthening our virtual manufacturing platform. We believe our virtual manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances, and product design and engineering, and reduces our capital investment. 

Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. We do not, however, have long-term agreements with any of our contract manufacturers that guarantee production capacity, prices, lead times, or delivery schedules. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on few sources of supply. We believe, however, that other sources of supply are available. In addition, we may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any one source of supply.

Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances in which our customer has cancelled its order and we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations.

Backlog

As of the end of fiscal 2016, we had a backlog of orders of $182.8 million, an increase of $23.8 million compared with a backlog of orders as of the end of fiscal 2015 of $159.0 million. The quantity of units in backlog is higher for products ordered by customers at the end of fiscal 2016 than those ordered at the end of fiscal 2015, which is partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices due to the mix of products ordered by customers. Our backlog consists of products for which purchase orders have been received and which are scheduled for shipment in the subsequent quarter. Most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with limited penalties. Because of the possibility of customer changes in product shipments, our backlog as of a particular date may not necessarily be indicative of net revenue for any succeeding period.

Competition

Our touch, display and finger-based semiconductor products are sold into markets for mobile applications products, PC product applications and other electronic devices. The markets for touchscreen products are characterized by rapidly 

changing technology and intense competition. Our principal competition in the sale of touchscreen products includes Atmel, Elan Microelectronics, Focaltech Systems, Goodix, Melfas, Parade Technologies, Samsung LSI, STMicroelectron ics and various other companies involved in human interface semiconductor product solutions. Our principal competitors in the sale of notebook touch pads are Alps Electric and Elan Microelectronics. Our principal competitors in the sale of display driver products and TDDI products for the mobile and PC product applications markets include Focaltech, Himax Technologies, Novatek Microelectronics and SiliconWorks. Our principal competitors in the sale of fingerprint authentication solutions for the mobile a nd PC product applications markets are Cypress Semiconductor, Egis Technology, Elan Microelectronics, Fingerprint Cards, Goodix, IDEX, NEXT Biometrics, Silead and Qualcomm. In certain cases, large OEMs may acquire a competing technology, develop alternati ve human interface semiconductor product solutions for their own products or provide alternative key components for use in designing human interface semiconductor product solutions. 

We believe our solutions-based systems and engineering experience, coupled with our technologies, offer benefits in terms of size, power consumption, durability, ease of use, cost effectiveness, and reliability when compared to our competitors and other technologies. While our markets continue to evolve, we believe we are well positioned to compete aggressively for this business based on our proven track record, our technological expertise, our marquee global customer base, our technology roadmap, and our reputation for design innovation. Our competitive position could be adversely affected if one or more of our current OEMs reduce their orders or if we are unable to develop new customers for our human interface semiconductor product solutions.

Employees

As of the end of fiscal 2016, we employed a total of 1,763 persons, including 207 in operations, finance, and administration; 310 in sales and marketing; and 1,246 in research and development. Of these employees, 667 were located in North America, 1,087 in Asia/Pacific, and 9 in Europe. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good, and none of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us.

Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is extremely intense, particularly for engineering and other technical personnel. Our success depends on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel.
