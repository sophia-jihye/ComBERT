Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s operations are conducted through the Bank. The Bank, a Massachusetts trust company and state chartered commercial bank that commenced banking operations in 1989, has five wholly owned subsidiaries that are included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Enterprise Insurance Services, LLC, organized in 2000 in the State of Delaware for the purpose of engaging in insurance sales activities; 

&#8226; 

Enterprise Investment Services, LLC, organized in 2000 in the State of Delaware for the purpose of offering non-deposit investment products and services, under the name of "Enterprise Investment Services," and 

&#8226; 

Three Massachusetts security corporations, Enterprise Security Corporation (2005), Enterprise Security Corporation II (2007) and Enterprise Security Corporation III (2007), which hold various types of qualifying securities. The security corporations are limited to conducting securities investment activities that the Bank itself would be allowed to conduct under applicable laws. 

&#160; 

Enterprise&#8217;s headquarters are located at 222 Merrimack Street in Lowell, Massachusetts. 

&#160; 

The services offered through the Bank and its subsidiaries are managed as one strategic unit and represent the Company&#8217;s only reportable operating segment. 

&#160; 

All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

&#160; 

Market Area 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s primary market area is the greater Merrimack Valley and North Central regions of Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. Enterprise has 22 &#32;full-service branch banking offices located in the Massachusetts cities and towns of Acton, Andover, Billerica, Chelmsford, Dracut, Fitchburg, Lawrence, Leominster, Lowell, Methuen, Tewksbury, Tyngsboro and Westford; and in the New Hampshire towns of Derry, Hudson, Nashua, Pelham and Salem, which serve those cities and towns as well as the surrounding communities. Additionally, the Company has obtained regulatory approval and plans to open its second Nashua branch in the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Management actively seeks to strengthen its market position by capitalizing on market opportunities to grow all business lines and the continued pursuit of organic growth and strategic expansion within existing and into neighboring geographic markets. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

The Company principally is engaged in the business of gathering deposits from the general public and investing primarily in loans and investment securities and utilizing the resulting cash flows to conduct operations, expand the branch network, and pay dividends to stockholders. Through the Bank and its subsidiaries, the Company offers a range of commercial and consumer loan products, deposit products and cash management services; the Company also offers investment advisory and wealth management, trust and insurance services. Management continually examines new products and technologies in order to maintain a highly competitive mix of offerings and state-of-the-art delivery channels in order to tailor product lines to customers' needs. These products and services are outlined below. 

Lending Products 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Company specializes in lending to business entities, non-profit organizations, professionals and individuals. The Company&#8217;s primary lending focus is on the development of high quality commercial relationships achieved through active business development efforts, strong community involvement, focused marketing strategies, and long-term relationships with 

established commercial developers, growing businesses and non-profits. Loans made to businesses include commercial mortgage loans, construction and land development loans, secured and unsecured commercial loans and lines of credit, and standby letters of credit. The Company also originates equipment lease financing for businesses. Loans made to individuals include conventional residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines, residential construction loans on primary and secondary residences, and secured and unsecured personal loans and lines of credit. The Company seeks to manage its loan portfolio to avoid concentration by industry or loan size to lessen its credit risk exposure. 

Interest rates charged on loans may be fixed or variable; variable rate loans may have fixed initial periods before periodic rate adjustments begin. Individual rates offered are dependent on the associated degree of credit risk, term, underwriting and servicing costs, loan amount, and the extent of other banking relationships maintained with the borrower, and may be subject to interest rate floors. Rates are also subject to competitive pressures, the current interest rate environment, availability of funds, and government regulations. In 2015, the Company introduced a &#8220;Back-to-Back Swap&#8221; program that is available to qualified commercial banking customers. The customer interest-rate swap contract allows commercial banking customers to convert a floating-rate loan payment to fixed-rate loan payment while the Company simultaneously enters into an equal and opposite interest rate swap with an independent counterparty. The transaction structure effectively minimizes the Company's net interest rate risk exposure resulting from such transactions. 

Enterprise employs a seasoned commercial lending staff, with commercial lenders supporting each branch location. An internal loan review function assesses the compliance of commercial loan originations with the Company&#8217;s internal policies and underwriting guidelines and monitors the ongoing quality of the loan portfolio. The Company also contracts with an external loan review company to review loans in the commercial loan portfolio on a pre-determined schedule, based on the type, size, rating, and overall risk of the loan. 

The Company's internal residential origination and underwriting staff originate residential loans and are responsible for compliance with residential lending regulations, consumer protection and internal policy guidelines. The Company contracts with an external loan review company to complete a regular quality control review in accordance with secondary market underwriting requirements for residential mortgage loans sold. The sample reviewed is based on loan volume originated. Additionally, the Company's internal compliance department monitors the residential loan origination activity for regulatory compliance. 

A management loan review committee, consisting of senior lending officers, credit, loan workout and accounting personnel, is responsible for setting loan policy and procedures, as well as reviewing loans on the internal &#8220;watched asset list&#8221; and classified loan report. An internal credit review committee, consisting of senior lending officers and loan review personnel, meets to review loan requests related to borrowing relationships of certain dollar levels, as well as other borrower relationships recommended for discussion by committee members. 

&#160; 

The Executive Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the "Board") approves loan relationships exceeding certain prescribed dollar limits. The Loan Committee of the Board reviews current portfolio statistics, problem credits, construction loan reviews, watched assets, loan delinquencies, and the allowance for loan losses, as well as current market conditions and issues relating to the construction and real estate development industry and the reports from the external loan review company. The Board&#8217;s Loan Committee is also responsible for approval of credit-related charge-offs recommended by management. Approved charge-offs are forwarded to the full Board for ratification. In March 2016, these two board committees were merged, with all former duties and responsibilities carried forward to the surviving Loan Committee or the full Board. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s statutory lending limit, based on 20% of capital (capital stock plus surplus and undivided profits, but excluding other comprehensive income), to any individual borrower and related entities was approximately $37.9 million , subject to certain exceptions provided under applicable law. 

&#160; 

See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A and "Credit Risk" contained in Item 7, for further discussion on a variety of risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate, Commercial and Industrial, and Commercial Construction Loans 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by both owner-use and non-owner use real estate. These loans are typically secured by a variety of commercial and industrial property types, including one-to-four family and multi-family apartment buildings, office, industrial, or mixed-use facilities, strip shopping centers, or other commercial properties, and are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. Commercial real estate loans generally have repayment periods of approximately 

fifteen to twenty-five years. Variable interest rate loans in this portfolio have a variety of adjustment terms and indices, and are generally fixed for an initial period before periodic rate adjustments begin. 

&#160; 

Commercial and industrial loans include seasonal revolving lines of credit, working capital loans, equipment financing (including equipment leases), and term loans. Also included in commercial and industrial loans are loans partially guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), and loans under various programs and agencies. Commercial and industrial credits may be unsecured loans and lines to financially strong borrowers, secured in whole or in part by real estate unrelated to the principal purpose of the loan, or secured by inventories, equipment, or receivables, and are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrower. Variable rate loans and lines in this portfolio have interest rates that are periodically adjusted, with loans generally having fixed initial periods. Commercial and industrial loans have average repayment periods of one to seven years. 

&#160; 

Commercial construction loans include the development of residential housing and condominium projects, the development of commercial and industrial use property, and loans for the purchase and improvement of raw land. These loans are secured in whole or in part by the underlying real estate collateral and are generally guaranteed by the principals of the borrowers. Construction lenders work to cultivate long-term relationships with established developers. The Company limits the amount of financing provided to any single developer for the construction of properties built on a speculative basis. Funds for construction projects are disbursed as pre-specified stages of construction are completed. Regular site inspections are performed prior to advancing additional funds, at each construction phase, either by experienced construction lenders on staff or by independent outside inspection companies. Commercial construction loans generally are variable rate loans and lines with interest rates that are periodically adjusted and generally have terms of one to three years. 

&#160; 

From time to time, Enterprise participates with other banks in the financing of certain commercial projects. Participating loans with other institutions provide banks the opportunity to retain customer relationships, while providing them with larger credit vehicles than the individual bank might be willing or able to offer independently, while reducing credit risk exposure among each participating bank. In some cases, the Company may act as the lead lender, originating and servicing the loans, but participating out a portion of the funding to other banks. In other cases, the Company may participate in loans originated by other institutions. In each case, the participating bank funds a percentage of the loan commitment and takes on the related pro-rata risk. In each case in which the Company participates in a loan, the rights and obligations of each participating bank are divided proportionately among the participating banks in an amount equal to their share of ownership and with equal priority among all banks. The balances participated out to other institutions are not carried as assets on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Loans originated by other banks in which the Company is the participating institution are carried in the loan portfolio at the Company&#8217;s pro rata share of ownership. The Company performs an independent credit analysis of each commitment and a review of the participating institution prior to participation in the loan and an annual review thereafter of each participating institution. 

&#160; 

Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the financial obligation or performance by a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. If the letter of credit is drawn upon, a loan is created for the customer, generally a commercial loan, with the same criteria associated with similar commercial loans. 

&#160; 

Residential Loans 

&#160; 

Enterprise originates conventional mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential properties. These properties may serve as the borrower&#8217;s primary residence, vacation homes or investment properties. Loan-to-value limits vary, generally from 75% for multi-family owner-occupied properties, up to 97% for single family owner occupied properties, with mortgage insurance coverage required for loan-to-value ratios greater than 80% based on program parameters. In addition, financing is provided for the construction of owner occupied primary and secondary residences. Residential mortgage loans may have terms of up to 30 years at either fixed or adjustable rates of interest. Fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans are generally originated using secondary market underwriting and documentation standards. 

&#160; 

Depending on the current interest rate environment, management projections of future interest rates and the overall asset-liability management program of the Company, management may elect to sell those fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans which are eligible for sale in the secondary market, or hold some or all of this residential loan production for the Company&#8217;s portfolio. Mortgage loans are generally not pooled for sale, but instead, sold on an individual basis. Enterprise may retain or sell the servicing when selling the loans. Loans sold are subject to standard secondary market underwriting and eligibility representations and warranties over the life of the loan, and are subject to an early payment default period covering 

the first four payments for certain loan sales. Loans classified as held for sale are carried as a separate line item on the balance sheet. 

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit 

&#160; 

Home equity term loans are originated for one-to-four family residential properties with maximum combined loan-to-value ratios generally up to 80% of the assessed or appraised value of the property securing the loan. Home equity loan payments consist of monthly principal and interest based on amortization ranging from three to fifteen years. The rates may also be fixed for three to fifteen years. 

&#160; 

The Company originates home equity revolving lines of credit for one-to-four family residential properties with maximum combined loan to value ratios generally up to 80% of the assessed or appraised value of the property securing the loan. Home equity lines generally have interest rates that adjust monthly based on changes in the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, although minimum rates may be applicable. Some home equity line rates may be fixed for a period of time and then adjusted monthly thereafter. The payment schedule for home equity lines allows interest only payments for the first ten years of the lines. Generally, at the end of ten years, the line may be frozen to future advances, and principal plus interest payments are collected over a fifteen-year amortization schedule, or, for eligible borrowers meeting certain requirements, the line availability may be extended for an additional interest only period. 

&#160; 

Consumer Loans 

Consumer loans primarily consist of secured or unsecured personal loans, energy efficiency financing programs in conjunction with Massachusetts public utilities, and overdraft protection lines on checking accounts extended to individual customers. The aggregate amounts of overdrawn deposit accounts are reclassified as loan balances. 

Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses 

&#160; 

Information regarding the Company&#8217;s credit risk and allowance for loan losses is contained in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; contained in the section &#8220;Financial Condition,&#8221; under the headings &#8220;Credit Risk," "Asset Quality&#8221; and &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses,&#8221; and in the &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; section of Item 7 under the heading &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Deposit Products 

&#160; 

Deposits have traditionally been the principal source of the Company&#8217;s funds. Enterprise offers commercial checking, business and municipal savings accounts, term certificates of deposit (&#8220;CDs&#8221;), money market and business sweep accounts, Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts ("IOLTA's"), and escrow management accounts, as well as checking and Simplified Employee Pension (&#8220;SEP&#8221;) accounts to employees of our business customers. A broad selection of competitive retail deposit products are also offered, including personal checking accounts earning interest and/or reward points, savings accounts, money market accounts, individual retirement accounts (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) and CDs. Terms on CDs are offered ranging from one month to seventy-two months. As a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;), the Bank's depositors are provided deposit protection up to the maximum FDIC insurance coverage limits. 

&#160; 

In addition to the deposit products noted above, the Company also provides customers the ability to allocate money market and checking deposits and CDs to networks of reciprocating FDIC insured banks. Deposits are placed into nationwide networks in increments that are covered by FDIC insurance. This allows the Company to offer enhanced FDIC insurance coverage on larger deposit balances by placing the &#8220;excess&#8221; funds in FDIC insured accounts or term certificates issued by other banks participating in the networks. In exchange, the other institutions place dollar-for-dollar matching reciprocal and insurable deposits with the Company via the networks. Essentially, the equivalent of the original deposit comes back to the Company and is available to fund local loan growth. The original funds placed into the networks are not carried as deposits on the Company's balance sheet, however the network's reciprocal dollar deposits are carried as non-brokered deposits within the appropriate category under total deposits on the balance sheet. 

&#160; 

Management determines the interest rates offered on deposit accounts based on current and expected economic conditions, competition, liquidity needs, the volatility of existing deposits, the asset-liability position of the Company and the overall objectives of the Company regarding the growth and retention of relationships. 

&#160; 

Enterprise also utilizes brokered deposits, both term and overnight, from a number of available sources, as part of the Company's asset-liability management strategy and as an alternative to borrowed funds to support asset growth in excess of internally generated deposits. Brokered deposits along with borrowed funds may be referred to as wholesale funding. 

Cash Management Services 

In addition to the deposit products discussed above, commercial banking and municipal customers may take advantage of cash management services including remote deposit capture, Automated Clearing House ("ACH") credit and debit origination, credit card processing, wholesale and retail lockbox deposit, escrow management, Non-Sufficient Funds check recovery, coin and currency processing, check reconciliation, check payment fraud prevention, international and domestic wire transfers, corporate credit cards, and automated investment sweep of excess funds into enhanced FDIC insured money market and commercial checking accounts. 

Third-party money market mutual funds are also offered for commercial sweep accounts. Management believes that commercial customers benefit from this product flexibility, while retaining a conservative investment option of high quality and safety. The balances swept on a daily basis into mutual funds do not represent obligations of the Company and are not insured by the FDIC. 

Product Delivery Channels 

In addition to traditional product access channels, on-line banking customers may connect to their bank accounts securely via personal computer or any internet-enabled phone or mobile device. Various electronic banking capabilities include the following: account inquiries; viewing of recent transactions; account transfers; loan payments; bill payments; person to person payments; check deposits; placement of stop payments; access to images of checks paid; and access to prior period account statements; commercial customers can additionally launch cash management services such as remote deposit capture, check payment fraud prevention, conduct ACH transactions and initiate wire transfers. 

&#160; 

On-line and mobile banking tools utilize multiple layers of customer authentication including device and geographic recognition, personal access ID&#8217;s and passwords, as well as digital signatures for certain transactions. 

Personal and business debit card customers may also enlist in Apple Pay &#174; for their Apple &#174; compatible devices to conduct convenient contactless debit payments in a unique secure environment at hundreds of thousands of retail locations. 

Investment Services 

&#160; 

The Company provides a range of investment advisory and management services delivered via two channels, Enterprise Investment Advisors and Enterprise Investment Services. 

&#160; 

Investment advisory and management services include customized investment management and trust services provided under the label &#8220;Enterprise Investment Advisors&#8221; to individuals, family groups, commercial businesses, trusts, foundations, non-profit organizations, and endowments. 

&#160; 

Enterprise Investment Advisors primarily utilizes an open-architecture approach to client investment management. The philosophy is to identify and hire high performing mutual funds and independent investment management firms on behalf of our clients. The Company partners with an investment research and due diligence firm to strengthen strategic development, improve manager access and selection and provide performance monitoring capabilities. This firm performs detailed research and due diligence reviews and provides an objective analysis of each independent management firm based on historic returns, management quality, longevity, investment style, risk profile, and other criteria, and maintains ongoing oversight and monitoring of their performance. This due diligence is intended to enable the Company to customize investment portfolios to meet each customer&#8217;s financial objectives and deliver superior long-term performance. 

&#160; 

Enterprise Investment Advisors also offers the flexibility of an individually managed portfolio, for clients who prefer customized asset management with a variety of investment options, which includes our Large Cap Core Equity Strategy, a proprietary blend of value and growth stocks. Various secondary research sources are utilized with our individually managed portfolios. 

&#160; 

Enterprise Investment Services provides brokerage and management services through a third-party arrangement with Commonwealth Financial Network, a licensed securities brokerage firm, with products designed primarily for the individual investor. Retirement plan services are offered through third-party arrangements with leading 401(k) plan providers. 

&#160; 

Insurance Services 

&#160; 

Enterprise Insurance Services, LLC, engages in insurance sales activities through a third-party arrangement with HUB International New England, LLC (&#8220;HUB&#8221;), which is a full-service insurance agency, with offices in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and is part of HUB International Limited, which operates throughout the United States and Canada. Enterprise Insurance Services provides, through HUB, a full array of insurance products including property and casualty, employee benefits and risk-management solutions tailored to serve the specific insurance needs of businesses in a range of industries operating in the Company&#8217;s market area. 

Investment Activities 

&#160; 

The Company's investment portfolio activities are an integral part of the overall asset-liability management program of the Company. The investment function provides readily available funds to support loan growth, as well as to meet withdrawals and maturities of deposits, and attempts to provide maximum return consistent with liquidity constraints and general prudence, including diversification and safety of investments. 

&#160; 

The securities in which the Company may invest are limited by regulation. In addition, an internal investment policy restricts fixed income investments to high-quality securities within prescribed categories approved by the Asset-Liability Committee of the Board (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;). Management utilizes an outside registered investment adviser to manage the corporate and municipal bond portfolios within prescribed guidelines set by management. The Company&#8217;s internal investment policy also sets sector limits as a percentage of the total portfolio. The effect of changes in interest rates, market values, timing of principal payments and credit risk are considered when purchasing securities. 

&#160; 

Cash equivalents are defined as highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present insignificant risk of changes in value due to changes in interest rates. The Company's cash and cash equivalents may be comprised of cash and due from banks, interest-earning deposits (deposit accounts, excess cash balances, money market, money market mutual fund accounts and short-term U.S. Agency Discount Notes) and overnight and term federal funds sold ("fed funds") to money center banks. 

&#160; 

As of the balance sheet dates reflected in this annual report, all of the investment securities within the Company's investment portfolio were classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value. Management regularly reviews the portfolio for securities with unrealized losses that are other than temporarily impaired (&#8220;OTTI&#8221;). If a decline in the market value of an equity security or fund is considered other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security or fund is written down to market value with a charge to earnings. In the case of fixed income securities, the noncredit portion of the impairment may be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income with only the credit loss portion of the impairment charged to earnings. 

&#160; 

Investment transaction summaries, portfolio allocations and projected cash flows are prepared quarterly and presented to ALCO on a periodic basis. ALCO regularly reviews the composition and key risk characteristics of the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio, including effective duration, cash flow, and market value at risk and asset class concentration. Credit risk inherent in the portfolio is closely monitored by management and presented at least annually to ALCO. ALCO also designates acceptable and unacceptable investment practices, approves the selection of securities dealers, and the Company&#8217;s ongoing investment strategy. In March 2016, the ALCO Committee was merged into the full Board. The duties and responsibilities related to ALCO matters will be covered by the Board on a quarterly basis. 

The Company is required to purchase Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) stock in association with the Bank&#8217;s outstanding advances from the FHLB; this stock is classified as a restricted investment and carried at cost, which management believes approximates its fair value. 

&#160; 

See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A, and "Impairment Review of Investment Securities" contained under the heading "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," for further discussion on a variety of risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company&#8217;s investment portfolio. 

&#160; 

Other Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

As discussed above, deposit gathering has been the Company's principal source of funds. Asset growth in excess of deposits may be primarily funded through cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios, or the following sources: 

&#160; 

Borrowed Funds 

&#160; 

Total borrowing capacity includes borrowing arrangements at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) Discount Window, and borrowing arrangements with correspondent banks. 

&#160; 

Membership in the FHLB provides borrowing capacity based on qualifying collateral balances pre-pledged to the FHLB, including certain residential loans, home equity lines, commercial loans and U.S. Government and Agency securities. 

Borrowings from the FHLB typically are utilized to fund short-term liquidity needs or specific lending projects under the FHLB&#8217;s community development programs. This facility is an integral component of the Company&#8217;s asset-liability management program. 

&#160; 

The FRB Discount Window borrowing capacity is based on the pledge of qualifying collateral balances to the FRB. Collateral pledged for this FRB facility consists primarily of certain municipal and corporate securities held in the Company's investment portfolio. Additional types of collateral are available to increase borrowing capacity with the FRB if necessary. 

&#160; 

Pre-established non-collateralized overnight borrowing arrangements with large national and regional correspondent banks provide additional overnight and short-term borrowing capacity for the Company. 

See also &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A, for further discussion on a variety of risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain funding and sustain liquidity. 

&#160; 

Subordinated Debt 

&#160; 

The Company had outstanding subordinated debt of $14.8 million &#32;and $10.8 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , respectively. 

The subordinated debt carried at December 31, 2015 &#32;consisted of $15.0 million &#32;in aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the "Notes") issued in January 2015 , in a private placement to an accredited investor. The Notes, which are intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory purposes, mature on January 30, 2030 &#32;(the "Maturity Date") and are callable by the Company, subject to regulatory approval, at a premium beginning January 30, 2020 &#32;and at par beginning January 30, 2025 . The Notes pay interest at a fixed rate of 6.00% per annum through January 30, 2025 &#32;and beginning on January 31, 2025 &#32;through the Maturity Date, or any early redemption date, the interest rate on the Notes will adjust monthly at an interest rate of 3.90% &#32;plus 30-day LIBOR. Original debt issuance costs were $190 thousand &#32;and have been netted against the subordinated debt on the balance sheet in accordance with recent accounting guidance that the Company adopted in the first quarter of 2015. These costs are being amortized over the life of the Notes. 

The subordinated debt balance carried at December 31, 2014 &#32;consisted of $10.8 million &#32;in Junior Subordinated Debt Securities (the "Debt"), at a rate of 10.875% . In March 2015 , the Company paid off the Debt using proceeds from the $15.0 million &#32;in Notes issued in January 2015 . 

See also Note 7, "Borrowed Funds and Subordinated Debt&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 below, for further information regarding the Company&#8217;s subordinated debt. 

Capital Resources 

&#160; 

Capital planning by the Company and the Bank considers current needs and anticipated future growth. The primary sources of capital have been common stock issuances and proceeds from the issuance of subordinated debt. Ongoing sources of capital include the retention of earnings less dividends paid since the Bank commenced operations, proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from purchases of shares pursuant to the Company&#8217;s stockholder dividend reinvestment plan and direct stock purchase plan ("DRSPP"). 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , both the Company and the Bank qualified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under applicable regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;) and the FDIC effective as of December 31, 2015 . Although the Company believes its current capital is adequate to support ongoing operations and that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject, on July 18, 2013, the Company filed a shelf registration of common stock, rights or preferred stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the flexibility to raise, over a three year period, up to $40 million in capital to position the Company to take advantage of future growth and market share opportunities. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company has not utilized this shelf registration. 

&#160; 

See &#8220;Capital Requirements&#8221; below under the heading &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; for information regarding the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital requirements. 

Patents, Trademarks, etc. 

&#160; 

The Company holds a number of registered service marks and trademarks related to product names and corporate branding. The Company holds no other patents, registered trademarks, licenses (other than licenses required to be obtained from appropriate banking regulatory agencies), franchises or concessions that are material to its business. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company employed 426 full-time equivalent employees. None of the employees are presently represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes its employee relations are excellent. 

&#160; 

Company Website 

&#160; 

The Company currently uses outside vendors to design, support and host its two primary internet websites; www.enterprisebanking.com, for the Bank's products and services and Company information, as noted below; and www.enterpriseinvestmentadvisors.com, for Investment services. The underlying structure of the sites allows for the ongoing maintenance to be performed by third parties, and updates of the information to be performed by authorized Company personnel. 

The Bank's site provides information on the Company and its products and services. Users have the ability to open various deposit accounts as well as the ability to submit mortgage loan applications online and, via a link, to access their bank accounts and perform various financial transactions with those accounts using Online Banking. The site also provides the access point to a variety of specified banking services and information, various financial management tools, and investor and corporate information, which includes a corporate governance page. The Company&#8217;s corporate governance page includes the corporate governance guidelines, code of business conduct and ethics, and whistleblower and non-retaliation protection policy, as well as the charters of the Board of Directors&#8217; Audit, Compensation, and Corporate Governance/Nominating committees. 

&#160; 

In the Investor Relations section of the Bank's site, under the SEC Filings tab, the Company makes available copies of the Company&#8217;s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Additionally, the site includes all registration statements that the Company has been required to file in connection with the issuance of its shares. The Company similarly makes available all insider stock ownership and transaction reports filed with the SEC by executive officers, directors and any 10% or greater stockholders under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Forms 3, 4 and 5). Access to all of these reports is made available free of charge and is essentially simultaneous with the SEC&#8217;s posting of these reports on its EDGAR system through the SEC website (www.SEC.gov).

&#160; 

Enterprise faces robust competition to retain and attract customers within existing and neighboring geographic markets. This competition stems from national and larger regional banks, numerous local savings banks, commercial banks, cooperative banks and credit unions which have a presence in the region. Competition for loans, deposits and cash management services, investment advisory assets, and insurance business also comes from other businesses that provide financial services, including consumer finance companies, mortgage brokers and lenders, private lenders, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, institutional mutual funds, registered investment advisors, non-bank electronic payment and funding channels, internet based banks and other financial intermediaries. 

See also &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; below, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; and &#8220;Opportunities and Risks&#8221; included in the section entitled &#8220;Overview,&#8221; which is contained in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; for further discussion on how new laws and regulations and other factors may affect the Company&#8217;s competitive position, growth and/or profitability. 

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

Set forth below is a summary description of the significant elements of the laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are described. Moreover, these statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by the U.S. Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or its principal subsidiary, the Bank, could have a material effect on our business. 

Regulatory Agencies 

As a registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board and, acting under delegated authority, the FRB pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (the &#8220;Bank Holding Company Act&#8221;). 

As a Massachusetts state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Massachusetts Division of Banks and, with respect to the Bank's New Hampshire branching operations, the New Hampshire Banking Department. As a state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is also subject to the supervision and regulation of the FDIC. 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

As a registered bank holding company, the Company is required to furnish to the FRB annual and quarterly reports of its operations and may also be required to furnish such additional information and reports as the Federal Reserve Board or the FRB may require. 

Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies 

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board or, acting under delegated authority, the FRB before (1) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any class of voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after the acquisition, the Company would directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of the class; (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. The Company's acquisition of or merger with another bank holding company or acquisition of another bank would also require the prior approval of the Massachusetts Division of Banks. 

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, any company must obtain approval of the Federal Reserve Board or, acting under delegated authority, the FRB, prior to acquiring control of the Company or the Bank. For purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, &#8220;control&#8221; is defined as ownership of 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the Bank, the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors, or the exercise of a controlling influence over management or policies of the Company or the Bank. 

Control Acquisitions 

The Change in Bank Control Act, as amended (the &#8220;Change in Bank Control Act&#8221;), and the related regulations of the Federal Reserve Board require any person or groups of persons acting in concert (except for companies required to make application under the Bank Holding Company Act), to file a written notice with the Federal Reserve Board or, acting under delegated authority, the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank, before the person or group acquires control of the Company. The Change in Bank Control Act defines &#8220;control&#8221; as the direct or indirect power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities or to direct the management or policies of a bank holding company or an insured bank. A rebuttable presumption of control arises under the Change in Bank Control Act where a person or group controls 10% or more, but less than 25%, of a class of the voting stock of a company or insured bank which is a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 

amended, such as the Company, or such ownership interest is greater than the ownership interest held by any other person or group. 

In addition, the Change in Bank Control Act prohibits any entity from acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of a bank holding company&#8217;s or bank&#8217;s voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over a bank holding company or bank without the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. On September 22, 2008, the Federal Reserve Board issued a policy statement on equity investments in bank holding companies and banks, which allows the Federal Reserve Board to generally be able to conclude that an entity&#8217;s investment is not &#8220;controlling&#8221; if the investment in the form of voting and nonvoting shares represents in the aggregate (i) less than one-third of the total equity of the banking organization (and less than one-third of any class of voting securities, assuming conversion of all convertible nonvoting securities held by the entity) and (ii) less than 15% of any class of voting securities of the banking organization. 

Under the Change in Bank Control Act and applicable Massachusetts law, any person or group of persons acting in concert would also be required to file a written notice with the FDIC and the Massachusetts Division of Banks before acquiring any such direct or indirect control of the Bank. 

Permissible Activities 

The Bank Holding Company Act also limits the investments and activities of bank holding companies. In general, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, providing services for its subsidiaries, and various non-bank activities that are deemed to be closely related to banking. The activities of the Company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the Bank Holding Company Act and the implementing regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. 

In connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), the final Volcker Rule approved by regulators in December 2013 amended the Bank Holding Company Act to generally prohibit banking entities from engaging in the short-term proprietary trading of securities and derivatives for their own account and bar them from having certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. Included within the range of funds covered by the regulations are certain trust-preferred securities that back collateralized debt obligations. As the Company does not currently hold any of the prohibited investments, this aspect of the Volcker Rule does not have any impact on the Company&#8217;s financial statements at this time. 

A bank holding company may also elect to become a &#8220;financial holding company,&#8221; by which a qualified parent holding company of a banking institution may engage, directly or through its non-bank subsidiaries, in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or in any other activity that is complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. A bank holding company will be able to successfully elect to be regulated as a financial holding company if all of its depository institution subsidiaries meet certain prescribed standards pertaining to management, capital adequacy and compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act, as amended (the &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act&#8221;), such as being &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well-managed,&#8221; and must have a Community Reinvestment Act rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory.&#8221; Financial holding companies remain subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company believes that the Bank, which is the Company's sole depository institution subsidiary, presently satisfies all of the requirements that must be met to enable the Company to successfully elect to become a financial holding company. However, the Company has no current intention of seeking to become a financial holding company. Such a course of action may become necessary or appropriate at some time in the future depending upon the Company's strategic plan. 

Source of Strength 

Under the Federal Reserve Board's &#8220;source-of-strength&#8221; doctrine, a bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any of its subsidiary banks. The holding company is expected to commit resources to support a subsidiary bank, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide such support. A bank holding company's failure to meet its source-of-strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board's regulations, or both. The source-of-strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies in situations where the bank holding company's subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels. This doctrine was codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, but the Federal Reserve Board has not yet adopted regulations to implement this requirement. 

Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries 

Bank regulators are required to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions whose capital declines below certain levels. In the event an institution becomes &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company having control of the undercapitalized institution guarantees the subsidiary&#8217;s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution&#8217;s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy. 

The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5% of the institution&#8217;s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be &#8220;adequately capitalized.&#8221; The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes &#8220;significantly&#8221; or &#8220;critically&#8221; undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval of proposed dividends, or it may be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates. 

Safety and Soundness 

The Federal Reserve Board also has the power to order a bank holding company to terminate any activity or investment, or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary, when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or investment or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of any subsidiary bank of the bank holding company. 

Bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsound banking practices. For example, the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation Y requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities, if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the bank holding company's consolidated net worth. There is an exception for bank holding companies that are well-managed, well-capitalized, and not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation. As another example, a holding company could not impair its subsidiary bank's soundness by causing it to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve Board believed it not prudent to do so. 

The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations. The Federal Reserve Board can assess civil money penalties for activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis, if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. The penalties can be as high as $1 million for each day the activity continues. 

Capital Requirements 

The federal banking agencies have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks that are expected to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization's operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. The risk&#8209;based guidelines apply on a consolidated basis to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more. 

Pursuant to federal regulations, banks and bank holding companies must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed, including the volume and severity of problem loans. The federal banking agencies may change existing capital guidelines or adopt new capital guidelines in the future and have required many banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized, in which case the affected institution may no longer be deemed well capitalized and may be subject to restrictions on various activities, including a bank's ability to accept or renew brokered deposits. 

Under these capital guidelines, a banking organization is required to maintain certain minimum capital ratios, which are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. In general, the dollar 

amounts of assets and certain off-balance sheet items are &#8220;risk-adjusted&#8221; and assigned to various risk categories. In addition to such risk adjusted capital requirements, banking organizations are also required to maintain an additional minimum &#8220;leverage&#8221; capital ratio, which is calculated on the basis of average total assets without any adjustment for risk being made to the value of the assets. 

Qualifying capital is classified depending on the type of capital as follows: 

&#8220;Tier 1 capital&#8221; consists of common equity, retained earnings, qualifying non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. In determining bank holding company compliance with holding company level capital requirements, qualifying Tier 1 capital may count trust preferred securities, subject to certain criteria and quantitative limits for inclusion of restricted core capital elements in Tier 1 capital, provided that the bank holding company has total assets of less than $15 billion and such trust preferred securities were issued before May 19, 2010; 

&#8220;Tier 2 capital&#8221; includes, among other things, hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, qualifying term subordinated debt, preferred stock that does not qualify as Tier 1 capital, and a limited amount of allowance for loan and lease losses. 

Under the federal capital guidelines as of December 31, 2014, there were three fundamental capital ratios: a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be deemed &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the prompt corrective action framework, a bank holding company must have had a total risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and 6%, respectively, and a bank must have had a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 10%, 6% and 5%, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the respective capital ratios of both the Company and the Bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under then applicable Federal Reserve Board and FDIC capital rules. 

Under the Basel III Rules, effective January 1, 2015, a bank holding company must satisfy increased capital levels in order to comply with the prompt corrective action framework and to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments once the rule is fully phased in. See &#8220;Capital Requirements under Basel III&#8221; below. 

Capital Requirements under Basel III 

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, and on July 9, 2013, the FDIC and OCC, adopted a final rule that implements the Basel III changes to the international regulatory capital framework, referred to as the &#8220;Basel III Rules.&#8221; The Basel III Rules apply to both depository institutions and (subject to certain exceptions not applicable to the Company) their holding companies. Although parts of the Basel III Rules apply only to large, complex financial institutions, substantial portions of the Basel III Rules apply to the Company and the Bank. The Basel III Rules include requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010. 

The Basel III Rules include higher risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements and redefine what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for purposes of calculating those ratios. Among the most important changes are stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments that would disallow the inclusion of instruments, such as trust preferred securities (other than grandfathered trust preferred securities), in Tier 1 capital going forward and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. 

The Basel III Rules also introduced a common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) risk-based capital ratio. CET1 capital consists of retained earnings and common stock instruments, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, the rule requires that most regulatory capital deductions be made from CET1 capital. 

The Basel III Rules also establish a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on certain activities including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers if its capital level is below the buffered ratio. 

The Basel III Rules generally became effective January 1, 2015. The conservation buffer will be phased in beginning in 2016 and will take full effect on January 1, 2019. The Basel III minimum capital ratio requirements as applicable to the Company and the Bank in 2019 after the full phase-in period are summarized in the table below.

The Basel III Rules also revise the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including our subsidiary bank, if their capital levels do not meet certain thresholds. These revisions became effective January 1, 2015. The prompt correction action rules now include a CET1 capital component and increase certain other capital requirements for the various thresholds. As of January 1, 2015, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following capital levels in order to qualify as &#8220;well capitalized:&#8221; (i) a Total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules); (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (iii) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5%. Accordingly, a financial institution may be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the prompt corrective action framework, but not satisfy the fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios. The Company&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios and those of the Bank were in excess of the levels established for &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institutions under the Basel III Rules as of December 31, 2015. 

The Federal Reserve Board may also set higher capital requirements for holding companies whose circumstances warrant it. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. The bank regulatory agencies could impose higher capital requirements to meet &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; standards and any future regulatory change could impose higher capital standards as a routine matter. 

The Basel III Rules set forth certain changes in the methods of calculating certain risk-weighted assets, which in turn will affect the calculation of risk-based ratios. Under the Basel III Rules, higher or more sensitive risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, including, certain credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credits that are 90 days past due or on non-accrual, foreign exposures and certain corporate exposures. In addition, these rules include greater recognition of collateral and guarantees, and revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions. 

In addition, the Basel III Rules include certain exemptions to address concerns about the regulatory burden on community banks. For example, banking organizations with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 are permitted to include in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued and included in Tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010 on a permanent basis, without any phase out. Community banks may also elect on a one time basis in their March 31, 2015 quarterly filings to permanently opt-out of the requirement to include most accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) components in the calculation of CET1 capital and, in effect, retain the AOCI treatment under the current capital rules. Under the Basel III Rules, in 2015 the Company made such election to permanently exclude AOCI from capital. 

Overall, the Basel III Rules provide some important concessions for smaller, less complex financial institutions, such as the Company. 

Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends 

The Company is regarded as a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The principal source of the Company&#8217;s revenues is dividends received from the Bank. Both Massachusetts and federal law limit the payment of dividends by the Company. Under Massachusetts law, the Company is generally prohibited from paying a dividend or making any other distribution if, after making such distribution, it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of 

business, or if its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if it were dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy any preferential rights on dissolution of holders of preferred stock ranking senior in right of payment to the capital stock on which the applicable distribution is made. The Federal Reserve Board also has further authority to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement and supervisory guidance on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that, (1) the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to cover the cash dividends, (2) the rate of earnings retention is consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition, and (3) the minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios are met. It is also the Federal Reserve Board's policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to serve as a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries. 

Bank Regulation 

The Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Massachusetts Division of Banks and the FDIC, and, with respect to its New Hampshire branching operations, of the New Hampshire Banking Department. Federal and Massachusetts laws and regulations that specifically apply to the Bank's business and operations cover, among other matters, the scope of its business, the nature of its investments, its reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, its activities relating to dividends, investments, loans, the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, branching, and mergers and acquisitions. The Bank is also subject to federal and state laws and regulations that restrict or limit loans or extensions of credit to, or other transactions with, &#8220;insiders,&#8221; including officers, directors and principal stockholders, and loans or extension of credit by banks to affiliates or purchases of assets from, or other transactions with, affiliates, including parent holding companies. 

The FDIC and the Massachusetts Division of Banks may exercise extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. If as a result of an examination, the Massachusetts Division of Banks or the FDIC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank's operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the Massachusetts Division of Banks and the FDIC have authority to undertake a variety of enforcement measures of varying degrees of severity, including the following: 

&#8226; 

Requiring the Bank to take affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; 

&#8226; 

Directing the Bank to increase capital and maintain higher specific minimum capital ratios, which may preclude the Bank from being deemed to be well capitalized and restrict its ability to engage in various activities; 

&#8226; 

Restricting the Bank's growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

Requiring the Bank to enter into an informal or formal enforcement action to take corrective measures and cease unsafe and unsound practices, including requesting the board of directors to adopt a binding resolution, sign a memorandum of understanding or enter into consent order; 

&#8226; 

Requiring prior approval for any changes in senior management or the board of directors; 

&#8226; 

Removing officers and directors and assessing civil monetary penalties; and 

&#8226; 

Taking possession of, closing and liquidating the Bank or appointing the FDIC as receiver under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

Permissible Activities 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;), and applicable Massachusetts law, the Bank may generally engage in any activity that is permissible under Massachusetts law and either is permissible for national banks or the FDIC has determined does not pose a significant risk to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). In addition, the Bank may also form, subject to the approvals of the Massachusetts Division of Banks and the FDIC, &#8220;financial subsidiaries&#8221; to engage in any activity that is financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. In order to qualify for the authority to form a financial subsidiary, the Bank is required to satisfy certain conditions, some of which are substantially similar to those that the Company would be required to satisfy in order to elect to become a financial holding company. The Company believes that the Bank would be able to satisfy all of the conditions that would be required to form a financial subsidiary, although the Bank has no current intention of doing so. Such a course of action may become necessary or appropriate at some time in the future depending upon the Bank's strategic plan. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

The FDIC monitors the capital adequacy of the Bank by using a combination of risk-based guidelines and leverage ratios. The FDIC considers the Bank&#8217;s capital levels when taking action on various types of applications and when conducting supervisory activities related to the safety and soundness of the Bank and the banking system. Under the capital rules which became effective on January 1, 2015, banks are required to maintain four minimum capital standards: (1) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets ratio, or &#8220;leverage capital ratio,&#8221; of at least 4.0%, (2) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, or &#8220;Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio,&#8221; of at least 6.0%, (3) a total risk-based capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets ratio, or &#8220;total risk-based capital ratio,&#8221; of at least 8.0%, and (4) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%. In addition, the FDIC&#8217;s prompt corrective action standards discussed below, in effect, increase the minimum regulatory capital ratios for banking organizations. These capital requirements are minimum requirements. Higher capital levels may be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual institutions, or if required by the banking regulators due to the economic conditions impacting our market. For example, FDIC regulations provide that higher capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk and the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

The federal banking agencies have issued regulations pursuant to the FDIA defining five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. A bank that may otherwise meet the minimum requirements to be classified as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated instead as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, a bank that is deemed to be undercapitalized or in a lesser capital category will be required to submit to its primary federal banking regulator a capital restoration plan and to comply with the plan. 

Any bank holding company that controls a subsidiary bank that has been required to submit a capital restoration plan will be required to provide assurances of compliance by the bank with the capital restoration plan, subject to limitations on the bank holding company's aggregate liability in connection with providing such required assurances. Failure to restore capital under a capital restoration plan can result in the bank being placed into receivership if it becomes critically undercapitalized. A bank subject to prompt corrective action also may affect its parent holding company in other ways. These include possible restrictions or prohibitions on dividends or subordinated debt payments to the parent holding company by the bank, as well as limitations on other transactions between the bank and the parent holding company. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board may impose restrictions on the ability of the bank holding company itself to pay dividends, or require divestiture of holding company affiliates that pose a significant risk to the subsidiary bank, or require divestiture of the undercapitalized subsidiary bank. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank may be subject to increased operating restrictions by its primary federal banking regulator. 

Branching 

Massachusetts law provides that a Massachusetts banking company can establish a branch anywhere in Massachusetts provided that the branch is approved in advance by the Massachusetts Division of Banks and the FDIC, who consider a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. The Bank also may establish branches in any other state if that state would permit the establishment of a branch by a state bank chartered in that state, which also requires the approval of the Massachusetts Division of Banks, the FDIC and potentially the banking authority of the state into which the Bank intends to branch. 

Deposit Insurance 

The FDIC insures the deposits of federally insured banks, such as the Bank, and thrifts, up to prescribed statutory limits for each depositor, through the DIF and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and thrift industries. The Dodd-Frank Act set the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each insured depository institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. 

The Bank is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. In connection with the Dodd Frank Act's requirement that insurance assessments be based on assets, the FDIC redefined its deposit insurance premium assessment base to be an institution's average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and revised its deposit insurance assessment rate schedule in light of this change to the assessment base. 

At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking, if required. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines to increase assessment rates, the Bank may be required to pay higher FDIC insurance premiums. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on the Company's earnings. 

In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;), an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. These assessments, which are included in Deposit Insurance Premiums on the Consolidated Statements of Income, will continue until the FICO bonds mature between 2017 and 2019. 

Restrictions on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions 

The Company's ability to pay dividends on its shares depends primarily on dividends it receives from the Bank. Both Massachusetts and federal law limit the payment of dividends by the Bank. Under FDIC regulations and applicable Massachusetts law, the dollar amount of dividends and any other capital distributions that the Bank may make depends upon its capital position and recent net income. Generally, so long as the Bank remains adequately capitalized, it may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to 100% of net income for the year to date plus retained net income for the two preceding years. However, if the Bank's capital becomes impaired or the FDIC or Massachusetts Division of Banks otherwise determines that the Bank is in need of more than normal supervision, the Bank may be prohibited or otherwise limited from paying any dividends or making any other capital distributions. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and the regulations issued thereunder (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;) are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their entire assessment area, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operations of such banks. The CRA requires the FDIC and the Massachusetts Division of Banks evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting such credit needs. The CRA evaluation is also considered by the bank regulatory agencies in evaluating approvals for mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. Failure to adequately meet the criteria within CRA guidelines could impose additional requirements and limitations on the Bank. Additionally, the Bank must publicly disclose the ability to request the Bank&#8217;s CRA Performance Evaluation and other various related documents. The Bank received a rating of &#8220;High Satisfactory&#8221; by the Massachusetts Division of Banks and &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; by the FDIC on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination. 

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Loans to Insiders 

Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are subject to the provisions of Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (the &#8220;Affiliates Act&#8221;), as such provisions are made applicable to state non-member banks by Section 18(i) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank's holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. 

These provisions place limits on the amount of: 

&#8226; 

loans or extensions of credit to affiliates; 

&#8226; 

investment in affiliates; 

&#8226; 

assets that may be purchased from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve Board; 

&#8226; 

the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates; and 

&#8226; 

the guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. 

The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of the Bank's capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of its capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements and the types of permissible collateral may be limited. The Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the purchase or acquisition of low-quality assets from affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of Section 23A, which now includes investment funds managed by an institution as an affiliate, as well as other procedural and substantive hurdles. 

The Bank is also subject to Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which, among other things, prohibits the Bank from engaging in any transaction with an affiliate unless the transaction is on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. The Federal Reserve Board has also issued Regulation W which codifies prior regulations under the Affiliates Act and interpretive guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. 

Under both Massachusetts and federal law, the Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded coverage of transactions with insiders by including credit exposure arising from derivative transactions (which are also covered by the expansion of Section 23A). The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing or selling an asset to an executive officer, director, or principal stockholder (or any related interest of such a person) unless the transaction is on market terms, and, if the transaction exceeds 10% of the institution's capital, it is approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested directors. 

Concentrated Commercial Real Estate Lending Regulations 

The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending if (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm nonresidential properties (excluding loans secured by owner-occupied properties) and loans for construction, land development, and other land represent 300% or more of total capital and the bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices that address the following key elements: including board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a &#8220;Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending&#8221; reminding banks of the need to engage in risk management practices for commercial real estate lending. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank's construction and land development concentration level exceed the 100% threshold levels noted above. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act has implemented significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry and includes the following provisions that have affected or are likely to affect the Company: 

&#8226; 

Repeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits effective July 21, 2011, thereby permitting, but not requiring, depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. 

&#8226; 

Imposition of comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, including provisions that effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives activities from within the institution. 

&#8226; 

Implementation of corporate governance revisions, including proxy access requirements for all publicly traded companies. 

&#8226; 

Increase in the Federal Reserve Board's examination authority with respect to bank holding companies' non-banking subsidiaries. 

&#8226; 

Limitations on the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer effective July 21, 2011. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board set the interchange rate cap at $0.24 per transaction. While these restrictions do not apply to banks like Enterprise with less than $10 billion in assets, the rule could affect the competitiveness of debit cards issued by smaller banks. We believe that market forces may erode the effectiveness of this exemption now that merchants can select more than one network for transaction routing. 

&#8226; 

Significant increases in the regulation of mortgage lending and servicing by banks and nonbanks. In particular, requirements that mortgage originators act in the best interests of a consumer and seek to ensure that a consumer will have the capacity to repay a loan that the consumer enters into; requirements that mortgage originators be properly qualified, registered, and licensed and comply with any regulations designed by the Federal Reserve Board to monitor their operations; mandates of comprehensive additional and enhanced residential mortgage loan related disclosures, both prior to loan origination and after; mandates of additional appraisal practices for loans secured by residential dwellings, including potential additional appraisals at the banks cost; mandates of additional collection and reporting requirements on transactions that are reportable under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act; additional restrictions on the compensation of loan originators; and requirements that mortgage loan securitizers retain a certain amount of risk (as established by the regulatory agencies). However, mortgages that conform to the new regulatory standards as "qualified residential mortgages" will not be subject to risk retention requirements. 

Although the majority of the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s rulemaking requirements have been met with finalized rules, approximately one-third of the rulemaking requirements are either still in the proposal stage or have not yet been proposed. Accordingly, it is difficult to anticipate the continued impact this expansive legislation will have on the Company, its customers and the financial industry generally. 

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and thrifts, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in Lending Act (&#8220;TILA&#8221;), Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#8220;RESPA&#8221;), Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. Banking institutions with total assets of $10 billion or less, such as the Bank, remain subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws and such additional regulations as may be adopted by the CFPB. 

On January 10, 2013, the CFPB released its final &#8220;Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage&#8221; rules, which amended TILA&#8217;s implementing regulation, Regulation Z. Regulation Z currently prohibits a creditor from making a higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer's ability to repay the loan. The final rule implements sections 1411 and 1412 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which generally require creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open-end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan) and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; The final rule also implements section 1414 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limits prepayment penalties. Finally, the final rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated. This rule became effective January 10, 2014. The CFPB allowed for a small creditor exemption for banks with assets under $2 billion and that 

originate less than 500 mortgage loans in 2015. Beginning January 1, 2016, the small creditor exemption will be allowed for banks with assets under $2 billion and that originate less than 2,000 mortgage loans. 

On November 20, 2013, pursuant to section 1032(f) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued the Know Before You Owe TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule (&#8220;TRID&#8221;), which combined the disclosures required under TILA and sections 4 and 5 of RESPA, into a single, integrated disclosure for mortgage loan transactions covered by those laws. TRID, which requires the use of a Loan Estimate that must be delivered or placed in the mail no later than the third business day after receiving the consumer&#8217;s application and a Closing Disclosure that must be provided to the consumer at least three business days prior to consummation, became effective for applications received on or after October 3, 2015 for applicable closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. Creditors must only use the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure forms for mortgage loan transactions subject to TRID. All other mortgage loan transactions continue to use the Good Faith Estimate and the Initial Truth-in-Lending Disclosure at application and the HUD-1 Settlement Statement and the Final Truth-in-Lending Disclosure at closing. TRID also has changed the scope of transactions applicable, and adjusted the tolerance requirements and record retention requirements. Of note, the creditor must retain evidence of compliance with the Loan Estimate requirements, including providing the Loan Estimate, and the Closing Disclosure requirements for three years after the later of the date of consummation, the date disclosures are required to be made or the date the action is required to be taken. Additionally, the creditor must retain copies of the Closing Disclosure, including all documents related to the Closing Disclosure, for five years after consummation. 

UDAP and UDAAP 

Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address &#8220;unethical&#8221; or otherwise &#8220;bad&#8221; business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, referred to as the FTC Act, which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as UDAP, and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. &#8220;Unjustified consumer injury&#8221; is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,&#8221; referred to as UDAAP, which have been delegated to the CFPB for rule-making. The federal banking agencies have the authority to enforce such rules and regulations. 

Incentive Compensation 

In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. 

The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years and on so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by stockholders. The Dodd-Frank Act also directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1 billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters. 

Technology Risk Management and Consumer Privacy 

State and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of depository institutions with respect to banks that contract with third-party vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions. The use of technology-related products, services, delivery channels and processes exposes a bank to various risks, particularly operational, privacy, security, strategic, reputation and compliance risk. Banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology. 

Under Section 501 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer. Among other matters, the rules require each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. 

Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices. Section 502 prohibits a financial institution from disclosing nonpublic personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt-out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure. Under Section 504, the agencies are authorized to issue regulations as necessary to implement notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution's ability to disclose nonpublic personal information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties. Under the final rule the regulators adopted, all banks must develop initial and annual privacy notices which describe in general terms the bank's information sharing practices. Banks that share nonpublic personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt-out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure (with certain exceptions). Limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card, deposit or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third-party for use in marketing. 

Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer 

Our Company and the Bank are also subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives the federal government powers to address money laundering and terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, and mandatory transaction reporting obligations. The Bank Secrecy Act imposes an affirmative obligation on the Bank to report currency transactions that exceed certain thresholds and to report other transactions determined to be suspicious. The Bank Secrecy Act requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions. These programs must, at a minimum, provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance, provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance, designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training. 

USA Patriot Act 

Under the USA Patriot Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards intended to detect, and prevent, the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The USA Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum standards specified by the act, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has proposed new regulations that would require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information for certain accounts, however, it has yet to establish final regulations on this topic. 

Other Operations and Consumer Compliance Laws 

The Bank must comply with numerous federal anti-money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implement regulations, including but not limited to the Truth in Savings Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Expedited Funds Availability 

Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Federal Housing Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and various other federal and state privacy protection laws. Failure to comply in any material respect with any of these laws could subject the Bank to lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including fines and reimbursements. The Company and the Bank are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply in any material respect with any of these laws and regulations could subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

See also Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; and &#8220;Opportunities and Risks&#8221; included in the section entitled &#8220;Overview,&#8221; which is contained in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; for further discussion on how new laws and regulations may affect the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.
