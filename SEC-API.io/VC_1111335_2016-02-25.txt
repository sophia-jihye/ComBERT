Description of Business 

Visteon Corporation (the "Company" or "Visteon") is a global automotive supplier that designs, engineers and manufactures innovative electronics products for nearly every original equipment vehicle manufacturer ("OEM") worldwide including Ford, Nissan, Renault, Mazda, BMW, General Motors and Honda. Visteon is headquartered in Van Buren Township, Michigan and has an international network of manufacturing operations, technical centers and joint venture operations, supported by approximately 11,000 &#32;employees, dedicated to the design, development, manufacture and support of its product offerings and its global customers. The Company's manufacturing and engineering footprint is principally located outside of the U.S., with a heavy concentration in low-cost geographic regions. 

Visteon provides value for its customers and stockholders through its technology-focused vehicle cockpit electronics business, by delivering a rich, connected cockpit experience for every car from luxury to entry. The Company's cockpit electronics business is one of the broadest portfolios in the industry and includes audio systems, information displays, instrument clusters, head up displays, infotainment systems, and telematics solutions. The Company's cockpit electronics business comprises and is reported under the Electronics segment. In addition to the Electronics segment, the Company has residual operations in South America and Europe previously associated with the Interiors and Climate businesses but not subject to discontinued operations classification that comprise Other. 

The pie charts below highlight the sales breakdown for Visteon's Electronics segment for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Company&#8217;s History 

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in January 2000 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company (&#8220;Ford&#8221; or &#8220;Ford Motor Company&#8221;). Subsequently, Ford transferred the assets and liabilities comprising its automotive components and systems business to Visteon. The Company separated from Ford on June 28, 2000 when all of the Company&#8217;s common stock was distributed by Ford to its shareholders. 

During the latter part of 2008 and through 2009, weakened economic conditions, largely attributable to the global credit crisis, and erosion of consumer confidence, triggered a global economic recession that negatively impacted the automotive sector. On May 28, 2009, the Company and many of its domestic subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in response to the resulting sudden and severe declines in global automotive production and the related adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s cash flows and liquidity. On August 31, 2010, the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization and the Company emerged from bankruptcy on October 1, 2010. 

In September 2012, the Company announced a comprehensive shareholder value creation plan founded on the pillars of industrial logic, customer focus and financial discipline. The primary objectives of the comprehensive shareholder value creation plan included the following: 

&#8226; 

Interiors Exit - During 2009 the Company exited its Interiors businesses in North America leaving a solid and capable regional business, but one without a complete global footprint. Subsequently, the Company determined that the remainder of its Interiors business was not aligned with its long-term strategic goals and set out to explore various alternatives for exit including, but not limited to, divestiture, partnership or alliance. 

&#8226; 

Climate Consolidation - Historically, the Company's Climate operations were comprised of Halla Climate Control Corporation ("Halla"), a 70% owned and consolidated Korean subsidiary, and a series of wholly-owned Visteon Climate operations and other Visteon Climate joint ventures. To enhance the efficiency of its investments in global Climate assets, the Company endeavored to consolidate the ownership of its Climate businesses under a single ownership structure thus achieving operational synergies, improved global scale and common business practices. 

&#8226; 

Electronics Optimization - Historically, the Company's investment in its Electronics business was sub-optimized. The Company focused its strategy on vehicle cockpit electronics and commenced efforts to expand the size and scale of its capabilities to deliver innovative audio, infotainment, cluster and display products to OEM customers and to position the business to capitalize on rapidly changing consumer-driven technologies in a connected car landscape. 

&#8226; 

Strengthen the Balance Sheet - Following emergence from bankruptcy, the Company's balance sheet continued to carry a significant amount of indebtedness, including substantial employee retirement benefit obligations. Servicing these debts and reducing the associated carrying costs and economic risks were identified as priorities. 

&#8226; 

Enhance Shareholder Returns - The Company also declared its intent to make shareholder returns a priority. 

Interiors Exit 

In May 2014 Visteon reached an agreement to divest substantially all of its global Interiors business (the "Interiors Divestiture") pursuant to a Master Purchase Agreement, as subsequently amended (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;). Effective November 1, 2014, the Company closed on the majority of the Interiors Divestiture (the "Master Closing"). Subsequent to the Master Closing, Visteon completed the sale of interiors operations in India and Thailand on December 1, 2014 and February 2, 2015, respectively. Remaining interiors operations subject to the Interiors Divestiture, which are located in Argentina and Brazil, are expected to close in 2016. 

In June 2015, the Company completed the sale of its 12.5% ownership interest in Yangfeng Visteon Jinqiao Automotive Trim Systems Co., Ltd., a Chinese automotive supplier for proceeds of approximately $91 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $62 million. The sale of this joint venture is a final step of the Company's 2013 Master Agreement (the &#8220;Master Agreement&#8221;) with Huayu Automotive Systems Company Limited (&#8220;HASCO&#8221;), Yanfeng Visteon Automotive Trim Systems Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Yanfeng&#8221;) and Yanfeng Visteon Automotive Electronics Co., Ltd. (&#8220;YFVE&#8221;) to sell its ownership in interiors related joint ventures, the vast majority of which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2013. 

On December 1, 2015, Visteon completed the sale and transfer of its equity ownership in Visteon Deutschland GmbH, which operated the Berlin, Germany interiors plant ("Germany Interiors Divestiture") . The Company contributed cash of approximately $141 million, assets of $27 million, and liabilities of $198 million, including pension related liabilities. The Company will make a final contribution payment of approximately $30 million by November 2016 included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as "Other current liabilities" as of December 31, 2015. The Company recognized a pre-tax loss on divestiture of $105 million related to foreign currency translation and pension benefit plan amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 

Climate Consolidation and Sale 

During 2013, the ownership structure of Visteon&#8217;s thermal energy management businesses was changed in connection with the sale of certain of Visteon climate subsidiaries, joint venture investments and related intellectual properties to Halla (&#8220;Climate Consolidation&#8221;). With effect from February 1, 2013, the climate business as combined under Halla operated as Halla Visteon Climate Control Corporation, a Korean corporation (&#8220;HVCC&#8221;). Visteon held an approximate 70% controlling ownership interest in HVCC, headquartered in South Korea. The Climate Consolidation qualified as a common control transaction. 

On June 9, 2015, Visteon completed the sale to Hahn &#38; Co. Auto Holdings Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Hahn&#8221;) and Hankook Tire Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Hankook&#8221; and, together with Hahn, the &#8220;Purchasers&#8221;) of all of its shares of HVCC, for approximately $3.4 billion , or KRW 52,000 &#32;per share after adjusting for the 2014 dividend paid by HVCC to Visteon (the &#8220;Climate Transaction&#8221;), pursuant to and in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement, dated as of December 17, 2014 (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;), among Visteon and the Purchasers. The Company received net cash proceeds of approximately $2.7 billion &#32;and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $2.3 billion &#32;in connection with the closing of the Climate Transaction in June, 2015. 

Electronics Optimization 

On November 7, 2013 and in connection with the Yanfeng Transactions, Visteon made a cash payment of $58 &#32;million to subscribe to an additional 11% &#32;ownership interest in YFVE. This step acquisition increased Visteon's direct ownership interest in YFVE from a non-controlling 40% &#32;direct ownership interest to a controlling 51% &#32;direct ownership interest. 

Effective July 1, 2014 Visteon acquired substantially all of the global automotive electronics business of Johnson Controls Inc. for the aggregate purchase price of $299 &#32;million funded with cash on hand, including $31 million of cash and equivalents at the acquired business (the "Electronics Acquisition"). The Electronics Acquisition is expected to enhance Visteon's competitive position in the fast-growing vehicle cockpit electronics segment by strengthening its global scale, manufacturing and engineering footprint, product portfolio and customer penetration. Sales for the acquired business were approximately $1.3 billion for the annual period ended September 30, 2013. 

On January 12, 2016, Visteon entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire all shares of AllGo Systems, Inc., USA ("AllGo Systems") for initial consideration of $15 million and contingent consideration of $7 million, expected to close during the first half of 2016. AllGo Systems, is a leading developer of embedded multimedia system solutions to global vehicle manufacturers. The acquisition further strengthens the Company's technological capabilities as it develops the next generation infotainment products. 

Strengthen the Balance Sheet 

During 2012 the Company offered an accelerated pension payment program to most of its U.S. deferred vested defined benefit plan participants, whereby such participants could elect to receive a single lump sum payout. Approximately 70% of eligible participants elected to receive a single lump sum payout resulting in a reduction of the Company's U.S. retirement plan obligations of $408 million and a reduction in plan assets of $301 million, respectively. 

On July 16, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to transfer approximately $350 million of U.S. pension assets to Prudential Insurance Company of America, to settle approximately $350 million of its U.S. outstanding pension obligation. As a result, the Company substantially lowered the related economic volatility associated with the pension obligation. 

On June 12, 2015 , the Company utilized Climate Transaction proceeds to pay down $246 million &#32;of term loan principal on June 12, 2015 &#32;to reduce aggregate principal amount of Term Loans outstanding to $350 million . 

Enhance Shareholder Returns 

In July 2012, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million &#32;of the Company's common stock. During 2012, the Company repurchased 1,005,559 &#32;shares of its outstanding common stock at an weighted average price of $49.72 &#32;per share, excluding commissions, for the aggregate purchase price of $50 million . In January 2013, the board of directors authorized an increase of share repurchase amount by an additional $200 million &#32;and brought the total share repurchase authorization to $300 million . In March 2013, the Company entered into an accelerated stock buyback ("ASB") program with a third-party financial institution to purchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $125 million . The program concluded in April 2013 and the Company received 2,209,078 &#32;shares in total. The final settlement price for all shares delivered under the program was $56.58 . 

In August 2013, the Company's board of directors raised the authorization of its remaining share repurchase program from $125 million &#32;to $1 billion &#32;over the next two years. The Company entered into another ASB program in August 2013 with a third-party financial institution to purchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $125 million . This program concluded in December 2013 and the Company received 1,676,900 &#32;shares in total. The final settlement price for all shares delivered under the program was $74.54 . 

In May 2014, the Company announced another ASB program with a third-party financial institution to purchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million . Under the program, the Company paid the financial institution $500 million &#32;and received an initial delivery of 3,394,157 &#32;shares of common stock using a reference price of $92.07 , and an additional delivery of 1,129,001 &#32;shares of common stock following the conclusion of the hedge period which determined a certain minimum amount of shares guaranteed under a portion of the program that had a maximum per share price of $100.54 . On October 15, 2014, the capped portion of the program concluded, and the Company received an additional 112,269 &#32;shares. The final settlement price for all shares delivered under the capped portion of the program was $96.19 . On May 1, 2015, the uncapped portion of the program concluded, and the Company received an additional 534,214 shares. The final settlement price for all shares delivered under the uncapped portion of the program was $97.25. 

On June 11, 2015, the Company's board of directors authorized an additional $125 million &#32;of share repurchase for a total of $500 million &#32;available for share repurchase. On June 15, 2015, the Company entered into another ASB program with a third-party financial institution to purchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $500 million . Under the program, the Company paid the financial institution $500 million &#32;and received an initial delivery of 3,712,297 &#32;shares of common stock, which 

is approximately 80% &#32;of the total number of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock expected to be repurchased under the ASB Agreement based on the closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on June 15, 2015. In December 2015, the program concluded and the Company received an additional 1,058,965 shares. The final settlement price for all shares delivered under this 2015 ASB program was $104.79. 

On December 9, 2015, the Company&#8217;s board of directors approved a special distribution of $43.40 per share of its common stock outstanding as of January 15, 2016, or approximately $1.75 billion in the aggregate, payable on January 22, 2016, and authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $500 million of its shares of common stock through December 31, 2016. 

On December 16, 2015, the Company entered into a stock repurchase agreement with a third party financial institution to purchase shares of its common stock complying with the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&#8220;10b5-1 Share Repurchase Program&#8221;). The new 10b5-1 Share Repurchase Program is open until March 1, 2016 with the maximum purchase amount of $150 million, net of commissions. Under this program, the third-party financial institution will repurchase the Company&#8217;s shares at the prevailing market prices pursuant to specified share price and daily volume limits. As of February 19, 2016, the Company has paid $84 million to repurchase 1,307,500 of shares at an average price of $64.06. 

Approximately $1.74 billion of the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments, including separately managed accounts, have been liquidated on or about January 19, 2016 to fund the special distribution paid on January 22, 2016. 

Strategic Imperatives 

After completing the most critical milestones of the Company's transformation plan laid out during the latter half of 2012, Visteon is now a technology-focused, pure-play supplier of automotive cockpit electronics and connected car solutions. The Company has laid out the following three strategic imperatives for 2016 and beyond: 

&#8226; 

Strengthen the Core &#32;- Visteon offers technology and related manufacturing operations for audio, head-up displays, information displays, infotainment, instrument clusters and telematics products. The Company's backlog, defined as cumulative remaining life of program booked sales, is approximately $15.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, or 4.9 times 2015 sales, reflecting a strong booked sales base on which to launch future growth. 

&#8226; 

Move Selectively to Adjacent Products &#32; - As consumer demand continues to evolve with an increase of electronics content per vehicle, the Company strives to further develop expertise in the areas of cockpit domain controllers, next generation safety applications, and vehicle cyber security. These areas require assessment as consumer needs shift and related products complement Visteon's core products. 

&#8226; 

Deliver Cost Efficiencies &#32;- Visteon core business financial results continue to improve with Adjusted EBITDA margin for electronics and corporate of 9.5% in 2015 compared with 7.2% in 2014. The Company expects to deliver cost efficiencies by achieving selling, general and administrative and engineering efficiencies, improving free cash flow, optimizing its capital structure and driving savings benefits as revenues grow. 

The Company&#8217;s Industry 

The Company operates in the automotive industry, which is cyclical and highly sensitive to general economic conditions. The Company believes that future success in the automotive industry is, in part, dependent on alignment with customers to support their efforts to effectively meet the challenges associated with the following significant trends and developments in the global automotive industry. 

&#8226; 

Emissions and safety - Governments continue to focus regulatory efforts on cleaner and safer transportation with the objective of securing individual mobility. Accordingly, OEMs are working to lower average vehicle emissions by developing a more diverse range of vehicles including those powered by hybrid technologies, alternative fuels, and electricity. OEMs are also working to improve occupant and pedestrian safety by incorporating more safety oriented content in their vehicles. Suppliers must enable the emissions and safety initiatives of their customers including the development of new technologies. 

&#8226; 

Electronic content and connectivity - The electronic content of vehicles continues to increase due to various regulatory requirements and consumer demand for increased vehicle performance and functionality. The use of electronic components can reduce weight, expedite assembly, enhance fuel economy, improve emissions, increase safety and enhance vehicle performance. Additionally, digital and portable technologies have dramatically influenced the lifestyle of today&#8217;s consumers who expect products that enable such a lifestyle. This requires increased electronic and technical content such as in-vehicle communication, navigation and entertainment capabilities. While OEMs are taking different paths to connect their vehicles 

to high-speed broadband internet connections in the short-term, future vehicles are expected to be built with vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity systems. 

&#8226; 

Vehicle standardization - OEMs continue to standardize vehicle platforms on a global basis, resulting in a lower number of individual vehicle platforms, design cost savings and further scale of economies through the production of a greater number of models from each platform. Having operations in the geographic markets in which OEMs produce global platforms enables suppliers to meet OEMs&#8217; needs more economically and efficiently, thus making global coverage a source of significant competitive advantage for suppliers with a diverse global footprint. Additionally, OEMs are looking to suppliers for increased collaboration to lower costs, reduce risks, and decrease overall time to market. Suppliers that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing. 

Financial Information about Segments 

The Company's operating structure is organized by global product group, including Electronics and Other. These global product groups have financial and operating responsibility over the design, development and manufacture of the Company's product portfolio. The Company's reportable segments are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Electronics - The Company's Electronics segment provides vehicle cockpit electronics products to customers, including audio systems, information displays, instrument clusters, head up displays, infotainment systems, and telematics solutions. 

&#8226; 

Other - Other includes entities located in Europe previously associated with the Interiors business but not subject to the Interiors Divestiture. Other also includes entities in South America and South Africa previously associated with the Climate business but not subject to the Climate Transaction. 

Further information relating to the Company&#8217;s reportable segments can be found in Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Note 22, &#8220;Segment Information,&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements). 

The Company&#8217;s Products 

The Company designs and manufacturers vehicle cockpit electronics components, modules and systems further described as follows: 

Audio Systems 

The Company offers a range of audio products, including audio head units, amplifiers and analog and digital radios, which deliver consumer device connectivity. Visteon&#8217;s OpenAir&#174; brand of premium connected audio products is based on open architecture, human machine interaction ("HMI") command and control, and wireless communication. These products are designed to allow vehicle occupants &#32; to easily connect their mobile devices to the built-in display to safely access phone functions, listen to music, stream media and enable CarPlay, Android Auto and Baidu Carlife. 

Information Displays &#32; 

The Company offers a range of information displays incorporating a sleek profile, craftsmanship and touch sensors, designed to deliver high performance for the automotive market. These displays can integrate a range of user interface technologies and graphics management capabilities, such as dual view and dual organic light-emitting diode ("OLED") displays. 

Instrument Clusters &#32; 

The Company offers a full line of instrument clusters, from standard analog gauge clusters to high-resolution, fully configurable, display-based devices. These support all vehicle segments, including motorcycles. These clusters can use a wide range of display technologies, graphic capabilities and decorative elements, including OLED, free-form and curved displays. Premium clusters, marketed under the brand LightScape&#174;, support complex 3-D graphics and video features such as driver awareness and camera inputs. 

Head-Up Displays 

The Company provides a complete line of head-up displays ("HUD") that present critical information to the driver in a convenient location and at a comfortable focal distance. Combiner HUD projects a virtual image in front of the driver using a compact, transparent screen mounted on top of the instrument panel. Windshield HUD projects the image directly on the vehicle windscreen. 

Infotainment Systems 

The Company offers a range of infotainment products, based on Open Software Standards technology. These systems are designed to provide embedded content, a driver-centric user interface and cyber security. New features and content are provided by secure over-the-air software upgrades. Built on a scalable platform, Visteon&#8217;s OpenAir&#174; premium infotainment system provides extensible HMI using an intelligent application interface and advanced mobile device connectivity, along with advanced driver assistance systems ("ADAS") and driver monitoring integration. 

Telematics Solutions 

The Company provides a cost-optimized telematics control unit to enable secure connected car services, software updates and data. The Company&#8217;s telematics solution uses a single hardware and flexible software architecture to support regional telematics service providers and mobile networks. The Company&#8217;s wireless gateway platform is designed to meet future connectivity requirements including 4G, V2X, Wi-Fi&#174; and next-generation mobile standards such as 5G. 

SmartCore&#8482; 

The Company offers a security-focused approach to cockpit module consolidation that addresses the increasing complexity of cockpit electronics to improve the driving experience. SmartCore&#8482; combines previously separate modules such as instrument cluster, infotainment, head-up display and advanced driver assistance solution domains on a single-module multi domain controller. Using a holistic view of value, this solution considers the total cost of ownership. It meets the needs of vehicle segments through a scalable and flexible framework. 

The Company&#8217;s Customers 

The Company sells its products primarily to global vehicle manufacturers including Ford, Nissan, Renault, Mazda, BMW, General Motors and Honda. Ford, Mazda and Nissan/Renault are the Company's largest customers and in 2015 accounted for sales of approximately 34%, 16% and 14%, respectively. In 2014 and 2013 Ford accounted for 41% and 52%, respectively, Nissan and Mazda individually accounted for less than ten percent of Visteon sales for both 2014 and 2013. 

The Company records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Price reductions are typically negotiated on an annual basis between suppliers and OEMs. Such reductions are intended to take into account expected annual reductions in the overall cost to the supplier of providing products and services to the customer, through such factors as manufacturing productivity enhancements, material cost reductions and design-related cost improvements. The Company has an aggressive cost reduction program that focuses on reducing its total costs, which are intended to offset customer price reductions. However, there can be no assurance that the Company&#8217;s cost reduction efforts will be sufficient to fully offset such price reductions. The Company records price reductions when probable and reasonably estimable. 

The Company&#8217;s Competition 

The automotive sector is concentrated, but operates under highly competitive conditions resulting from the globalized nature of the industry, high fixed costs and the resulting need for scale economies, market dynamics including share in mature economies and positioning in emerging economies, and the low cost of switching for the end consumer. Accordingly, OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of financial viability, product quality, price competitiveness, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design and manufacturing capability and flexibility, customer service and overall management. The Company's primary independent competitors include Alpine Electronics, Continental AG, Delphi Automotive PLC, Denso Corporation, Harman International, Nippon Seiki, Panasonic Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, and Robert Bosch GmbH. 

The Company&#8217;s Product Sales Backlog 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company modified its backlog definition to represent cumulative remaining life-of-program expected net sales, launching in future periods. The Company&#8217;s Electronics segment backlog was $15.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, compared to $14.1 billion as of December 31, 2014, reflecting an increase of 8%. The Company&#8217;s estimated net sales may be impacted by various assumptions, including new program vehicle production levels, customer price reductions, currency exchange rates and program launch timing. In addition, the Company typically enters into customer agreements at the beginning of a vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill purchasing requirements for the entire vehicle production life cycle. These agreements may be terminated by customers at any time and, accordingly, expected net sales information does not represent firm orders or firm commitments. 

Seasonality and Cyclicality of the Company&#8217;s Business 

Historically, the Company&#8217;s business has been moderately seasonal because its largest North American customers typically cease production for approximately two weeks in July for model year changeovers and approximately one week in December during the winter holidays. Customers in Europe historically shut down vehicle production during a portion of August and one week in December. In China, customers typically shut down during one week in early October and one week in January or February. Additionally, third quarter automotive production traditionally is lower as new vehicle models enter production. 

However, the market for vehicles is cyclical and is heavily dependent upon general economic conditions, consumer sentiment and spending and credit availability. During 2009, the automotive sector was negatively impacted by global economic instability and the lack of available credit. The severity of the decline in 2009 was masked by numerous government stimulus programs and significant growth in certain emerging automotive markets, which caused vehicle production volumes to vary from historical patterns. 

The Company&#8217;s Workforce and Employee Relations 

The Company&#8217;s workforce as of December 31, 2015 included approximately 11,000 &#32;persons, of which approximately 5,000 were salaried employees and 6,000 were hourly workers. Many of the Company&#8217;s employees are members of industrial trade unions and confederations within their respective countries, including Europe, Asia and South America. Many of these organizations operate under collectively bargained contracts that are not specific to any one employer. The Company constantly works to establish and maintain positive, cooperative relations with its unions and work representatives around the world and believes that its relationships with unionized employees are satisfactory. The Company experienced work stoppages of varying lengths in Europe, South America and Asia during the past three years. These stoppages primarily were either national in nature, aimed at customers or were in anticipation of Company restructuring activities at particular facilities. 

The Company&#8217;s Product Research and Development 

The Company&#8217;s research and development efforts are intended to maintain leadership positions in core products and provide the Company with a competitive edge as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers. The Company also works with technology development partners, including customers, to develop technological capabilities and new products and applications. Total research and development expenditures, net of recoveries were approximately $ 294 &#32;million in 2015, $ 257 &#32;million in 2014, and $ 148 &#32;million in 2013. 

The Company&#8217;s Intellectual Property 

The Company owns significant intellectual property, including a number of patents, copyrights, proprietary tools and technologies and trade secrets and is involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Although the Company&#8217;s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining its competitive position, no single patent, copyright, proprietary tool or technology, trade secret or license, or group of related patents, copyrights, proprietary tools or technologies, trade secrets or licenses is, in the opinion of management, of such value to the Company that its business would be materially affected by the expiration or termination thereof. The Company&#8217;s general policy is to apply for patents on an ongoing basis, in appropriate countries, on its patentable developments which are considered to have commercial significance. 

The Company also views its name and mark as significant to its business as a whole. In addition, the Company holds rights in a number of other trade names and marks applicable to certain of its businesses and products that it views as important to such businesses and products. 

The Company&#8217;s Raw Materials and Suppliers 

Raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its products include resins, copper, precious metals, steel and electronics components. All of the materials used are generally available from numerous sources. In general, the Company does not carry inventories of raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;the Company had not experienced any other significant shortages of raw materials. The Company monitors its supply base and endeavors to work with suppliers and customers to attempt to mitigate the impact of potential material shortages and supply disruptions. While the Company does not anticipate any significant interruption in the supply of raw materials, there can be no assurance that sufficient sources or amounts of all necessary raw materials will be available in the future. 

&#160; 

The automotive supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials which have historically placed operational and financial burdens on the entire supply chain. Accordingly, the Company continues to take actions with its customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with customers include collaboration on alternative product designs and material specifications, contractual price escalation clauses and negotiated customer recoveries. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with suppliers include aggregation of purchase requirements to achieve optimal volume benefits, negotiation of cost reductions and identification of more cost competitive suppliers. While these actions are designed to offset the impact of inflationary pressures, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in fully offsetting increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures. 

Impact of Environmental Regulations on the Company 

The Company is subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management. The Company is also subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties it presently owns or operates and at third-party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arranged to send hazardous waste. The Company makes capital expenditures in the normal course of business as necessary to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. For 2015 , capital expenditures associated with environmental compliance were not material nor did such expenditures have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s earnings or competitive position. The Company does not anticipate that its environmental compliance costs will be material in 2016. 

The Company is aware of contamination at some of its properties. The Company is in various stages of investigation and cleanup at these sites and at December 31, 2015, has recorded a reserve of less than $1 million for this environmental investigation and cleanup. However, estimating liabilities for environmental investigation and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control and which may change dramatically. Accordingly, although the Company believes its reserve is adequate based on current information, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its ultimate environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserve.
