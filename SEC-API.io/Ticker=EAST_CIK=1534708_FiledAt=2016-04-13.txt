1. Description of Business and Liquidity &#160; 

The Company was formed in 2008 and is a manufacturer, developer, producer, and marketer of hand-crafted spirits in the following beverage alcohol categories: bourbon, whiskey, rum, and vodka. The Company currently distributes its products in fifteen states (Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Texas, Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland). The Company also generates revenue from tastings, tasting room tours, private parties, and merchandise sales from its facilities in Oregon. The Company is subject to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). The Company is headquartered in Portland, Oregon.

&#160;

On October 31, 2014, Eurocan Holdings Ltd. (Eurocan) consummated the acquisition (the Acquisition) of Eastside Distilling, LLC (the LLC) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Agreement) by and among Eurocan, the LLC, and Eastside Distilling, Inc., Eurocan's wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the Agreement, the LLC merged with and into Eastside Distilling, Inc. The merger consideration for the Acquisition consisted of 32,000,000 shares of Eurocan's common stock. In addition, certain of Eurocan's stockholders cancelled an aggregate of 24,910,000 shares of Eurocan's common stock held by them. As a result, on October 31, 2014, Eurocan had 40,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, of which 32,000,000 shares were held by the former members of the LLC. Consequently, for accounting purposes, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, with the LLC as the acquirer of Eurocan. These consolidated financial statements are presented as a continuation of the operations of the LLC with one adjustment to retroactively adjust the legal common stock of Eastside Distilling, Inc. to reflect the legal capital of Eurocan prior to the Acquisition.

&#160;

Subsequent to the Acquisition, Eastside Distilling, Inc. merged with and into Eurocan, and Eurocan's name was officially changed to Eastside Distilling, Inc. (Eastside). Prior to the Acquisition, Michael Williams Web Design, Inc. (MWWD) was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eurocan and constituted the majority of Eurocan's operations. Pursuant to the Agreement and subsequent activity, MWWD became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastside on October 31, 2014. MWWD's operations were not significant. Eastside and MWWD are collectively referred to herein as &#34;the Company&#34;.

&#160; 

On February 3, 2015, the Company entered into a Separation and Share Transfer Agreement (Share Transfer) with MWWD under which substantially all assets and liabilities of MWWD were transferred to Michael Williams in consideration of MWWD's and Mr. Williams' full release of all claims and liabilities related to MWWD and the MWWD business. Following the Transfer, MWWD ceased to be a subsidiary. As a result of the Share Transfer, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $53,000, which is included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. This gain is primarily the result of the transfer of net liabilities to Michael Williams.

&#160;

The results for the year ended December 31, 2015 referred to in these consolidated financial statements include both the results of Eastside and MWWD (through February 3, 2015). The results for fiscal 2014 referred to in these consolidated financial statements include the results of the LLC.

&#160; 

2. Going Concern &#160;

Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred a loss of $3,601,066 and have an accumulated deficit of $7,561,751 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, we have negative working capital of $1.2 million at December 31, 2015, and have been dependent on funding operations through the issuance of debt, convertible debt and private sale of equity securities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as the going concern. Management&#8217;s plans include continuing to finance operations through the private or public placement of debt and/or equity securities and the reduction of expenses. The financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

&#160;

Management believes that its successful ability to raise capital and increases in revenues will provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. The Company's ultimate success depends on its ability to achieve profitable operations and generate positive cash flow from operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve profitable operations or raise additional capital or financing at acceptable terms.

&#160; 

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#160;

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 

&#160;

The accompanying consolidated financial statements for Eastside Distilling, Inc. were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastside Distilling, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary MWWD (through February 3, 2015). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

&#160;

Segment Reporting 

&#160; 

The Company determined its operating segment on the same basis that it uses to evaluate its performance internally. The Company has one business activity, marketing and distributing hand-crafted spirits, and operates as one segment. The Company's chief operating decision makers, its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, review the Company's operating results on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.

&#160; 

Use of Estimates 

&#160; 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

&#160;

Revenue Recognition 

&#160;

The Company records revenue when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the products and/or services has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.

&#160;

The Company recognizes sales when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers (except in the case of a consignment sale). For consignment sales, the Company recognizes sales upon the consignee&#8217;s (typically the OLCC) shipment to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized as sales upon shipment of the related merchandise. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point, and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase by customers at a retail location. The customer has no cancellation privileges after shipment or upon purchase at retail locations, other than customary rights of return. The Company excludes sales tax collected and remitted to various states from

&#160;

Revenue received from online merchants who sell discounted gift certificates for the Company's merchandise and tastings is deferred until the customer has redeemed the discounted gift certificate or the gift certificate has expired, whichever occurs earlier.

&#160;

Cost of Sales 

&#160;

Cost of sales consists of the costs of ingredients utilized in the production of spirits, manufacturing labor and overhead, warehousing rent, packaging, and in-bound freight charges. Ingredients account for the largest portion of the cost of sales, followed by contract production fees and packaging.

&#160; 

Shipping and Fulfillment Costs 

&#160;

Freight costs incurred related to shipment of merchandise from the Company&#8217;s distribution facilities to customers are recorded in cost of sales.

&#160;

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

&#160; 

Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of the purchase. The Company had no cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

&#160; 

Concentrations 

&#160; 

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, one distributor, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), represented 50% and 67% of trade receivables, respectively. Sales to one distributor, the OLCC, accounted for approximately 32% and 40% of consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160; 

Fair Value Measurements 

&#160;

GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and contains financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities for which the fair value option is elected. At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, management has not elected to report any of the Company's assets or liabilities at fair value under the &#34;fair value option&#34; provided by GAAP.

&#160;

The hierarchy of fair value valuation techniques under GAAP provides for three levels: Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3, if applicable, generally would require significant management judgment. The three levels for categorizing assets and liabilities under GAAP's fair value measurement requirements are as follows:

&#160;

Level 1: Fair value of the asset or liability is determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

&#160; &#160; Level 2: Fair value of the asset or liability is determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.

&#160; &#160; Level 3: Fair value of the asset or liability is determined using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and reflect management's own assumptions regarding the applicable asset or liability.

&#160;

None of the Company's assets or liabilities were measured at fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. However, GAAP requires the disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. Financial instruments consist principally of trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, note payable, and convertible note payable. The estimated fair value of trade receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time to their maturities. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company&#8217;s note payable and convertible notes payable are at fixed rates and their carrying value approximates fair value.

Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 

&#160;

Inventories 

&#160; 

Inventories primarily consist of bulk and bottled liquor and merchandise and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using an average costing methodology, which approximates cost under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. A portion of inventory is held by the OLCC on consignment until it is sold to a third party. The Company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the Company&#8217;s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements. Such write-downs establish a new cost basis of accounting for the related inventory. The Company has recorded no write-downs of inventory for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

&#160; 

Property and Equipment 

&#160;

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from two to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter. The cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reported as current period income or expense. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

&#160; 

Long-lived Assets 

&#160; 

The Company accounts for long-lived assets, including property and equipment, at amortized cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for probable impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If there is an indication of impairment, management would prepare an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these estimated cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value.

&#160;

Goodwill 

&#160;

Goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is analyzed annually for impairment. An annual review is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired. At December 31, 2014, the Company determined that its goodwill recorded as a result of the Acquisition was fully impaired.

&#160; 

Income Taxes 

&#160;

The provision for income taxes is based on income and expenses as reported for financial statement purposes using the &#34;asset and liability method&#34; for accounting for deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company established valuation allowances against its net deferred tax assets.

&#160;

Income tax positions that meet the &#34;more-likely-than-not&#34; recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of income tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with income tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits would be classified as additional income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no unrecognized income tax benefits, nor any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits, accrued or expensed at and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

&#160;

The Company files federal income tax returns in the U.S. and various state income tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to examinations by the related tax authorities for the Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns for years prior to 2011.

&#160; 

Advertising 

&#160; 

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $389,000 and $303,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

&#160; 

Comprehensive Income 

&#160;

Comprehensive (loss) income consists of net (loss) income and other comprehensive income. The Company does not have any reconciling other comprehensive income items for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

&#160; 

Excise Taxes 

&#160; 

The Company is responsible for compliance with the TTB regulations, which includes making timely and accurate excise tax payments. The Company is subject to periodic compliance audits by the TTB. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcohol beverages in varying amounts. The Company calculates its excise tax expense based upon units produced and on its understanding of the applicable excise tax laws. 

&#160; 

Stock-Based Compensation 

&#160;

The Company recognizes as compensation expense all stock-based awards issued to employees. The compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of the related stock-based awards and is recognized over the service period of stock-based awards, which is generally the same as the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on a variety of assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected terms of the awards, risk-free interest rate, and dividend rates, if applicable. Stock-based awards issued to nonemployees are recorded at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments as the underlying stock-based awards vest.

&#160; 

Accounts Receivable Factoring Program 

&#160; 

We use an accounts receivable factoring program with certain customer accounts. Under this program, we have the option to sell those customer receivables in advance of payment for 75% of the amount due. When the customer remits payment, we then receive the remaining 25%. We are charged interest on the advanced 75% payment at a rate of 1.5% per month. This program has improved our liquidity, but there can be no assurance that these programs will continue in the future. Under the terms of the agreement with the factoring provider, any factored invoices have recourse should the customer fail to pay the invoice. Thus, we record factored amounts as a liability until the customer remits payment and we receive the remaining 25% of the non-factored amount. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we factored invoices totaling $99,258 and received total proceeds of $74,444. At December 31, 2015, we had factored invoices outstanding of $17,601. We incurred interest expense associated with the factoring program of $5,867 during the year ended December 31, 2015. We did not factor any invoices during fiscal year 2014.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

&#160; 

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Boards (the &#8220;FASB&#8221;) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 &#8212;Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date:

&#160;

- A lease liability, which is a lessee&#8216;s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and &#160;

- A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee&#8217;s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. &#160;

Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Though permitted, the Company does not plan to early adopt. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.

&#160;

In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (&#8220;ASU 2014-09&#8221;) amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not plan to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (&#34;ASU 2014-15&#34;). The new guidance explicitly requires that management assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and may require additional detailed disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Though permitted, the Company does not plan to early adopt. The Company does not believe that this standard will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (&#34;ASU 2015-11&#34;), which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Though permitted, the Company does not plan to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2015-11 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early application is permitted. We have early adopted as of December 31, 2015.

8 Income Taxes &#160;

The provision for income taxes results in effective tax rates which are different than the federal income tax statutory rate. The nature of the differences for the year ended December 31 were as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Expected federal income tax benefit &#160; $ (1,200,378 ) &#160; $ (1,378,928 ) State income taxes after credits &#160; &#160; (233,015 ) &#160; &#160; (266,684 ) Change in valuation allowance &#160; &#160; 1,442,900 &#160; &#160; &#160; 138,579 &#160; Permanent tax differences &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,497,622 &#160; Other &#160; &#160; (9,507 ) &#160; &#160; 10,911 &#160; Total provision for income taxes &#160; $ - &#160; &#160; $ 1 ,500 &#160; &#160;

The components of the net deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 consisted of the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Deferred tax assets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net operating loss carryforwards &#160; $ 1,582,317 &#160; &#160; &#160; 148,927 &#160; Stock-based compensation &#160; &#160; 61,050 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4,060 &#160; Total deferred tax assets &#160; &#160; 1,643,367 &#160; &#160; &#160; 152,987 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deferred tax liabilities &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Depreciation and amortization &#160; &#160; (61,888 ) &#160; &#160; (14,408 ) Total deferred tax liabilities &#160; &#160; (61,888 ) &#160; &#160; (14,408 ) Valuation allowance &#160; &#160; (1,581,479 ) &#160; &#160; (138,579 ) Net deferred tax assets &#160; $ - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Company has a cumulative net operating loss carryforward (NOL) of approximately $1.6 million, to offset against future income for federal and state tax purposes. These federal and state NOLs can be carried forward for 20 and 15 years, respectively. The federal NOLs begins to expire in 2034, and the state NOLs begins to expire in 2029.

&#160;

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Due to the uncertainty of the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management has determined a full valuation allowance is appropriate.

&#160; 

9. Commitments and Contingencies &#160;

Operating Leases 

&#160;

The Company leases its warehouse, kiosks, and tasting room space under operating lease agreements which expire through October 2020. Monthly lease payments range from $1,300 to $24,000 over the terms of the leases. For operating leases which contain fixed escalations in rental payments, the Company records the total rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The difference between the expense computed on a straight-line basis and actual payments for rent represents deferred rent which is included within accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Retail spaces under lease are subject to monthly percentage rent adjustments when gross sales exceed certain minimums.

&#160;

Legal Matters 

&#160; 

The Company is involved in certain legal matters arising from the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that the outcome of these matters will have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations.

&#160;

10. Net Loss per Common Share &#160;

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without considering any dilutive items. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the potential number of any dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of the incremental common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options and convertible notes. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation if their effective is anti-dilutive. There were no dilutive common shares at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The numerators and denominators used in computing basic and diluted net loss per common share in 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Net loss (numerator) &#160; $ (3,601,066 ) &#160; $ (4,057,171 ) Weighted average shares (denominator) &#160; &#160; 45,750,363 &#160; &#160; &#160; 33,374,007 &#160; Basic and diluted net loss per common share &#160; $ (0.08 ) &#160; $ (0.12 ) &#160;

The total number of shares available for the grant of either stock options or compensation stock under the Plan is 3,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment. The exercise price per share of each stock option shall not be less than 20 percent of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Stock options shall vest at the rate of at least 25 percent in the first year, starting 6-months after the grant date, and 75% in year two.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, there were 1,147,917 unvested options with an aggregate grant date fair value of $476,175. The unvested options will vest in accordance with the vesting schedule in each respective option agreement, which is generally over a period of 6 to 24 months. The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested options at December 31, 2015 was $0. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 52,083 options became vested.

&#160;

The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to measure the grant-date fair value of stock options. The grant-date fair value of stock options issued to employees is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based awards issued to nonemployees are recorded at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments as the underlying stock-based awards vest. To determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the calculation takes into consideration the effect of the following:

&#160;

&#183; Exercise price of the option &#183; Fair value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant &#183; Expected term of the option &#183; Expected volatility over the expected term of the option &#183; Risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option The calculation includes several assumptions that require management's judgment. The expected term of the options is calculated using the simplified method described in GAAP. The simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period. Estimated volatility is derived from volatility calculated using historical closing prices of common shares of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available for the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the options.

&#160;

The following weighted-average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes valuation model for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2015:

&#160;

Risk-free interest rate &#160; &#160; 0.84 % Expected term (in years) &#160; &#160; 2.46 &#160; Dividend yield &#160; &#160; - &#160; Expected volatility &#160; &#160; 74 % &#160;

The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $0.46. The aggregate grant date fair value of the 1,650,000 options granted during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $763,550.

&#160;

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, total stock option expense related to stock options was $140,370. At December 31, 2015, the total compensation cost related to stock options not yet recognized is approximately $395,169, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.60 years.

&#160;

13. Related Party Transactions &#160;

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's chief executive officer paid expenses on behalf of the Company on his personal credit card. These related party advances do not bear interest and are payable on demand. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the balance due to the chief executive officer was approximately $27,075 and $3,000, respectively, and is included in accounts payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

&#160;

On March 9, 2016, the Company filed with the Nevada Secretary of State a Certificate of Designation of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series A Certificate of Designation&#8221;) which sets forth the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series A Preferred&#8221;). Three thousand (3,000) shares of Series A Preferred with a stated value of $1,000 per share were authorized under the Series A Certificate of Designation. Each share of Series A Preferred has a stated value of $1,000, which is convertible into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) at a fixed conversion price equal to $0.15 per share. The Series A Preferred accrue dividends at a rate of 8% per annum, cumulative. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears at the Company&#8217;s option either in cash or &#8220;in kind&#8221; in shares of Common Stock; provided, however that dividends may only be paid in cash following the fiscal year in which the Company has net income (as shown in its audited financial statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for such year) of at least $500,000, to the extent permitted under applicable law out of funds legally available therefor. For &#8216;in-kind&#8221; dividends, holders will receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the amount of the dividend payment due such stockholder divided by (ii) 90% of the average of the per share market values during the twenty (20) trading days immediately preceding a dividend date. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or sale of the Company, each holder of Series A Preferred shall be entitled to receive its pro rata portion of an aggregate payment equal to: (i) $1,000 multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued under the Series A Certificate of Designation multiplied by (iii) 2.5. For all matters submitted to a vote of the Company&#8217;s stockholders, the holders of the Series A Preferred as a class shall have an aggregate number of votes equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number) into which the total shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued under the Series A Certificate of Designation on such date of determination are convertible multiplied by (y) 2.5 (the &#8220;Total Series A Votes&#8221;), with each holder of Series A Preferred entitled to vote its pro rata portion of the Total Series A Votes. Holders of Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights. In addition, the holders of Series A Preferred shall vote separately a class to change any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series A Preferred.

&#160;

On April 1, 2016, the Company&#8217;s 5% convertible note with Crystal Falls Investments, LLC was further amended to extend the maturity date thereunder to May 31, 2016 and to provide for installment payments on the principal amount on such note as follows: $25,000 on April 5, 2016; $35,000 on April 29, 2016; $40,000 on May 16, 2016 and $50,000 on May 31, 2016. Failure to make the installment payments on the prescribed due dates will constitute an event of default under such note.

&#160;

On April 4, 2016, the Company conducted an initial closing for 880 units (&#8220;Units&#8221;) to 12 accredited investors at a price of $1,000 per Unit for an aggregate purchase price of $880,000, of which (i) 407 Units were purchased for cash (ii) 423 Units were purchased by certain of its officers in consideration of $423,000 accrued and unpaid salary and (iii) 50 Units were purchased in consideration of cancellation of outstanding indebtedness..

The Company received gross proceeds of $407,000 from the sale of the 407 Units for cash. We used $28,560 of these proceeds as payment for non-exclusive placement agent fees to FINRA registered broker-dealers. In addition, approximately $25,000 was used to repay outstanding indebtedness under 5% promissory notes. The remaining proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes and to fund growth opportunities. In addition, we issued 5-year warrants to purchase 71,400 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.15 to broker-dealers in connection with the initial closing of this private placement.
