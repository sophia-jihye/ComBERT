Background

The Company was incorporated under the laws of Oklahoma in September 1989 as &#8220;ADDvantage Media Group, Inc.&#8221; In December 1999, its name was changed to ADDvantage Technologies Group, Inc. Our headquarters are located in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.

We (through our subsidiaries) distribute and service a comprehensive line of electronics and hardware for the cable television (&#8220;Cable TV&#8221;) and telecommunications industries. We also provide equipment repair services to cable operators. In addition, we offer our telecommunications customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which we in turn process through our recycling services.

Several of our subsidiaries, through their long-standing relationships with the original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) and specialty repair facilities, have established themselves as value-added resellers (&#8220;VARs&#8221;). ADDvantage has a reseller agreement with Arris Solutions to sell cable television equipment in the United States. We are also one of only three distributors of Arris broadband products. We are a distributor of Cisco video products as a Cisco Premier Partner, which also allows us to sell Cisco&#8217;s IT related products. In addition, we are designated as an authorized third party Cisco repair center for select video products. Our subsidiaries also sell products from other OEMs including Alpha, Blonder-Tongue, RL Drake, Corning-Gilbert, Promax, Quintech, Standard and Triveni Digital. 

In addition to offering a broad range of new products, we also sell surplus-new and refurbished equipment that we purchase in the market as a result of cable or telecommunications operator system upgrades or an overstock in their warehouses. We maintain one of the industry's largest inventories of new and used equipment, which allows us to expedite delivery of products to our customers. We also continually evaluate new product offerings in the broader telecommunications industry as technology in this industry evolves rapidly and will upgrade our product offerings for our customers in order to stay current with their technology platforms. .

Most of our subsidiaries operate technical service centers that service/repair most brands of Cable TV equipment.

Operating Segments

The Company reports its financial performance based on two reporting segments: Cable Television (&#8220;Cable TV&#8221;) and Telecommunications (&#8220;Telco&#8221;).

The Cable TV segment sells new, surplus and refurbished cable television equipment to cable television operators (called multiple system operators or &#8220;MSOs&#8221;) or other resellers that sell to these customers throughout North America, Central America, South America and, to a substantially lesser extent, other international regions that utilize the same technology. In addition, this segment also repairs cable television equipment for various companies.

The Telco segment provides quality new and used telecommunication networking equipment to its world-wide customer base of telecommunications providers and resellers by utilizing its inventory from a broad range of manufacturers as well as other supply channels. In addition, this segment offers its customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which it in turn processes through its recycling program.

Products and Services

Cable TV Segment

We offer our customers a wide range of new, surplus-new and refurbished products across the leading OEM suppliers in the industry that are used in connection with video, telephone and internet data signals.

Headend Products &#8211; Headend products are used by a system operator for signal acquisition, processing and manipulation for further transmission. Among the products we offer in this category are satellite receivers (digital and analog), integrated receiver/decoders, demodulators, modulators, antennas and antenna mounts, amplifiers, equalizers and processors. The headend of a television signal distribution system is the &#8220;brain&#8221; of the system; the central location where the multi-channel signal is initially received, converted and allocated to specific channels for distribution. In some cases, where the signal is transmitted in encrypted form or digitized and compressed, the receiver will also be required to decode the signal.

Fiber Products &#8211; Fiber products are used to transmit the output of cable system headend to multiple locations using fiber-optic cable. In this category, we currently offer products including optical transmitters, fiber-optic cable, receivers, couplers, splitters and compatible accessories. These products convert radio frequencies to light frequencies and launch them on optical fiber. At each receiver site, an optical receiver is used to convert the signals back to radio frequencies for distribution to subscribers.

&#160;

Access and Transport Products &#8211; Access and transport products are used to permit signals to travel from the headend to their ultimate destination in a home, apartment, hotel room, office or other terminal location along a distribution network of fiber-optic or coaxial cable. Among the products we offer in this category are transmitters, receivers, line extenders, broadband amplifiers, directional taps and splitters.

Customer Premise Equipment (&#8220;CPE&#8221;) &#8211; CPE includes digital converters and modems that are boxes placed inside the home that receive, record and transmit video, data and telephony signals. They are the primary interface equipment between the cable operator and the consumer.

Test Equipment &#8211; Test equipment is used in the set-up, signal testing and maintenance of electronic equipment and the overall support of the cable television system. Test equipment is vital in maintaining the proper function and efficiency of this electronic equipment, which helps to provide high quality video, telephone and high speed data to the end user.

Hardware Equipment &#8211; We also inventory and sell to our customers other hardware such as connector and cable products.

We also offer repair services for most brands of cable equipment at our eight service centers.

Telco Segment

We offer our customers a wide range of new and used telecommunication equipment across most major manufacturers consisting primarily of component parts to expand capacity, provide spares or replace non-working components.

Central Office Equipment &#8211; Central office equipment includes optical, switching, and data equipment on a customer&#8217;s communication network. Optical equipment products aggregate and transport internet traffic, switching equipment products originate, terminate and route voice traffic, and data equipment products transport internet and voice over internet protocol (&#8220;VOIP&#8221;) traffic via routers.

Customer Premise Equipment &#8211; CPE includes integrated access devices, channel banks and routers that are placed inside the customer site that will receive the communication signal from the communication services provider.

In addition, we offer our customers decommissioning services for surplus and obsolete equipment, which we then process through our Responsible Recycling (&#8220;R2&#8221;)-certified recycling program.

(a) The Telco segment revenues for fiscal year 2014 are from February 28, 2014 through September 30, 2014.

Revenues attributed to geographic areas are based on the location of the customer. All of our long-lived assets are located within the United States.

Sales and Marketing

In 2016, Cable TV segment sales of new products represented 60% of Cable TV segment revenues and refurbished product sales represented 22%. Repair and other services contributed the remaining 18% of Cable TV segment revenues. Telco segment sales of new products represented 6% of Telco segment revenues and refurbished products represented 84%. Recycle sales and other services contributed the remaining 10% of Telco segment revenues.

We market and sell our products to franchise and private MSOs, telecommunication companies, system contractors and other resellers. Our sales and marketing are predominantly performed by our experienced internal sales and customer service staff as well as our outside sales representatives located in various geographic areas. The majority of our sales activity is generated through personal relationships developed by our sales personnel and executives, referrals from manufacturers we represent, trade shows and advertising in trade journals.

We maintain a wide breadth of inventory of new and used products and many times can offer our customers same day shipments. We carry one of the most diverse inventories of any cable television or telecommunication product reseller in the country, and we also have access to additional inventory via our various supply channels. We believe our investment in on-hand inventory, our product supply channels, our network of regional repair centers and our experienced sales and customer service team create a competitive advantage for us.

Suppliers

In fiscal year 2016, the Cable TV segment purchased approximately 31% of its total inventory purchases directly from Arris Solutions and approximately 19% of its total inventory purchases either directly from Cisco or indirectly through Cisco&#8217;s primary stocking distributor. In addition to purchasing inventory from OEMs, this segment also purchases used or surplus-new inventory from MSOs, who have upgraded or are in the process of upgrading their systems, and from other resellers in this industry.

In fiscal year 2016, the Telco segment did not purchase over 10% of its total inventory purchases from any one supplier. This segment of our business primarily purchases its used inventory from telecommunication companies that have excess equipment on hand or have upgraded their systems or from other resellers in this industry.

Seasonality

In the Cable TV segment, many of the products that we sell are installed outdoors and can be damaged by storms and power surges. Consequently, we can experience increased demand on certain product offerings during the months between late spring and early fall when severe weather tends to be more prominent than at other times during the year.

In the Telco segment, we do not anticipate that quarterly operating results will generally be impacted by seasonal fluctuations.

Competition

The overall telecommunications equipment industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous resellers in the marketplace and declines in the economy have reduced the amount of capital expenditures in our industry, which heightens the competition. In addition, especially for the Cable TV segment, we sell current production products in competition with the OEMs.

Cable TV Segment

We believe we have differentiated ourselves from the OEMs, other resellers and repair operations in the marketplace in the following ways:

&#183;

we sell both new and refurbished Cable TV equipment as well as repair what we sell, while most of our competition does not offer all of these services;

&#183;

we stock both new and refurbished inventory;

&#183;

we stock a wide breadth of inventory, which many of our competitors do not due to working capital constraints;

&#183;

we can reconfigure new and refurbished equipment to meet the different needs of our customers;

&#183;

we can meet our customers&#8217; timing needs for product due to our inventory on hand; and

&#183;

we have experienced sales support staff that have the technical know-how to assist our customers regarding solutions for various products and configurations.

In terms of sales and inventory on hand or available via our supply channels, we believe we are one of the largest resellers in this industry, providing both sales and service of new and refurbished Cable TV equipment.

We also compete with our OEM suppliers as they can sell directly to our customers. Our OEM suppliers have a competitive advantage over us as they can sell products at lower prices than we offer. As a result, we are often considered a secondary supplier by large MSOs and telephone companies when they are making large equipment purchases or upgrades. However, for smaller orders or items that are needed to be delivered quickly, we often hold an advantage over our OEM suppliers as we carry most inventory in stock and can have it delivered in a shorter time frame than the OEM.

Telco Segment

For the Telco segment, we believe our differentiation from other resellers in the marketplace is primarily the following:

&#183;

we stock a broad range of used inventory, which allows us to meet our customers&#8217; timing needs;

&#183;

we have experienced sales support staff that have strong relationships with our customers and technical knowledge of the products we offer;

&#183;

we have the following quality certifications: TL9000 (telecommunications quality certification), ISO 14001 (environmental management certification), OHSAS18000 (occupational safety and health management certification), and R2 (EPA responsible recycling practices for electronics); and

&#183;

we provide multiple services for our customers including deinstallation and decommission of products, storage and management of spares inventory and recycling.

Working Capital Practices

Working capital practices in our business center on inventory and accounts receivable. We choose to carry a relatively large volume of inventory due to our on-hand, on-demand business model. We typically utilize excess cash flows to reinvest in inventory to maintain or expand our product offerings. The greatest need for working capital occurs when we make bulk purchases of surplus-new and used inventory, or when our OEM suppliers offer additional discounts on large purchases. In 2016, we decreased our inventory $0.9 million (before excess and obsolescence reserves) due primarily to decreasing our Telco segment inventory $0.6 million in addition to a decreased inventory position in our Cable TV segment. In 2017, we will be working on further reducing our Telco segment inventory, which should provide further liquidity for our Company. Our working capital requirements are generally met by cash flows from operations and a bank line of credit, which currently permits borrowings up to $7.0 million. We expect to have sufficient funds available from our cash on hand, future excess cash flows and the bank line of credit to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future.

Significant Customers

We sold our equipment and services to approximately 1,300 customers in fiscal year 2016. We are not dependent on one or a few customers to support our business on an on-going basis. Sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated sales in fiscal year 2016, while our sales to our largest five customers were 21% of our consolidated sales in fiscal year 2016, three of which were in the Cable TV segment and two were in the Telco segment.

Personnel

At September 30, 2016, we had 178 employees, including 167 full-time employees. Management considers its relationships with its employees to be excellent. Our employees are not unionized, and we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements.
