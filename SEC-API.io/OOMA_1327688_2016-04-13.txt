 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Ooma is a leading provider of innovative communications solutions and other connected services to small business, home, and mobile users. Our unique hybrid SaaS platform, consisting of our proprietary cloud, on-premise appliances, mobile applications, and end-point devices, provides the connectivity and functionality that power our solutions. Our communications solutions deliver our proprietary PureVoice HD voice quality, advanced features, and integration with mobile devices, at extremely competitive pricing and value. Our platform helps create smart workplaces and homes by providing value-added communications and other connected services and by integrating end-point devices to enable the Internet of Things. Our platform and solutions have the power to provide communications, productivity, automation, monitoring, safety, security, and networking infrastructure applications to our users. 

We drive the adoption of our platform by providing communications solutions to the large and growing markets for small business, home, and mobile users and then accelerate growth by offering new and innovative connected services to our user base. Our small business and home customers adopt our platform by making a one-time purchase of one of our on-premise appliances, connecting the appliance to the internet, and activating subscription services, for which they primarily pay on a monthly basis. Our communications solutions are distinguished by the combination of our proprietary PureVoice HD voice quality, exceptional value, an advanced feature set enhanced by a number of end-point devices, and integration with mobile devices. We believe we have achieved high levels of customer retention and loyalty by delivering exceptional quality and customer satisfaction. 

Our services run on our unique platform consisting of four proprietary elements: our multi-tenant cloud service, custom on-premise appliance, mobile applications, and end-point devices. Ooma&#8217;s cloud provides a high-quality, secure, managed, and reliable connection integrating every element of our platform. Our on-premise appliances incorporate both a custom-designed, Linux-based computer and a high speed network router, with several key features, including wireless connectivity to end-point devices and custom firmware and software applications that are remotely upgradable and extensible to new services. Our mobile applications enable customers to access our product features from anywhere, and our end-point devices enable additional functionality and services. Our platform powers all aspects of our business, not only providing the infrastructure for the communications portion of our business, but also enabling a number of other current and future valuable productivity, automation, monitoring, safety, security, and networking infrastructure applications. 

We currently offer our solutions in the U.S. and Canadian markets. We believe that our differentiated platform and our long-term customer relationships uniquely position us to add new connected services and exploit adjacent markets, all without significant capital investment or high customer acquisition costs to drive their adoption. We offer and/or are developing connected services for the following applications: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Productivity. We offer a small business productivity service, called &#8220;Business Promoter&#8221;, which provides lead generation services to small businesses using proprietary techniques that leverage local, mobile and social media technologies and platforms to enable small businesses to be found, to engage with new prospects, and to receive telephone calls from qualified customer leads. In the future, we expect to launch additional connected services to enhance productivity for small businesses. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Automation, monitoring, safety, and security. Our platform enables an ecosystem for connected services by integrating with other automation solutions. For example, we have integrated Ooma Telo with products from Nest Labs, Inc., a Google company, including the Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector, the Amazon Echo and Amazon Alexa voice service, and a variety of products integrated through the If This Then That (&#8220;IFTTT&#8221;) platform. By combining Ooma&#8217;s communications intelligence with these products&#8217; functions, we enable innovative and valuable features. For example, if the Nest Protect device detects smoke or carbon monoxide when the user is away from home, we provide the ability for the user, through the user&#8217;s mobile device, to connect with emergency services from the user&#8217;s home phone number and address. This allows users to immediately speak with the correct emergency services personnel, saving valuable time. We are currently developing additional connected services for small businesses and homes to enable the Internet of Things, including a home monitoring solution using proprietary sensors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Networking infrastructure. Our on-premise appliances include a high-speed router that has the capacity to provide networking infrastructure solutions. In the future, we expect to launch connected services with applications for networking infrastructure for small businesses and homes. 

We believe that our platform is particularly well-suited to enable the delivery of connected services because it is always on, monitored and interactive. We expect the adoption of our connected services to support the continued growth of our recurring revenue stream. 

&#160;

We have experienced significant revenue and user growth in recent periods, growing our &#8220;core users&#8221; from approximately 481,000 as of January 31, 2014 to approximately 800,000 as of January 31, 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 29%. We define core users as the number of home user accounts, office user extensions, and standalone Business Promoter accounts. We believe that we have one of th e lowest customer churn rates in the industry, with an average monthly core user churn rate of 0.53% for the 12-month period ending on January 31, 2016. Additionally, we had approximately 1.6 million and 1.5 million Talkatone monthly active users as of Jan uary 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have a predictable revenue model with growth in recurring revenue, with total revenue of $88.8 million, $72.2 million and $53.7 million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. Subscription and ser vices revenue, which represents the recurring portion of our total revenue, has increased as a percentage of our total revenue over the last three years, from approximately 66% in fiscal 2014 to 82% in fiscal 2016. We have continued to make significant inv estments in research and development, brand marketing, and channel development, incurring net losses of $(14.1) million, $(6.4) million and $(2.0) million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA was $(6.5) million, $( 3.5) million, $(0.4) million in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operation&#8221; for a description of how we define Adjusted EBITDA and why we believe that it is useful to investors, and a reconciliation to our net loss, which is our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.

Business Promoter 

Business Promoter is a service that helps businesses generate new customer leads. Business Promoter optimizes a business&#8217;s online presence, enabling potential customers to discover the business and engage with it without requiring time or expertise from the business. Business Promoter utilizes location, mobile and social technologies and platforms to generate customer leads by delivering phone calls from potential customers to a business. Ooma Office users can either sign-up for the Business Promoter service on a pay-per-lead basis, or subscribe to unlimited leads through a monthly plan. Under the pay-per-lead model, users generally pay a price per lead that originates from a qualified phone call to the business. 

Business Promoter also operates on a white-label basis for digital marketing agencies representing tens of thousands of business locations. 

Ooma for Residence

Ooma Telo for Home 

Ooma Telo is a complete home communications solution designed to serve as the primary phone line in the home, delivering high-quality voice communications and unique and valuable features. 

Users buy an Ooma Telo and plug it into a high-speed internet connection and standard home phone devices. Users have the option to transfer their existing phone number from their current provider for a one-time fee or to select a new number at no cost. We provide local phone numbers throughout the U.S. and Canada except in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Once set up, users have access to free nationwide calling, international calling with low rates, and standard features such as voicemail, call waiting, caller ID, network address book, and 911 calling, with text alerts when 911 is dialed from the home. The base service is free, but users are required to pay applicable taxes and fees typically ranging from approximately $3.77 to $9.00 per month, depending on the jurisdiction. Based on a typical monthly phone bill of $40 for standard landline service, we estimate that users can save approximately $1,000 in three years by using an Ooma Telo. 

The Ooma Mobile HD app allows Ooma Telo users to make and receive phone calls and access Ooma features and settings with any iOS or Android device over a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection.

Segment Information

We operate in one industry segment generating product and services revenue from the sale of on-premise appliances and end-point devices to our end-customers through our website and from sales through distributors, retailers and resellers. 

&#160;

Backlog 

We generally sign monthly and annual contracts for our subscriptions and generally invoice our customers on a monthly basis for the services purchased. Products are shipped and billed shortly after receipt of an order. We do not believe that our product backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue in any given period as such orders may be rescheduled or cancelled by our partners, or end-user customers, without penalty prior to shipment. Additionally, the majority of our product revenue comes from orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, we do not recognize them as revenues. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales and marketing objective is to grow and retain our customer base, and sell them additional premium services using an integrated and multi-channel marketing approach. We continually test and refine our marketing and sales tactics to drive sales at a low customer acquisition cost. 

We use television and radio advertising to build awareness and interest for our products and services, which benefits both the Ooma Office and Ooma Telo solutions. We believe that television advertising provides an opportunity to build the Ooma brand cost-effectively, educate prospects on Ooma&#8217;s unique combination of quality and value, and capture prospects&#8217; attention. Small businesses and consumers who see our television advertising are directed to our web site and to key retail partners. Radio is used in a highly targeted manner primarily to reach small business owners and decision makers as they commute to and from their workplace. 

We use online marketing including search engine marketing, search engine optimization, display advertising, and social media to attract customers as they do online research for the products and services we offer. For those prospects who do not purchase immediately, we entice them to provide their e-mail address and/or phone number by offering helpful information, relevant case studies and demonstrative webinars to assist in making their purchase decision. We continue to reach out to our prospect leads over time using e-mail and telemarketing until they purchase or the lead is retired. 

We actively mobilize our customers to spread word-of-mouth marketing by sharing Ooma news and information through social media and e-mail. We also encourage our customers to write product reviews on Amazon.com and other online retailer websites. We sell additional services to our existing customer base by offering free trials and promotional offers, as well as sending e-mail communications and leaving messages on their Ooma voicemail service. 

Our small business and home products are sold through both direct channels and retail, with the direct channel as our primary distribution channel for small business and the retail channel as our primary distribution channel for home customers. Our direct sales force is focused on small business sales and includes highly trained sales representatives located in the U.S. responding to inbound telephone calls and sales leads generated through marketing activity and our website. We consider our retail presence a competitive advantage and we are continuing to add retailers who share our growth objectives. Our retail distribution includes national and regional consumer electronics, big box retailers, and leading online retailers, including Amazon.com, Best Buy, Costco.com and others. Additionally, we have certain reseller partnerships with third parties who resell our home communications solution under their brand name. Our Ooma Business Promoter service is sold directly to Ooma Office customers and through digital marketing agencies to businesses seeking to generate leads. 

Customer Support 

Our primary customer support objective is to delight our customers and educate them on the features and benefits of our products to optimize the overall user experience. In addition to providing support to our customers, we employ an active customer management strategy in which we drive incremental revenue through cross-selling of products and services. Our customer support teams also manage the porting process for our customers and our customer billing and payment activities. 

We maintain two customer contact centers, one operated by us in Newark, California, which primarily houses our small business support for our Ooma Office customers, and one operated by our partner Telus in Manila, Philippines, which provides our customer support primarily for our Ooma Telo customers. In order to maximize customer convenience and ease of use, we utilize a variety of communication media to serve the needs of our customers including telephone, online chat, online tutorials, and e-mail. 

Our Platform 

Our unique hybrid SaaS platform consists of our proprietary cloud, on-premise appliances, mobile applications, and end-point devices. They work in concert to support our advanced features, high-quality, and the ability to offer customized connected services, which are vital to driving our high level of customer satisfaction and low customer churn. 

&#160;

We take an integrated approach to the development of our technology. Our extensive engineering resources span both hardware and software and our business scope encompasses the entire platform, giving us the ability to drive new integrated solutions for our customers. We believe our integrated engineering and business strategy is a significant competitive advantage and makes it feasible for us to leverage our platform to deliver a broad range of productivity, automation and infrastructure connected services. 

The integrated approach to our technology allows us to operate at a reduced cost and provides competitive advantages: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Because we designed our on-premise appliances and network elements to work in harmony, we are free to make optimizations that streamline and simplify the elements of the network. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our platform enables us to automatically select, on a call-by-call basis, between over a dozen call termination providers based on call cost and quality. Likewise, our platform allows us to shift our customer base among a several origination vendors. This, combined with our rapid growth creates a favorable environment to demand low costs from our vendors without sacrificing quality. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The tight integration between our engineering and operations teams, combined with the functional nature of our on-premise appliances, facilitates our highly automated network operations, enabling us to efficiently scale our operations. 

Cloud 

Our multi-tenant cloud infrastructure provides a high-quality, secure, managed, and reliable suite of services integrating all elements of the platform. We have built a proprietary cloud in order to optimize quality of service, reliability and security, which are essential elements of our communications solutions. Our cloud simplifies the task of offering new services, and provides consistent performance and economies of scale for all of our connected services. Ooma&#8217;s key cloud capabilities include: telecommunications, custom hosted services, interconnections to third party services (cloud-to-cloud), on-premise appliance management, remote diagnostics support, and billing. 

We have engineered our cloud infrastructure to enable: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Quality of Service through transcoding of data to/from our on-premise appliances, routing control, direct connection to internet transit providers, and strategic location of our data centers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Security through AES128-encrypted media and provisioning information and layered defenses against malicious cyber-threats; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Reliability through redundant data centers in San Jose, California and Sunnyvale, California. 

On-Premise Appliances 

Our purpose-built on-premise appliances are both a custom-designed, Linux-based computer and a high speed network router, with several key features, including wireless connectivity to end-point devices and custom firmware and software applications that are remotely upgradable and extensible to new services. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We harness the power of our on-premise appliances, operating in conjunction with our cloud, to deliver three core technology advantages: 

&#160;

&#183; 

PureVoice HD technology for improved call quality. A common cause of customer churn for internet communications solutions is poor voice quality, which is primarily caused by packet loss or jitter from internet bottlenecks. Our PureVoice HD technology addresses these issues with the following elements: 

&#160;

&#8212; 

High-speed routing with hardware-based quality of service: Ooma&#8217;s on-premise appliances include network ports for both the local area network, or LAN, and the wide area network, or WAN, with a dedicated routing engine connecting the two. The routing engine is capable of routing 100Mbits per second and prioritizes voice traffic over other traffic in the business or home. 

&#160;

&#8212; 

Advanced voice compression technology: The high processing power of our on-premise appliances makes it possible to employ an advanced voice compression technology that reduces the bandwidth required for carrying voice traffic over the customer&#8217;s internet connection by over 70%, while providing greater error concealment than more commonly used voice compression technologies. 

&#160;

&#8212; 

Adaptive redundancy: Our cloud dynamically detects when packets are being lost or delayed and signals our on-premise appliances to send redundant data in succeeding packets. Our cloud then reassembles the packets it receives into the proper data stream in real time. The level of redundancy is dynamically determined based upon the quality of the customer&#8217;s internet connection, which optimizes the balance of latency and quality. Ooma business, home and mobile users can maintain three times packet redundancy while consuming virtually the same bandwidth as competing systems that use less advanced voice compression technology. 

&#160;

&#8212; 

HD Voice: Our on-premise appliances double the sampling rate and sampling precision compared to a traditional voice call to capture a truer picture of the actual sound and provide a HD audio experience to the listener. 

&#160;

&#8212; 

Encrypted data transfer: Signaling between our on-premise appliance and our cloud is embedded in an encrypted virtual private network, or VPN, making it very difficult to illicitly monitor. Likewise, we employ secure real-time protocol, or SRTP, to encrypt the media associated with voice conversations to and from our on-premise appliances. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Extensibility to new services. Our on-premise appliance incorporates extra processing power, networking capability and memory capacity to accommodate future services. We have also incorporated a USB port in the appliance for directly connecting other devices. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Hub for the Internet of Things. Our on-premise appliance supports a wireless networking protocol to facilitate connectivity to other end-point devices and enable the Internet of Things. 

Mobile Applications 

We have made significant investments in developing mobile applications for the iOS and Android operating systems. As a result, nearly every connected service and feature we deploy enhances or can be enhanced through integration with our customer&#8217;s mobile device. We are in the process of integrating our PureVoice HD technology into our Ooma Mobile HD app. We plan to continue enhancing our mobile apps to incorporate features related to our partners&#8217; services (such as Nest Labs, Inc.) and other connected services. 

End-Point Devices 

Ooma has developed a range of end-point devices that together create a full communications solution for our customers. We also enable several proprietary features through our end-point devices, such as picture caller ID and address book sync/dial by name using the Ooma HD2 Handset and pre-programmed sequential dialing by the Ooma Safety Phone. 

Operations and Manufacturing 

We deliver our services through two separate data centers located in San Jose and Sunnyvale, California, both hosted in facilities leased from Equinix, Inc. While our service operations are partially redundant, account provisioning and billing are operated out of the San Jose facility. 

Our network operations and carrier operations teams are responsible for designing our core routing and switching infrastructure, managing growth and maintenance (including the introduction of new services) and orchestrating vendor relationships for hosted services, IP transit and carrier services and daily operation of our cloud and other services. The design of these services, and the tools for monitoring and managing them, are developed in combination with our engineering team. 

&#160;

We contract with manufacturers in Taiwan that have a manufacturing facility in China to produce our on-premise appliance and end-point devices. We configure and ship to our chann el partners and end users through our internal manufacturing and logistics team based in Newark, California. Our internal logistics team also manages reverse logistics for channel and warranty returns and works closely with our engineering team to develop tooling and processes that bring new products into production. 

Engineering, Research, and Development 

We have invested significant time and resources into developing our engineering, research, and development team, resulting in a group with diverse skills, ranging from hardware and radio frequency design to embedded software, network software, telecommunications, database architecture, operations support systems, billing, security, web design and mobile app development. The team develops all aspects of our platform, including our hosted services, on-premise appliance, mobile applications, end-point devices, interconnections to third party services and tools and utilities that facilitate customer provisioning, debugging, billing and reporting. Because our engineering, research, and development team manages all aspects of our solutions, we are able to offer an integrated solution that works seamlessly between software and hardware and to respond to customer feedback to add in additional features and services that works across the entire platform. 

The engineering, research and development team consists of a core set of engineers located primarily in Palo Alto, California, augmented by contract development teams in Canada, India, Ukraine, Russia and New Zealand. 

Competition 

The market for communications solutions and other connected services for small business, home, and mobile users is complex, fragmented, and defined by constant shifts in technology and customer demands. We expect competition to continue increasing in the future. We believe that the defining factors driving competition in our market include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Quality and consistency of communications services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Lifetime value of initial investment and ongoing cost of services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Breadth of features and capabilities; 

&#160;

&#183; 

System reliability, availability and performance; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Speed and ease of activation, setup, and configuration; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ownership and control of the proprietary technology; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Integration with multiple end-point devices and mobile solutions; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. 

We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. 

We face competition from a broad range of providers of communications solutions and other connected services for small business, home, and mobile users. Some of these competitors include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

established communications providers, such as AT&#38;T Inc., Comcast Corporation and Verizon Communications Inc. in the U.S., and Rogers Communications Inc. and others in Canada, that resell on-premise hardware, software and hosted solutions; 

&#160;

&#183; 

other communications companies such as 8x8 Inc., magicJack VocalTec Ltd., RingCentral, Inc. and Vonage Holdings Corp. 

&#160;

&#183; 

companies such as Broadsoft, Inc. and Microsoft Corporation; 

&#160;

&#183; 

traditional on-premise, hardware business communications providers such as Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc. and ShoreTel, Inc., any of which may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud, and their resellers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

mobile communications app companies providing &#8220;over-the-top&#8221; solutions, such as Grasshopper (Citrix, Inc.), LINE Corporation, Pinger, Inc., Viber (Rakuten, Inc.) and WhatsApp, Inc.; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

other large internet companies, such as Google Inc., any of which might launch its own cloud-based business communications services or acquire other cloud-based business communications companies in the future. 

&#160;

Competition with Established Telephone and Cable Companies 

Established telephone companies such as AT&#38;T, Verizon and CenturyLink, and national cable companies such as Comcast and Cox Communications and Time Warner Cable represent a significant portion of our competition in the telecommunications market. These competitors are many times larger and better capitalized than Ooma, continue to make substantial investments in competitive products, features and services, and take significant advantage of their existing business relationships with their very large customer bases. For example, these cable and phone companies often bundle home phone service with Internet access and/or cable television access, and the pricing of these various &#8220;bundles&#8221; may imply a zero or very low price to the customer for home phone service. While we believe that we compete favorably based upon our service features, quality and pricing, such aggressive pricing tactics make it more difficult for us to attract the existing customers of our large competitors.

Competition with Non-traditional Communications Providers

Non-traditional communication providers such as Facebook, Google Voice, WhatsApp and Pinger offer telephony services at little or no cost as an added benefit to their existing customers, and/or to attract additional users. Some of these providers arguably are not in compliance with certain regulatory requirements, for example, to collect certain federal, state and local regulatory taxes and fees, or to provide 911 service, which means their costs to provide telephony services may be substantially less than ours. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements, we control access to our software, documentation and other proprietary information, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. For example, we require our employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf belong to us, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 

As of January 31, 2016, we had five issued patents, fourteen patent applications pending for examination in the U.S., and four patent applications pending for examination in foreign jurisdictions, both of which are related to U.S. applications. Our issued patents will expire between 2028 and 2033. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any issued patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties who typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our products and services, or to integrate software into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. 

Although we rely on laws respecting intellectual property rights, including patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, we believe the technological and creative skills of our personnel, the development of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our products and services are the primary methods of establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. 

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate our rights or to copy or obtain and use our proprietary technology to develop products and services with the same functionality as ours. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and enforcing our intellectual property rights is expensive and uncertain. 

Employees and Contractors 

As of January 31, 2016, we had 139 full-time employees, all of whom were located in the U.S., including 53 in engineering and 28 in sales and marketing. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe that our employee relations are good. 

We also contract with third-party contractors whose employees or subcontractors&#8217; employees perform services for us. As of January 31, 2016, we had 292 of these third-party contractors, including 91 in engineering, 22 in sales and marketing, and 176 in customer support and service. As of such date, 93 are located in the U.S. and 199 internationally. 

&#160;

Facilities 

Our corporate headquarters are located in Palo Alto, California and consist of approximately 18,000 square feet of office space pursuant to a lease agreement that expires November 30, 2017. We lease additional office space in Palo Alto consisting of approximately 2,379 square feet pursuant to a lease agreement that expires April 30, 2017 and a multi-use industrial space consisting of 13,800 square feet pursuant to a lease agreement that expires February 28, 2018. Outside of Palo Alto, we lease warehouse and office space totaling 16,200 square feet in Newark, California, and pursuant to co-location agreements, we lease space from third-party datacenter hosting facilities in San Jose and Sunnyvale, California and Ashburn, Virginia that support our cloud infrastructure. We believe that we will be able to obtain additional space at other locations at commercially reasonable terms to support our continuing expansion. 

Regulatory Matters 

Overview of Regulatory Environment 

Traditional telephone service historically has been subject to extensive federal and state regulation, while Internet services generally have been subject to less regulation. Because some elements of VoIP resemble the services provided by traditional telephone companies and others resemble the services provided by internet service providers, the VoIP industry has not fit easily within the existing framework of telecommunications law and until recently has developed in an environment largely free from regulation. 

The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, the U.S. Congress and various regulatory bodies in the states and in foreign countries have begun to assert regulatory authority over VoIP providers and are continuing to evaluate how VoIP will be regulated in the future. 

Federal Regulation 

As a provider of internet communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC. Some of these regulatory obligations include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. 

Our services are also subject to a number of other FCC regulations. Among others, we must comply (in whole or in part) with: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA, which requires covered entities to assist law enforcement in undertaking electronic surveillance; 

&#160;

&#183; 

requirements to provide E-911 to our customers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

contributions to the USF, which requires that we pay a percentage of our interstate end-user telecommunications revenue to support certain federal programs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

payment of annual FCC regulatory fees based on our interstate and international revenue; 

&#160;

&#183; 

payment of Local Number Portability and North American Numbering Plan Administration fees; 

&#160;

&#183; 

rules pertaining to access to our services by people with disabilities and contributions to the Telecommunications Relay Services fund; 

&#160;

&#183; 

rules requiring reporting to the FCC of certain service outages; 

&#160;

&#183; 

rules requiring notice to the FCC before discontinuing service; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FCC rules regarding CPNI and other proprietary information, which require, among other things, that we not use CPNI for marketing without customer approval, subject to certain exceptions, that we file annual reports regarding CPNI protections, and that we disclose breaches to law enforcement. 

If we do not comply with any current or future rules or regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, may have to restructure our service offerings, exit certain markets or raise the price of our services, any of which could ultimately harm our business and results of operations. 

&#160;

Regulatory Classification of VoIP Services 

To date, the FCC has regulated certain VoIP services without concluding that these services are telecommunications services subject to the traditional common carrier regulation. In various proceedings the FCC has nonetheless imposed certain regulation obligations on interconnected VoIP and certain non-interconnected VoIP services. The FCC may continue to impose additional regulations on these services without resolving their regulatory classification. The FCC could also at any time determine that interconnected VoIP or non-interconnected VoIP services are telecommunications services and thus subject to traditional common carrier regulation. Additional regulation would impose compliance costs and could increase our risk of enforcement or other liability.

VoIP E-911 Matters 

The FCC requires internet voice communications providers, such as our company, to provide E-911 service in all geographic areas covered by the traditional wire line E-911 network. Under the FCC&#8217;s rules, Internet voice communications providers must transmit the caller&#8217;s phone number and registered location information to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point, or PSAP, for the caller&#8217;s registered location. 

In Canada, the CRTC, has imposed similar requirements for fixed/non-native internet voice communications related to the provision of E-911 services in all areas of Canada where the wireline incumbent carrier offers such 911 services. In the case of nomadic internet voice communications, service providers are required to ensure that 911 calls are routed to a call center which routes these calls to the appropriate PSAP based on information provided by the caller or, if the caller is unable to provide location information, based on the last registered address of the caller. The CRTC also mandates certain customer notification requirements pursuant to which new customers are required to be notified of 911 service limitations and to consent to the same before their service with us commences and we are required to provide annual update notifications to our customers of the 911 limitations of our service. 

We provide E-911 service in compliance with the CRTC and the FCC&#8217;s rules, as applicable, to substantially all of our customers&#8217; interconnected VoIP lines. Our mobile platform also allows users to make emergency 911 calls from their mobile devices using their home phone number and address. In some circumstances, 911 calls may be routed to a national emergency call center that routes the call to the appropriate PSAP. 

On August 8, 2014, the FCC adopted an Order setting text-to-911 requirements. The Order requires all CMRS providers and all interconnected text messaging application providers to be able to deliver text messages to PSAPs, by December 31, 2014, and to begin sending text messages to a given PSAP within six months of a valid request. Compliance with this mandate and any additional 911 mandates placed on text messaging providers will impose costs on our business. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we may face significant enforcement liability or other liability risks. 

In connection with the regulatory requirements that we provide E-911 to all of our interconnected VoIP customers, we must obtain from each customer, prior to the initiation of or changes to service, the physical locations at which the service will first be used for each VoIP line. For services that can be utilized from more than one physical location, we must provide customers one or more methods of updating their physical location and in Canada, these customers must be able to update their location online. Because we do not validate the physical address at each location where the services may be used by our customers, and because customers may use the services in locations that differ from the registered location without providing us with the updated information, it is possible that E-911 calls may be routed to the wrong public safety answering point, or PSAP. We are also aware that certain customer registered addresses are incorrect, or may not have been updated. If E-911 calls are not routed to the correct PSAP, and if the delay results in serious injury or death, we could be sued and the damages substantial.

We could be subject to enforcement action by the FCC or the CRTC for our customer lines that do not have E-911 service. This enforcement action could result in significant monetary penalties and restrictions on our ability to offer services. 

Customers may in the future attempt to hold us responsible for any loss, damage, personal injury, or death suffered as a result of delayed, misrouted or uncompleted emergency service calls. The New and Emerging Technologies 911 Improvement Act of 2008 provides that internet voice communications providers have the same protections from liability for the operation of 911 services as traditional wire-line and wireless providers. Limitations on liability for the provision of 911 services are normally governed by state law, and these limitations typically are not absolute. It is also unclear under the FCC&#8217;s rules whether the limitations on liability would apply to those customer lines for which we do not provide E-911 service. In Canada, provincial consumer protection laws may constrain our ability to limit liability to our non-business customers for any liability caused due to the 911 shortfalls inherent in internet voice communications services. 

&#160;

State Regulation 

The FCC has preempted much regulation of internet voice communications services. However, a number of states have ruled that non-nomadic internet voice communications services may or do fall within the definition of &#8220;telecommunications services&#8221; or are otherwise within state telecommunications regulatory jurisdiction and therefore those states assert that they have authority to regulate the service. No states currently require certification for nomadic internet voice communications service providers. Nevertheless, a number of states have imposed certain traditional telecommunications requirements on such services, including assessing state USF or other surcharge requirements, E-911 support and fees and other surcharges on nomadic VoIP providers. A number of states require us to contribute to state USF and E-911, and pay other surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their public policy programs to include the services we provide. We pass USF, E-911 fees and other surcharges through to our customers, which may result in our services becoming more expensive or require that we absorb these costs. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to internet voice communications services like ours. If the FCC determines that VoIP services are telecommunications services, the risk of state regulation will increase significantly. 

International Regulation 

As we expand internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our services. Regulatory treatment of internet communications services outside the U.S. varies from country to country, is often unclear, and may be more onerous than imposed on our services in the U.S. In Canada, our service is regulated by the CRTC, which, among other things, imposes requirements similar to the U.S. related to the provision of E-911 services in all areas of Canada where the traditional telephone carrier offers such 911 services. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand internationally, and on the use of our services in international locations. See the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for more information.
