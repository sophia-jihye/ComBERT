 Item 1. Business 

AXT, Inc. (&#8220;AXT&#8221;, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to AXT, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries) is a worldwide developer and producer of high-performance compound and single element semiconductor substrates , also known as wafers. The dominant substrates used in producing semiconductor chips and other electronic circuits are made from silicon. However, certain chips may become too hot or &#160; perform their function too slowly if silicon is used as the base material . A lternative or specialty materials are used to replace silicon as the preferred base for the electronic circuit s in these situations . We provide such alternative or specialty materials in the form of substrates or wafers , including compound and single element substrates . Our compound substrates combine indium with phosphorous (InP) or gallium with arsenic (GaAs ). Our single element substrates are made from germanium (Ge). Historically, most of our revenue has been derived from sales of semi-insulating and semi-conducting GaAs substrates. &#160; However, in 2015 , our revenue from sales of InP substrates &#160; was greater than our revenue from our sales of each type of GaAs substrates. &#160; We currently sell the following substrate products in the sizes and for the applications indicated:

We manufacture all of our products in the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC or China), which generally has favorable costs for facilities and labor compared with comparable facilities in the United States, Europe or Japan. Our supply chain includes partial ownership of ten companies in China (joint ventures) . We believe this supply chain arrangement provides us with pricing advantages, reliable supply and enhanced sourcing lead-times for key raw materials which are central to our final manufactured products. Our subsidiaries and joint venture companies produce products including 99.99% pure gallium (4N Ga), high purity gallium, arsenic, germanium, germanium dioxide, pyrolytic boron nitride (pBN) crucibles and boron oxide (B2O3). Our ownership and the ownership held by our consolidated subsidiaries in these entities range from &#160; 83 % to 20 %. We have board representation in all ten of these companies. We consolidate the joint ventures in which we have either a controlling financial interest, or majority financial interest combined with the ability to exercise control in substance over the operation or financial decisions made by the investee. We use the equity method to account for joint ventures in which we have smaller financial interest and have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. We purchase portions of the materials produced by these joint venture companies for our own use and the joint venture companies sell the remainder of their production to third parties . 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in California in December 1986 and reincorporated in Delaware in May 1998. We changed our name from American Xtal Technology, Inc. to AXT, Inc. in July 2000. Our principal corporate office is located at 4281 Technology Drive, Fremont, California 94538, and our telephone number at this address is (510) 438-4700 . 

Industry Background 

Certain electronic and opto-electronic applications have performance requirements that exceed the capabilities of conventional silicon substrates and often require high-performance compound or single element substrates. Examples of higher performance non-silicon based substrates include GaAs, InP, gallium nitride (GaN), silicon carbide (SiC) and Ge. 

For example, integrated circuits for wireless handsets and other wireless devices, power amplifier &#160; integrated circuits and some radio frequency integrated circuits are made with semi-insulating GaAs substrates. Semi-conducting GaAs substrates are used to create opto-electronic products , including high brightness light emitting diodes (HBLEDs) that are often used to backlight wireless handsets and liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs and also used for automotive 

&#160;

panels, signage, display and lighting applications. InP is a high performance semiconductor substrate used in broadband and fiber optic applications and data center connectivity . Ge substrates are used in applications such as solar cells for space and terrestrial photovoltaic applications. 

The AXT Advantage 

We believe that we benefit from the following advantages: 

&#183; 

Key leadership in InP technology and revenue growth. We have invested in InP research and development for a number of years and have developed a strong base of proprietary technology that we continue to expand. We experienced over 50% InP year on year revenue growth in 2015 as market applications and demand gained traction. We believe there are significant barriers to entry in the InP substrate market and we are a leading provider of such wafers or substrates. Further, we believe that this market will continue to expand and grow. 

&#183; 

Low-cost manufacturing operation in China . We have manufactured all of our products in China since 2004 , which generally has favorable costs for facilities and labor compared to costs of comparable facilities and labor in the United States , Japan or Europe. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 1,021 of our 1,045 employees (including employees at our consolidated joint venture companies ) are located in China. Our primary competitors have their major manufacturing operations in Germany or Japan. 

&#183; 

Our diverse product offering results in a broader range of customers and application s . We offer a &#160; diverse range of products , &#160; which enables us to have a broad range of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , only one customer accounted for over 10% of revenue and our five largest customers accounted for 40% of our revenue. We believe this diversity enabled us to recover quickly when a large portion of &#160; GaAs chips was replaced with silicon-on-insulator (SOI) &#160; chips &#160; in mobile phone &#160; switches , beginning in 2011 . Further, we believe this diversity gives us a greater likelihood to expand our business in to new applications and markets and benefit from growth in demand for substrates given our pre-established market positions in a broad range of product applications. 

&#183; 

We have partial ownership in ten companies in China that form our sophisticated, vertically integrated supply chain. We believe o ur subsidiaries and joint venture companies in China &#160; provide us with more reliable supply and shorter lead-times for the raw materials central to our final manufactured products compared to third party providers . These materials include gallium, &#160; gallium alloys, indium phosphide poly-crystal, germanium, germanium dioxide, high purity arsenic , pyrolytic boron nitride crucibles (pBN) &#160; and boron oxide &#160; (B2O3) . W e believe this dedicated supply chain will enable us to meet increases in demand from our customers by providing an increased volume of raw materials quickly, efficiently and cost effectively . 

&#183; 

Enhanced revenue diversity through the sale of special materials. Because our strategy allows our subsidiaries to also sell in the open market to third parties, approximately &#160; a quarter of our total sales are from non-substrate products, providing further diversity in our customer base and business model. 

&#183; 

Business model unique among current competitors. We believe we are the only publicly traded &#160; company focused on high-performance compound and single element semiconductor substrates . Most of our &#160; direct competitors are either privately owned companies or division s of large publicly traded companies. We believe the combination of access to U.S. capital markets, U.S.-based product quality standards and China-ba sed manufacturing is an attractive business model to our customers who desire longevity and stability in their supply chain as well as competitive prices . &#160; 

&#183; 

Strong cash position with $4 4 million cash and investments. As a pure play substrate provider we have a strong cash position that enables us to make strategic investments in equipment, technology and resources. Our competitive focus and flexibility is supported by the staying power that this cash ensures. 

&#160;

Strategy 

Our goal is to become the leading worldwide supplier of high-performance compound and single element semiconductor substrates. Key elements of our strategy include: 

Invest in growing InP revenue and protect our proprietary process technology. &#160; We are adding manufacturing capacity for InP to support the revenue growth for this product line. Substrate products often have a very long product life cycle and we believe the InP revenue growth trajectory could be similar to the GaAs product life cycle that ran for more than 10 years. In addition to adding manufacturing capacity , we will continue to invest in InP crystal growth technology, wafer processing technology, market development and customer support . 

Offer diverse products, including custom products. We believe AXT has a reputation in the market place for providing a broad range of products, including custom products. We plan to further promote this brand image as a way to differentiate ourselves in the market place. Some competitors provide only gallium arsenide substrates. We provide gallium arsenide and also indium phosphide and germanium substrates. Some competitors provide only six inch wafers. Our wafers range from one inch up to six inches. We also produce substrates with customer defined specifications which may range from thickness or smoothness and may include adding special additional chemicals such as iron or sulfur. We believe product &#160; diversity can mitigate some of the impact of &#160; down cycles in our market because we are not dependent on a single product or application for revenue. 

Many customers not &#160; just a few large customers. We seek to expand our customer base and avoid dependence on just a few large customers. &#160; We believe our diverse product offering has resulted in a diverse customer base . For the year ended December 31, 2015, only one customer accounted for over 10% of revenue and our five largest customers accounted for 40% of our revenue. We believe customer diversity provides a measure of stability in troubled market conditions . Customer diversification may also enable us to achieve a higher average selling price by reducing our dependence on l arger customers with pricing power. 

China-based manufacturing. We seek to leverage our China-based manufacturing advantage by increasing efficiencies in our manufacturing methods, systems and processes. &#160; In 1998 we decided to locate our manufacturing in China and in 1999 we began to move our manufacturing facilities to the outskirts of Beijing. Approximately 98 % of our employees are based in China. This enables us to compete more effectively against our competitors who, by comparison, are in relatively high cost locations such as Japan and Germany . We plan to further leverage these advantages by investing in training and equipment to increase &#160; productivity and reduce cost. &#160; It is our strategy to combine the benefits of U.S.-based quality and U.S.-based access to capital markets with China-based manufacturing. 

Increase productivity and profitability in our &#160; 10 subsidiaries/joint venture &#160; companies . AXT&#8217;s substrate products are based on specialty materials, many of which are mined and refined in China. The supply and demand equation for specialty materials can be complex and can be volatile. Our strategy to maintain a stable supply chain has been to establish and nurture startup companies in China where we have a majority ownership position or at least a significant equity po sition . Over the years we have established or invested in 10 &#160; companies that are an integral part of our supply chain. We will continue to provide strategic support to these companies and they, in turn, will continue to be the backbone of our supply chain . &#160; We plan to work closely with these companies to increase their productivity and improve their profitability as they continue to support AXT&#8217;s supply chain. 

Sell raw materials into the market place. We leverage the established capabilities of our &#160; 10 subsidiaries and joint ventures by authorizing them to sell materials into the open market, including to some of our direct competitors. 

Promote AXT&#8217;s longevity and stability. We believe recent market trends, including the exit of one of our major competitors in Japan from the gallium arsenide substrate market , has highlighted supply continuity concerns among our customers . Since AXT was established in 1986 and has been a publicly traded company since 1998, w e plan to promote our long operating history and highlight our position as a stable, reliable and long term provider &#160; of substrates and materials by among other things, investing in research and development and high-end processing equipment . 

&#160;

Materials of the future. The specialty materials substrate market &#160; is dynamic and subject to continued changes and cycles . We plan to use our deep knowledge and experience in specialty materials and wafer substrates to seek n ew applications for existing substrates in our portfolio and explore additional materials that may be synergistic with our knowledge base, customer needs and manufacturing lines. 

Technology 

Wafers serve as a cornerstone in semiconductor device fabrication, on which integrated circuits and devices are fabricated. Wafers are sliced up from semiconducting ingots that are grown in the form of cylindrical shape single crystals. Depending on physical properties of the supporting materials, the performance of devices and circuits can be remarkably different. 

AXT uses its&#8217; proprietary Vertical Gradient Freeze (VGF) technique for growing single crystal Indium Phosphide (InP), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and Germanium (Ge) ingots used to produce state-of-the-art wafers for diverse electronic and opto-electronic device and circuit applications. 

InP and GaAs semiconducting compounds are formed combining elements from Groups III and V in the periodic table of elements, whereas Ge is a Group IV elemental semiconductor. Each of these materials has unique properties that determine the best device and/or circuit applications. As a result of their special high electron mobility combined with their direct ban-gap properties, both InP and GaAs wafers have enjoyed dominant roles in the production of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), Solid-state Lasers and Power Amplifiers for mobile phones, to name a few applications. Ge wafers, on the other hand, have played a key role in the manufacturing of special solar cells known as Triple Junction Solar Cells (TJSCs) for space and terrestrial power generation. 

With the recent evolution in several applications InP l asers are projected to play a dominant role in the optoelectronics arena, e.g. s ilicon p hotonics (where InP lasers are a key component) and a utonomous c ars (where special wavelength InP -based l asers are used for object sensing and collision avoidance) . Crystal growth process technology frequently contains steps and procedures that are considered proprietary secrets held by the producer, often including methods to control the temperature within the crucible. InP crystal growth relies on extreme pressure within the crucible. As such it requires not only temperature control methodologies , but also pressure control and stabilization process methodologies, many of which are proprietary trade secrets. It is this combination of variables and the required methods to control them that create a barrier to entry. 

We believe our long -term investment in InP research and development has resulted in a substantive body of proprietary knowledge. In addition, to complement our VGF proprietary growth expertise, in July 2015 , we acquired the InP proprietary process technology and crystal growth equipment from Crystacomm, Inc. , thus adding the capability of growing polycrystalline and large diameter single crystal InP ingots using the Crystacomm proprietary Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) technology. &#160; Crystacomm has a long history in development and experimentation in InP and this acquisition transfers the proprietary technology to us . 

After growing the crystalline ingot, the material is then sawed into individual substrates or wafers. We have continued to invest in wafer processing technology covering each step in the process from sawing to edge smoothing to final cleaning and we believe we have technology and trade secrets addressing the scope of wafer processing. One focus in our recent development programs has been on automation. In this regard, in October 2015, we announced that we had acquired Hitachi Metals&#8217; automated equipment and the related intellectual property portfolio . A significant body of knowledge in this portfolio is considered proprietary trade secrets. We expect to combine the acquired proprietary processing technology and equipment with our existing wafer processing capabilities to better serve our existing and future customer base . 

Products 

We design, develop, manufacture and distribute high-performance semiconductor substrates , also known as wafers . InP is a high-performance semiconductor substrate used in fiber optic lasers and detectors, data center connectivity, silicon photonics, optoelectronic ICs, terrestrial solar cell (CPV), lasers and VCSELs . We make semi- 

&#160;

insulating GaAs substrates used in making semiconductor chips in applications such as amplifiers and switches for wireless devices . Our semi-conducting GaAs substrates are used to create opto-electronic products including High Brightness LEDs, which are often used to backlight wireless handsets and LCD TVs and for automotive, signage, display and lighting applications. Ge substrates are used in emerging applications such as triple junction solar cells for space and terrestrial photovoltaic applications and for optical applications.

Substrates. We currently sell compound substrates manufactured from InP and GaAs , as well as single &#8209;element substrates manufactured from Ge. We supply InP substrates in two-, three &#8209; and four-inch diameters, and Ge substrates in two-, four- and six-inch diameters. We supply both semi-insulating and semiconducting &#160; GaAs &#160; substrates in one -, two-, three &#8209;, four-, five- and six-inch diameters. Many of our customers require customized specifications &#160; such as special levels of iron or sulfur dopants or the waf er thickness . 

We have a long operating history and offer a relatively broad range of products. We promote our product diversity as a way to differentiate ourselves in the market place. Some competitors provide only gallium arsenide substrates. We provide gallium arsenide and also indium phosphide and germanium substrates. Some competitors provide only six inch wafers. Our wafers range from one inch up to six inches. We also produce substrates with customer defined specifications which may range in thickness or smoothness and may include adding special additional chemicals such as iron or sulfur. In addition to our wafers or substrates we also generate revenue from our consolidated subsidiaries who sell raw materials. Product diversity can mitigate some of the down cycles in our market because we are not dependent on a single product or application for revenue. 

Materials. We have partial ownership in 10 companies in China that sell raw materials that may be used in substrate manufacturing or for other purposes . These companies produce products including 99.99% pure gallium (4N Ga), high purity gallium (7N Ga) , gallium alloys, indium phosphide poly-crystal, germanium, germanium dioxide, high purity arsenic, pyrolytic boron nitride crucibles and boron oxide . 

&#160;

Customers 

Before specialty material wafers can be processed in a typical wafer manufacturing facility that constructs the electronic circuit on a chip, a thin layer of structured chemicals is grown on the surface of the substrate. This is called an epitaxial layer. We sell our substrates to companies that apply the epitaxial layer , who then in turn sell the modified wafers to the wafer fabs, chip design companies, LED manufacturers and others . 

Epitaxial layer companies that form our customer base are located in Europe, the United States and Asia. We also sell product to universities and other research organizations who use specialty materials for experimentation in various aspects of semiconducting and semi insulating applications. 

W e have at times sold a significant portion of our products in any particular period to a limited number of customers. One customer represented more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#160; while there was no customer who represented more than 10% of our revenue for the years ended December 2014 and 2013 . Our top five customers, although not the same five customers for each period, represented 40% , 3 4% an d 31% of our revenue for the year s ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 

There were three third - party customers for the raw materials products from our consolidated subsidiaries that accounted for 13%, 13% and 13 % of the revenue from raw materials sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 and &#160; three customers for the raw materials products from our subsidiaries and joint ventures that accounted for 20%, 13% and 11% of the revenue from raw materials sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 and three customers for the raw materials products from our subsidiaries and joint ventures that accounted for 11%, 10% and 10% of the revenue from raw materials sales for the year ended December 31 , 2013 . &#160; Our subsidiaries and joint ventures are a key strategic benefit for us as they further diversif y our sources of revenue . 

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies 

We manufacture all of our wafers/substrate products at our facilities in Beijing, China. We believe this location generally has favorable costs for facilities and labor compared to the United States or compared to the location of some of our competitors in Japan and Germany. 

We use a &#160; two- stage manufacturing process. The first stage deploys our VGF technology for the crystal growth of single element or compound element ingots in diameters currently ranging from one inch to six inch. The growth process occurs in high temperature furnaces built using our proprietary designs. Growing the crystalline elements into cylindrical ingots can take four to twelve days, depending on the diameter and length of the ingot produced. The second stage includes slicing or sawing the ingot into wafers or substrates , then processing each substrate to strict specifications, includ ing grinding to reduce the thickness and then polishing and cleaning each su bstrate . &#160; Many of the process steps utilize proprietary knowledge and chemical baths. 

Wafers from each ingot will include some material that does not meet specifications or quality standards. Defects may occur as a result of inherent factors in the materials used in the crystalline growth process. They may also result from variances in the manufacturing process. We have many steps in our line that are partially or fully automated but other manufacturin g steps are performed manually. We intend to i ncrease the level of automation . In 2015 , we purchased wafer processing equipment from Hitachi Metals that we expect will increase automation in our production line and , therefore , reduce variability and defects. In addition , we secured a manufacturing license from Hitachi Metals. This license includes detailed work instructions for using the equipment purchased and allows us to apply the proprietary wafer processing technology at any step and on any form of equipment in our line. &#160; We expect to deploy this equipment in stages during 2016. Due to potential defects , yield is a key factor in our manufacturing cost. Other key elements are the initial cost of the raw material elements, manufacturing equipment , factory loading, facilities and labor. Our Beijing facilities are approximately 300,000 square feet and we employ approximately 677 employees at this site. We believe our current employee base is appropriate for our current production volume. In 2015 , we also acquired equipment from an InP company, Crystacomm, that specializes in the LEC method of crystal growth. The Crystacomm equipment is being installed in our Fremont, CA facility . 

&#160;

We have formed 10 subsidiaries and joint ventures companies in China that form the backbone of our supply chain model. These companies provide us with reliable supply and shorter lead-times for raw materials central to our manufactured products including gallium, gallium alloys, indium phosphide poly-crystal, germanium, germanium dioxide, high purity arsenic, pBN and boron oxide . We believe that these subsidiaries and joint ventures have been and will continue to be advantageous in allowing us to procure materials to support our planned growth. In addition, we purchase supply parts, components and raw materials from several other domestic and international suppliers. We depend on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain critical materials used in the production of our substrates, such as quartz tubing and polishing solutions. We generally purchase our materials through standard purchase orders and not pursuant to long-term supply contracts . 

Sales and Marketing 

We sell our substrate products directly to customers through our direct salesforce in the United States and China &#160; and through independent sales representatives and distributors in Europe and other areas of Asia . Our direct salesforce is knowledgeable in the use of compound and single &#8209;element substrates. Our application engineers work with customers during all stages of the substrate manufacturing process , &#160; from developing the precise composition of the substrate through manufacturing and processing the substrate to the customer&#8217;s specifications. &#160; We believe that maintaining a close relationship with customers and providing them with ongoing engineering support improves customer satisfaction and will provide us with a competitive advantage in selling other substrates to our customers. Six of our employees who frequently work with customers have PhD s in physics or material science , illustrating our serious commitment &#160; to customer support . 

International Sales. International sales are a substantial part of our business. Sales to customers outside North America (primarily &#160; the &#160; United States) accounted for approximately 87%, 88% and 88% of our revenue during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively . T he primary markets for sales of our substrate products outside of the United States are to customers located in Asia and Western Europe. 

Our subsidiaries and joint venture companies &#160; sell specialty raw materials including 4N, 5N, 6N, 7N and 8N gallium, boron oxide, germanium, arsenic, germanium dioxide, pyrolytic boron nitride crucibles used in crystal growth and parts for MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy). These subsidiaries and joint ventures &#160; have their own separate sales &#160; force s &#160; and sell directly to their own customers in addition to selling raw materials to us . 

Research and Development 

To maintain and improve our competitive position, we focus our research and development efforts on designing new proprietary processes and products, improving the performance of existing products, increasing yields and reducing manufacturing costs. We also conduct research and development focusing on larger diameter wafers and in our history we have consistently developed new products based on larger wafer diameters. Crystal growth of specialty earth materials becomes significantly more difficult as the ingot diameter increases because a consistent temperature, and in the case of InP, consistent control of the pressure, must be applied over a larger surface area. In 2015 we acquired certain proprietary crystal growth technology from Crystacomm. 

Our current substrate research and development activities focus on continued development and enhancement of GaAs, InP and Ge substrates, including improved yield, enhanced surface and electrical characteristics and uniformity, greater substrate strength and increased crystal length. In 2015 we acquired a significant number of proprietary wafer processing stations from Hitachi Metals. The Hitachi Metal s purchase includes a license covering the use of the proprietary equipment and Hitachi Metals&#8217; proprietary wafer process ing technology. 

Our three consolidated subsidiaries conduct research and development focusing on gallium alloys, gallium refinement and pyrolytic boron nitride crucibles used in high temperature crystal growth. 

We have assembled a multi &#8209;disciplinary team of skilled scientists, engineers and technicians to meet our research and development objectives. Research and development expenses were $5.7 million in 2015, compared with $4.1 million in 2014 and $ 3.4 million in 2013 . 

&#160;

Competition 

The semiconductor substrate industry is characterized by rapid technological change and price erosion, as well as intense competition. We compete in the market for GaAs substrates with our expertise in VGF technology, product quality, response times and prices. However, we face actual and potential competition from a number of established companies that may have advantages not available to us , including substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources; greater name recognition; and more established relationships in the industry , and they may utilize these advantages to expand their product offerings more quickly, adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly, and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products. 

We believe that the primary competitive factors in the markets in which our substrate products compete are: 

&#183; 

quality; 

&#183; 

price; 

&#183; 

performance; 

&#183; 

meeting customer specifications; 

&#183; 

customer support ; and 

&#183; 

manufacturing capacity. 

Our ability to compete in target markets also depends on factors such as: 

&#183; 

the timing and success of the development and introduction of new products , including larger diameter wafers, and product features by us and our competitors; 

&#183; 

the availability of adequate sources of raw materials; 

&#183; 

protection of our proprietary methods, systems and process; 

&#183; 

protection of our products by effective use of intellectual property laws; and 

&#183; 

general economic conditions. 

The large majority of our customers specialize in epitaxial growth, a chemical layer grown on top of our wafers. Typically our customer or prospective customer has at least &#160; two substrate suppliers qualified for the production of its products. Qualified suppliers must meet industry &#8209;standard specifications for quality, on-time delivery and customer support. Once a substrate supplier has qualified with a customer, price, consistent quality and current and future product delivery lead times become the most important competitive factors. A supplier that cannot meet a customer &#8217; s current lead times or that a customer perceives will not be able to meet future demand and provide consistent quality can lose market share. Our primary competition in the market for compound semiconductor substrates includes Freiberger Compound Materials, JX, Umicore , Sumitomo Electric Industries and China Crystal Technology Corp., (CCTC) . We believe that at least two of our competitors are shipping high volumes of GaAs substrates manufactured using a technique similar to our VGF technique. In addition, we also face competition from semiconductor device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own use, and from companies, such as TriQuint Semiconductors, RFMD and Skyworks that are actively developing alternative materials and marketing semiconductor devices using these alternative materials . For example , silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, a silicon wafer technology that produces satisfactory devices at lower cost , has been proven in the market. &#160; From 2011 to 2013, SOI technology displaced GaAs chips in key sectors, primarily the radio frequency (RF) switching function in cell phones. 

&#160;

B ecause of our vertically integrated , sophisticated supply chain through our subsidiaries and joint venture companies , we believe we are the only compound semiconductor substrate supplier to offer a full suite of raw materials . We believe this gives us a unique competitive advantage because we have greater control and stability over the needed materials. Further, we believe we have some advantage in manufacturing costs.

Protection of our Intellectual Property 

Our success and the competitive position of our VGF technology depend on our ability to maintain our proprietary trade secrets and other intellectual property protections. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology. We believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological innovation in the markets for our products, our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership depends as much on the skills of our research and development personnel as upon the legal protections afforded our existing technologies. To protect our trade secrets, we take certain measures to ensure their secrecy, such as executing non-disclosure agreements with our employees, customers and suppliers. However, reliance on trade secrets is only an effective business practice insofar as trade secrets remain undisclosed and a proprietary product or process is not reverse engineered or independently developed. 

To date, we have been issued forty-four (44) patents that relate to our VGF products and processes, ten (10) in the United States (US), four (4) in Japan (JP), twenty-five (25) in China, one (1) in Europe, one (1) in Canada, one (1) in Korea, and two (2) in Taiwan. Patents have a protected life of 20 years from filing date. Our patents have expiration dates ranging from one expiration in 2016 to 2032. In some cases we may consider filing divisional, continuation or continuation-in-part of the existing patents for additional claims. We have two (2) US patent applications pending and seventeen (17) foreign patent applications pending including patent applications in Europe (3), China (10) and Japan (4). Furthermore, in aggregate, our three consolidated joint venture companies have been issued 44 patents in China. 

In the normal course of business, we periodically receive and make inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In dealing with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

Environmental Regulations 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including laws in China as well as in the United States &#160; and Europe . These laws, rules and regulations govern the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing, research and development and sales demonstrations. We maintain a number of environmental, health and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature. As part of these programs, we regularly monitor ongoing compliance. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial liability for personal injury, clean-up efforts, fines and suspension or cessation of our operations. The regulatory landscape shifts and changes in China as that country attempts to address its environmental pollution. Because we manufacture all of our products in China, we are subject to an evolving regulatory administration requiring changes in our equipment and securing new permits. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had &#160; approximately 702 employees , &#160; which consisted of approximately 25 employees in our headquarters in Fremont and approximately 677 employees in Beijing. In addition, our three consolidated subsidiaries had , in total, approximately 3 43 employees. In aggregate, we and our subsidiaries had 1,045 employees, of whom 851 were principally engage d in manufacturing, 121 &#160; in sales and administration, and 73 &#160; in research and development. Of these 1,045 employees, 25 &#160; were located in the United States and 1,020 in China. 

&#160;

Most workers in China are represented by unions. As of December 31, 2015 , 879 employees in China including employees of our subsidiaries were represented by unions, but we have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
