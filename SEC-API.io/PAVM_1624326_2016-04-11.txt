 Item 1. Business 

We are a medical device company organized to conceive, develop and commercialize a diversified pipeline of innovative products we believe address unmet clinical needs and possess attractive market opportunities. Our goal is to enhance and accelerate value creation by employing a business model focused on capital and time efficiency. We intend to continuously explore promising ideas and opportunities that fulfill our project selection criteria without limiting ourselves to any target specialty or condition. 

Our current pipeline includes the following five lead projects, all of which are the subject of patent applications. One of these projects, NextFlo, also has an issued patent. These projects are all in the development phase and have not yet received regulatory approval. 

&#8226; 

PortIO: A novel long-term implantable vascular access device with no indwelling intravascular component. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Caldus: Completely disposable tissue ablation devices which can also be used for renal denervation to treat hypertension. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

CarpX: Completely percutaneous device to treat carpal tunnel syndrome. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

NextCath: Self-anchoring catheters which do not require suturing, traditional anchoring techniques or costly add-on catheter securement devices. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

NextFlo: Highly accurate disposable infusion pumps using stored potential energy and variable flow resistors. 

&#8203;

In addition to our five lead projects, we are working on projects which are currently in the conceptual phase. As is the case with our lead projects, these additional projects cover a wide range of clinical conditions and procedures, including sleep apnea, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), laparoscopic hernia repair, cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology and endotracheal intubation. 

Our leadership team is comprised of three accomplished medical device entrepreneurs, Dr. Lishan Aklog, Michael J. Glennon and Dr. Brian J. deGuzman. They founded Pavilion Holdings Group (&#8220;PHG&#8221;), a medical device holding company, in 2007 and Pavilion Medical Innovations (&#8220;PMI&#8221;), a venture-backed medical device incubator, in 2009. Between 2008 and 2013, PHG and PMI founded the following four distinct, single-product medical device companies. 

&#8226; 

Vortex Medical Inc. was founded in 2008 with $3.5 million in capital. It created the AngioVac system, designed to remove large volume clots and other undesirable intravascular material. It received its initial U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) clearance in 16 months after the company was founded. AngioVac was first commercialized at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital in December 2009. Vortex Medical marketed the AngioVac system across the United States until it was acquired in October 2012 by AngioDynamics Inc. (Nasdaq: ANGO) for $55.0 million in guaranteed consideration. At the time of its acquisition the company was cash-flow positive, carried no debt and its sole funding source was $3.5 million of capital raised. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Saphena Medical Inc. was founded in 2013 with $3.0 million in capital. It created the VenaPax nextgeneration endoscopic vessel harvest device for use during coronary artery bypass surgery, which received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) clearance in 18 months after the company was founded. VenaPax was first commercialized at Massachusetts General Hospital in October 2014. VenaPax is currently being marketed across the United States. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Kaleidoscope Medical LLC was founded in 2013 with $1.5 million in capital. It has created a novel, reversible inferior vena caval filter which was submitted to the FDA for 510(k) clearance in 16 months. Its submission is currently under review. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Cruzar Medsystems Inc. was founded in 2013 with $2.5 million in capital. It has created a novel peripheral chronic total occlusion (CTO) device for use in peripheral arterial disease, which received its initial FDA 510(k) clearance in December 2015. 

&#8203;

&#8203;

PAVmed was created to adapt this model to a multi-product company with access to public capital markets. We believe this model allows us to conceive, develop and commercialize our pipeline of medical device products using significantly less capital and time than a typical medical device company. 

Our Business Model 

In contrast to pharmaceuticals and other life science technologies, which typically require long and capital intensive paths to translate cellular or biochemical processes into commercially-viable therapeutics or diagnostics, we believe that medical devices have the potential to move much more rapidly from concept to commercialization with significantly less capital investment. Many commercially successful medical devices are often elegant solutions to important and prevalent clinical problems. Most medical device companies, however, are not structurally or operationally equipped to fulfill this potential. According to a report by Josh Makower, M.D., Consulting Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, the typical medical device company will spend over $31.0 million and take approximately five years to develop and commercialize a product through the FDA&#8217;s 510(k) pathway and over $100.0 million and seven or more years through the FDA&#8217;s Premarket Approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) pathway. 

Prior to forming PAVmed, our leadership team established a model to realize this potential in single-product companies by advancing medical device products from concept to commercialization using significantly less capital and time than a typical medical device company. When previously applied to single-product venture backed companies, the model utilized a virtual business structure. PAVmed&#8217;s structure enables us to retain the model&#8217;s tight focus on capital and time efficiency and the core elements which drive that efficiency, including limited infrastructure and low fixed costs, while taking advantages of the economies of scale and flexibility inherent in a multi-product company. 

Project Selection 

A key element of our model is the project selection process. We choose projects to develop and commercialize based on characteristics which contribute to a strong commercial opportunity. We place a heavy emphasis on medical device products with the potential for high-margins and high-impact in attractive markets without regard to the target specialty or clinical area. 

Our project selection process begins with the identification of an unmet clinical need. We seek prevalent medical conditions where we believe an opportunity exists to advance the care of the patient through improvements in existing technologies or the introduction of new platform technologies. In the current healthcare environment, this usually means that our products have to be less invasive and more cost effective. We select projects which we believe have the potential to lessen procedural invasiveness and/or the opportunity to shift care from the surgical operating room to lower-cost venues such as the interventional suite or the ambulatory setting. We expect our products to decrease complications, hospital stays, recovery times and indirect costs associated with a patient&#8217;s loss of productivity. 

For example, at the time of its introduction, Vortex Medical&#8217;s AngioVac system was a new platform technology which for the first time allowed physicians to remove large blood clots from patients without the need for open surgery or clot-dissolving medications. This allowed AngioVac to command premium pricing using surgical reimbursement codes, achieve high gross margins and enter a large addressable market consisting of hundreds of thousands of patients who previously did not have a non-surgical/ non-thrombolytic treatment option. On the other hand, Saphena Medical&#8217;s VenaPax system is an improvement to existing endoscopic vessel harvesting tools which promises to shorten procedure times and decrease vessel trauma at a lower overall cost, providing it an opportunity to capture market share based on price and efficacy. 

Additional characteristics which impact a project&#8217;s commercial opportunity are its technology, regulatory and reimbursement profiles. We typically select projects with strong intellectual property position, low to moderate technological complexity, low to moderate manufacturing costs and primarily disposable products that do not require significant capital equipment. 

One of the most important features we consider is the project&#8217;s regulatory pathway, both in the U.S. and internationally. The FDA&#8217;s less arduous 510(k) pathway requires us to demonstrate that our product is safe and substantially equivalent to FDA-cleared predicates. The FDA&#8217;s more costly and prolonged PMA 

pathway requires us to demonstrate that our product is safe and effective through randomized clinical studies. A product which is eligible for the 510(k) pathway will require substantially less capital and time than one that requires full PMA clearance. Although we favor products eligible for the FDA&#8217;s 510(k) pathway, with or without clinical safety studies, we may also pursue PMA pathway products with large addressable markets. We have a variety of options to commercialize such products more efficiently by initially, or even exclusively, targeting European or emerging markets which have shorter, less costly regulatory pathways for such projects. We also attempt to identify narrower applications and indications with lower regulatory hurdles that will allow us to start commercializing our product, while broader applications and indications with higher hurdles move through the regulatory process. 

The project&#8217;s reimbursement profile, both in the U.S. and internationally, is another very important component of the project&#8217;s commercial opportunity. We prefer projects with existing reimbursement codes, the opportunity to seek reimbursement under higher-value surgical procedure codes or the potential to seek reimbursement under narrow, product-specific codes as opposed to bundled procedure codes. 

Development and Commercialization Processes 

Once we add a project to our pipeline, we map out development and commercialization processes specifically tailored to the product seeking to optimize capital and time efficiency and maximize value creation. The model emphasizes parallel development processes, such as engineering, quality, regulatory, supply chain, and manufacturing, utilizing outsourced, best-in-class process experts on an as-needed basis. We initially select the shortest, most-efficient path to commercialization of a safe and effective first-generation product. We then proceed with iterative product development based on real-life product performance and user feedback. 

We intend to continue to utilize outsourced best-in-class process experts. We have strong relationships with a network of experts in design engineering, regulatory affairs, quality systems, supply chain management and manufacturing, including many with highly specialized skills in areas critical to our current and future pipeline. We will not be reluctant, however, to in-source certain heavily utilized process experts when and if we decide that such a move will enhance our ability to execute on our strategy. As we grow, we expect to maintain a lean management infrastructure while expanding our bandwith primarily with skilled project managers. 

Although the PHG and PMI companies were created with a credible path to self-commercialization, they were fundamentally &#8220;built to sell.&#8221; We believe our structure will enhance our flexibility to commercialize our products compared to these and other single-product, development-stage companies. We retain the flexibility to fully commercialize our products ourselves or co-market them with strategic partners through sales and distribution agreements. We may also choose to monetize products through licensing agreements or the sale of the products&#8217; underlying technology if consistent with our broader business strategy. We currently expect to commercialize our products through a network of independent U.S. medical distributors. We eventually may, however, choose to build (or obtain through a strategic acquisition) our own sales and marketing team to commercialize some or all of our products if it is in our long-term interests. As our pipeline grows, we may choose to jointly commercialize subsets of related products which target certain medical specialties or healthcare locations. 

Our Pipeline 

Since our inception, we have conceived and developed a pipeline of projects which fulfill our selection criteria. Our initial focus is on five lead projects in the areas of medical infusion, tissue ablation and hand surgery. We will need to receive regulatory clearance in order to commercialize these products. We believe it will require $1.5 million to $3.0 million and 12 to 24 months to achieve initial regulatory clearance for each product. Additional capital may be required for us to commercialize these products and/or pursue additional regulatory clearances. The foregoing are estimates and it may take more time or funding than we anticipate to commercialize our products. In addition, there is no assurance that any of our products will ever be commercialized or, if commercialized, will achieve the results we expect.

PortIO &#8212; Long-term Implantable Vascular Access Device 

The Market. Long-term vascular access devices, including peripherally inserted central catheters, tunneled catheters or implanted ports, are used to deliver various medications, fluids, blood products, nutrition or other therapeutic agents to patients with a wide variety of clinical conditions over multiple episodes spanning a period of weeks to months. A report by iData Research Group estimates the market for such devices to be several billion dollars annually. The market is moderately fragmented and highly commoditized, with slight premium pricing for modest features, including anti-infective coating, anti-thrombotic properties, tip location and power injector compatibility. 

Current Devices and their Limitations. The decades-old core technologies underlying currently available long-term vascular access devices have several limitations which relate directly to the intravascular component of the device. Up to 10% of such devices become infected, which can lead to costly and severe complications and even death (van de Wetering, Cochrane Database 2013). Since they are in constant contact with the blood stream, current devices require regular flushes to clear stagnant blood and prevent thrombus formation and occlusion. Despite these maneuvers, up to one-third of long-term vascular access devices become occluded at some point during their implantation period (Baskin, et al., Lancet 2009). This complication requires treatment with clot-dissolving agents or removal and implantation of a new device at an alternative site which in turn can lead to additional complications. Many chronically ill patients requiring long-term vascular access devices have poor or no central venous access as a result of repeated instrumentation of the veins resulting in thrombosis or scarring. Finally, most long-term vascular access devices require surgical insertion and removal and require careful handling by trained clinicians to prevent the introduction of air into the circulation. 

Our Solution. We have developed a novel, implantable vascular access device which does not require accessing the central venous system and does not have an indwelling intravascular component. It is designed to be highly resistant to occlusion and, we believe, may not require regular flushing. It features simplified, near-percutaneous insertion and removal, without the need for surgical dissection or radiographic confirmation. It provides a near limitless number of potential access sites and can be used in patients with chronic total occlusion of their central veins. We believe that the absence of an intravascular component will result in a very low infection rate. We have filed a provisional patent application, performed proof-of-concept testing in animals, developed a working prototype and completed our design work for the first-generation device. We are working with our contract manufacturing partners to build a commercial product. We anticipate an FDA 510(k) pathway, with our without clinical safety studies. We believe that it will require up to $1.5 million and 12 to 18 months to receive FDA 510(k) clearance. Once this product is commercialized, we believe it will have lower cost-of-goods than existing implantable vascular access devices and premium pricing based on improved outcomes and reduced costs. Our initial target will be patients with poor venous access, but the addressable market includes all patients requiring long-term vascular access. 

Caldus &#8212; Disposable Tissue Ablation Devices, Including Renal Denervation for Hypertension 

The Market. Tissue ablation involves the targeted destruction of tumors or benign tissues with pathologic impact (e.g. gastrointestinal, endometrial and cardiac) using one of a variety of commercially-available ablation devices based on a specific energy source (e.g. radiofrequency, microwave, laser, ultrasound, cryoablation). With the exception of cryoablation, all of these devices act through a common pathway of cellular hyperthermia. A 2014 report by Transparency Market Research estimates the tissue ablation market to generate $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion in annual revenue. More recently, the renal nerves have been identified as a therapeutic target for ablation in patients with refractory hypertension. Despite a widely publicized clinical trail which failed to meet its endpoint, many believe that renal denervation remains an attractive clinical and commercial opportunity with approximately 10 million U.S. and 100 million worldwide patients with resistant hypertension (Pimenta et al. Circulation 2012; 125-1594-96). 

Current Devices and their Limitations. All commercially-available devices or those under development for renal denervation rely on some form of a console to generate the ablation energy. These consoles, whether sold or leased as capital equipment or incorporated into the disposable costs, represent a significant portion of the cost of the technology and the procedure. These costs can significantly impact procedural margins and marketing in emerging countries with limited biomedical staff. Another limitation of current 

devices is that they depend on maintaining the conductivity of its energy through the tissue during the ablation period. For example, radiofrequency ablation depends on electrical conductivity to generate heat, but creating too much heat near the probe can generate charring which increases impedance and decreases the effective range of the ablation. A wide variety of technologies and techniques have been developed to accommodate the challenges of ablating across a large distances using radiofrequency (e.g. multi-electrode probes, cooling, irrigation and complex power algorithms). As a result, these tissue ablation modalities typically require a complex, external console to assure the precise amount of energy is delivered to the tissue. In addition, the consoles require on-going maintenance and monitoring by the manufacturer and local facility technical staff to assure they remain safe for use in patients. This can be a particular burden when commercializing such devices in emerging markets where access to qualified technical personnel may be limited. 

Our Solution. We are developing completely disposable tissue ablation devices, including for renal denervation, based on direct thermal ablation of the tissue using heated fluid. We take advantage of the fact that all currently available devices, except those utilizing cryoablation, ultimately act by increasing the tissue temperature to cytotoxic levels for a given period of time. Our device uses a proprietary infusion device to continuously deliver heated fluid to a specially designed balloon catheter which heats the target tissue above its cytotoxic threshold according to a specified pattern. We have completed proof-of-concept work, thermal fine element analysis simulations validating our approach and working prototypes of the infusion device and balloon catheter. We have filed two provisional patent applications and have initiated design work on the proprietary infusion system and balloon catheter. We anticipate an FDA 510(k) pathway for traditional tissue ablation targets and a PMA pathway for renal denervation. With regard to the renal denervation application, we will closely monitor the progress of technologies working their way through U.S. regulatory clearance and tailor our regulatory and commercial strategy accordingly. We anticipate that in the early phases, our strategy will likely focus on European regulatory clearance and target emerging markets where the clinical opportunity (high incidence of hypertension with less coordinated primary care) and commercial opportunity (difficulties acquiring and maintaining capital equipment) may be greatest. We believe that it will take 12 to 24 months and up to $3.0 million to receive FDA 510(k) clearance for traditional tissue ablation targets and European CE Mark clearance for renal denervation. Once this product is commercialized, we believe that our completely disposable system will have significantly lower procedural costs and higher margins than existing technologies. We also believe that a completely disposable tissue ablation device has the potential to gain market share in traditional tissue ablation applications by competing on price and eliminating the need for on-going maintenance and monitoring of capital equipment. 

CarpX &#8212; Percutaneous Device to Treat Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 

The Market. Carpal tunnel syndrome (&#8220;CTS&#8221;) is the most common cumulative trauma disorder and accounts for over half of all occupational injuries. The carpal tunnel is an anatomic compartment in the wrist through which tendons and the median nerve pass. Cumulative trauma leads to inflammation which manifests itself clinically through its compressive effect on the median nerve, resulting in motor and sensory dysfunction in the hand. A survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that 2.5% of U.S. adults, or approximately five million individuals, have CTS and about 350,000 surgical procedures are performed annually for CTS. According to the CDC, CTS accounts for two million office visits per year. According to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research CTS costs the U.S. over $20.0 billion in annual workers&#8217; compensation costs. 

Current Devices and their Limitations. Patients who have failed to improve with physical therapy or other non-invasive treatments are candidates for interventions which seek to relieve the compression of the median nerve by cutting the transverse carpal ligament, which forms the superficial wall of the carpal tunnel. Traditional surgical approaches are effective, but invasive and have to be performed in a surgical operating room. Endoscopic approaches are less invasive, but are more technically challenging, more expensive and have been associated with a higher complication rates. They still require a surgical incision and some surgical dissection before the endoscope is passed into the carpal tunnel. Two less-invasive devices are currently on the market. One device attempts to use transillumination to guide blind passage of a protected knife and the other passes a saw-like device blindly or by ultrasound guidance. Technical limitations have hindered market acceptance of these devices. 

Our Solution. We are developing a completely percutaneous technique to treat CTS. We believe our device will allow the surgeon to relieve the compression on the median nerve without an open incision or the need for endoscopic or other imaging equipment. To use our device, the operator first advances a percutaneously placed guidewire through the carpal tunnel under the ligament. Our device is then advanced over the wire and positioned in the carpal tunnel under ultrasonic guidance. When activated it creates space within the tunnel, confirms that the nerve is protected from the cutting element and divides the ligament. As a completely percutaneous technology, we believe our device will be significantly less invasive than existing treatments. We also believe that it will allow for more extensive lateral dissection within the tunnel and more reliable division of the ligament, resulting in lower recurrence rates than some of the less-invasive approaches. We have filed a provisional patent application and tested working prototypes in cadavers. We anticipate a 510(k) FDA pathway with or without clinical safety studies. We believe that it will take 12 to 18 months and up to $3.0 million to receive FDA 510(k) clearance. Once this product is commercialized, we believe it will have the potential to (i) decrease procedural costs by shifting the procedure from the operating room to an office setting while retaining similar reimbursement to traditional surgical approaches, (ii) reduce post-operative pain and (iii) accelerate the patient&#8217;s return to full activity. Our device may also be applicable to other clinical situations where percutaneous division of a fibrous structure can be used for therapeutic effect such as plantar fasciitis and extremity compartment syndromes resulting from trauma or ischemia. 

NextCath &#8212; Self-Anchoring Short-Term Catheters 

The Market. A wide variety of short-term catheters are used in clinical practice most commonly to infuse fluids, medications or other substances into a vein or other structures. They are also used for monitoring physiologic parameters and draining visceral organs or cavities. The most commonly used short-term catheters are peripheral and central venous catheters. According to a report by iData Research Group, over 90% of hospitalized patients receive a peripheral venous catheter (PVC) during their stay and up to seven million patients receive a short-term central venous catheter (CVC) or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). They estimate the market for these catheters alone to be several billion dollars annually. The market is highly commoditized with very few product features commanding premium pricing. There is an increasing appreciation, however, of the importance of catheter securement in preventing complications of all indwelling catheters. There has been an explosion of separate propriety devices marketed to facilitate catheter securement. A report by iData Research Group estimates the catheter securement market to be approximately $4.0 billion annually. 

Current Devices and their Limitations. Many of the central features of venous catheters have not evolved over decades despite several limitations. For example, venous catheters may need to remain in place for 72 hours or longer, but carry a significant risk of dislodgement during that period. Currently marketed short-term catheters are not self anchoring. PVC&#8217;s and PICC&#8217;s have been traditionally anchored to the skin with simple tape or some other adhesive incorporated into the sterile dressing. According to a report by Dr. Gregory J. Schears, a pediatric anesthesiologist and expert on catheter securement, both microscopic and macroscopic movements from inadequate catheter securement can lead to complications including vascular injury and dislodgment. Catheter dislodgement leads to increased pain, increased costs and potentially more serious complications arising from interruption of critical treatments or bleeding. These of course can also adversely impact quality of care. Monitoring catheter patency and security and reinserting dislodged catheters is labor intensive. CVC&#8217;s are usually sutured to the skin, a process which leads to increased pain and exposure to needle sticks. A wide variety of catheter securement devices are currently marketed. Some have been shown to decrease complications relative to traditional techniques, but add cost and complexity to the process. 

Our Solution. We are developing self-anchoring short-term catheters which do not require suturing, traditional anchoring techniques or costly add-on catheter securement devices. We are initially focusing on simpler and less risky PVC&#8217;s and will proceed to CVC&#8217;s thereafter. Our self-anchoring technique, however, is applicable to most, if not all, short-term catheters such as gastrointestinal tubes and drainage catheters. The self-anchoring mechanism is integral to the catheter. It allows insertion with standard techniques and the use of simple clear sterile dressings. We believe that the force required to dislodge our catheters will be significantly greater than traditional techniques and at least as high as add-on catheter securement devices. We also believe that they will be more resistant to micromotion than other techniques. We have filed a 

provisional patent application and completed head-to-head testing of retention forces, comparing our working prototype to several competing products, which has validated our approach. To achieve commercialization, we will need to receive regulatory clearance. We anticipate an FDA 510(k) pathway without clinical safety studies. We believe that it will take 12 to 18 months and up to $1.5 million to receive FDA 510(k) clearance. Once this product is commercialized, we believe it will garner premium pricing based on fewer complications and reduced overall costs. 

NextFlo &#8212; Highly-Accurate Disposable Infusion Pumps 

The Market. Each day, over one million patients receive some type of infusion and 90% of hospitalized patients receive an intravenous infusion at some point during their hospital stay (Husch et al. Quality &#38; Safety in Health Care 2005; 14:80-86). An increasing number of these patients are receiving infusions of medications or other substances outside of a hospital, in ambulatory facilities and at home. Infusion pump errors, however, are a serious ongoing problem and represent a large share of the overall human and economic burden of medical errors. Electronic infusion pumps have become expensive, high-maintenance devices and have been plagued in recent years with recalls due to serious software and hardware problems. Disposable infusion pumps (&#8220;DIPs&#8221;) have many attractive features that favor their use in these settings over electric infusion pumps. Patients tend to favor DIPs because they are small, disposable, simple to operate, easy to conceal, and allow for greater mobility. They are used to deliver medications including antibiotics, local anesthetics and opiods. According to a report by Transparency Market Research, the overall global infusion market is estimated to be over $5.0 billion annually and DIPs account for approximately 10% of this market. 

Current Devices and their Limitations. Currently marketed DIPs are powered by elastomeric membranes, compressed springs, compressed gas or vacuum and controlled by mechanical flow limiters. The primary limitation of DIPs is that they can be highly inaccurate in actual use because they can be susceptible to changes in operating conditions (e.g. temperature, atmospheric pressure, viscosity, back pressure, partial filing and prolonged storage). As a result, their safety profiles make them unsuitable for use with medications, such as chemotherapeutics, where flow accuracy is critical to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and avoid complications. The FDA&#8217;s MAUDE database includes numerous reports of complications and even deaths as a result of DIPs infusing a particular medication too slowly or too fast. 

Our Solution. We are developing highly-accurate disposable infusion pumps using stored potential energy and variable flow resistors. We acquired U.S. Patent 8,622,976 issued January 7, 2014 and associated U.S. and international patent applications, &#8220; System and Methods for Infusion of Fluids Using Stored Potential Energy and a Variable Flow Resistor. &#8221; We have built on the principles underlying this patent and developed a new concept whereby the variable resistor does not have to be mechanically-linked to the infusion drive mechanism. This simplifies the design and expands the range of potential follow-on products. We have performed extensive computer simulation testing on various embodiments and have demonstrated highly-accurate flow rates across a wide range of driving pressures. We have initiated design work for the first embodiment. Upon completion of this analysis, we will file additional patent applications and begin our design process. The device is designed to be completely disposable and manufactured from inexpensive plastic and rubber parts. We anticipate an FDA 510(k) pathway without clinical safety studies. We believe that it will take 12 to 18 months and up to $2.0 million to receive FDA 510(k) clearance. Once this product is commercialized, we believe it will command a premium price over existing, low-accuracy, DIPs without significantly higher cost-of-goods and expand the market for DIPs. We also believe the accuracy of our device will allow it to be used with a broader range of drugs, thereby significantly expanding the addressable market. Finally, we believe it will significantly decrease costs by reducing or eliminating the need for trained healthcare personnel to initiate or monitor the infusion. We also believe that our variable resistor technology may also be applicable to inpatient infusions, allowing them to be accurately delivered with gravity instead of electric infusion pumps. 

Additional Projects 

In addition to our five lead projects, we are working on projects which are currently in the conceptual phase. As is the case with our lead projects, these additional projects cover a wide range of clinical conditions and procedures, including sleep apnea, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 

laparoscopic hernia repair, cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology and endotracheal intubation. We believe these additional projects meet our selection criteria and will result in products addressing unmet clinical needs in attractive markets. We anticipate filing provisional patent applications on these additional projects over the next several months and will begin proof-of-concept and early prototyping work as resources permit. 

Our Implementation Strategy 

We intend to advance our lead projects towards commercialization as quickly and efficiently as possible and expand our project pipeline by advancing our conceptual phase projects through patent submission and early testing. 

Although we will continue to conceive and develop products internally, as we grow and expand our resources, we intend to expand our pipeline with innovative projects sourced from third parties. In contrast to pharmaceuticals and other life sciences technologies, medical device innovation often begins with one, or at most a few, clinicians and/or engineers identifying an unmet clinical need and proposing a technological solution to address that need. Many academic medical centers and other large institutions try to aggregate their intellectual property through technology transfer centers and, more recently, through &#8220;innovation&#8221; centers which do not merely secure and transfer intellectual property, but actually advance projects internally prior to spinning them out for eventual commercialization. 

It is our belief that, despite these efforts, only a small fraction of the potential pool of intellectual capital (i.e. the universe of individual clinicians with innovative product ideas) is participating in medical device innovation. These clinicians rarely engage in the process for a variety of reasons, including the belief that they are too busy, can&#8217;t afford to divert time away from their practice or that the upfront out-of-pocket costs are too great. Other clinicians believe that they lack the knowledge or connections to successfully navigate the process. Technology transfer and full-fledged innovation centers have only had modest success in getting their clinicians to bring them innovative product ideas and even less success getting these products commercialized. Even centers with extensive resources are usually limited in their ability to advance products beyond the pre-clinical phase and are dependent on a shrinking pool of early-stage medical device venture capital to bring their products to market. Furthermore, some technology transfer and innovation centers associated with not-for-profit hospitals, universities, endowments and charitable organizations may be precluded from directly engaging in commercial sales of medical devices, creating opportunities for us to commercialize and market their intellectual property. 

Our capital and time efficient model puts us in strong position to partner with innovative clinicians and academic medical centers focusing on medical device innovation. We are developing a collaboration model focused on licensing technologies for development and commercialization. Since our founding we have been contacted by clinicians and centers inquiring about opportunities to work with us on developing and commercializing their ideas and technologies. 

Whether internally or externally sourced, we seek to maintain balance within our pipeline with shorter-term, lower-risk projects which offer the opportunity for more rapid commercialization, generating revenue to support development of longer-term projects. As each project moves through our pipeline from concept to commercialization, we continuously reassess the project&#8217;s long-term commercial potential, balance it against other projects in the pipeline and re-allocate resources accordingly. As such, we expect to have much greater flexibility to move products through our pipeline based on the actual developments and the overall interests of our company. We may accelerate, decelerate, pause or abandon a project and increase or decrease resources applied to a project based on a variety of factors including available capital, shifts in the regulatory, clinical, market and/or intellectual property landscape for a particular project, the emergence of one or more projects with significantly greater commercial potential, or any other factor which may impact its long-term commercial potential. 

Sales and Marketing 

We currently expect to commercialize our products through a network of independent U.S. medical distributors. We focus on high-margin products which are particularly suitable to this mode of distribution. A high gross margin allows us to properly incentivize our distributors, which in turn allows us to attract the 

top distributors with the most robust networks in our targeted specialties. Independent distributors play an even larger role in many parts of Europe, most of Asia and emerging markets worldwide. 

We eventually may, however, choose to build (or obtain through a strategic acquisition) our own sales and marketing team to commercialize some or all of our products if it is in our long-term interests. We may also choose to enter into distribution agreements with larger strategic partners whereby we take full responsibility for the manufacturing of our products but outsource some or all of its distribution to a partner with its own robust distribution channels. Such agreements may include regional carve outs, minimum sales volumes, margin splitting and/or an option or right of first offer to purchase the technology at a future date. As our pipeline grows, we may choose to jointly commercialize subsets of related products which target certain medical specialties or healthcare locations. 

Manufacturing 

We currently have no plans to manufacture our own products because the fixed overhead costs and limited flexibility that come with owning manufacturing facilities are not consistent with our capital efficient model. The entire medical device industry, including many of its largest players, depends heavily on contract manufacturers operating in the United States and abroad. Medical device manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other authorities. Compliance with these regulations is costly and particularly onerous on small, development-phase companies. Contract manufacturers can also take advantage of significant economies of scale in terms of purchasing, machining, tooling, specialized personnel, sub-contracting or even off-shoring certain processes to lower-cost operators. These economies are simply not available to us. 

We have relationships with many contract manufacturers, including those with specialized skills in several processes important to our devices. We expect them to have sufficient capacity to handle our manufacturing needs and anticipate that our growth will be better served by deploying our resources to expand our pipeline and commercialization efforts. 

We intend to work closely with our contract manufacturing partners to establish and manage our products&#8217; supply chain, dual sourcing whenever possible. We expect to help them design and build our products&#8217; manufacturing lines including subassembly, assembly, sterilization and packaging and to work closely with them to manage our quality system, to assure compliance with all regulations and to handle inspections or other queries with regulatory bodies. Our contract manufacturers have the ability to add lines and shifts to increase the manufacturing capacity of our products as our demand dictates. We may ship our products directly from our contract manufacturers, but we may also choose to utilize third-party regional warehousing and distribution services. 

Intellectual Property 

Our business will depend on our ability to create or acquire proprietary medical device technologies to commercialize. We intend to vigorously protect our proprietary technologies&#8217; intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. Patent protection and other proprietary rights are thus essential to our business. Our policy is to aggressively file patent applications to protect our proprietary technologies including inventions and improvements to inventions. We seek patent protection, as appropriate, on: 

&#8226; 

the product itself including all embodiments with future commercial potential; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

the methods of using the product; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

the methods of manufacturing the product. 

&#8203;

In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we intend to file counterpart patent applications in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, China and other countries worldwide. Foreign filings can be cumbersome and expensive and we will pursue such filings when we believe they are warranted as we try to balance our international commercialization plans with our desire to protect the global value of the technology. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. 

We intend to continuously reassess and fine-tune our intellectual property strategy in order to fortify our position in the United States and internationally. Prior to acquiring or licensing a technology from a third party, we will evaluate the existing proprietary rights, our ability to adequately obtain and protect these rights and the likelihood or possibility of infringement upon competing rights of others. 

We will also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We intend to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and/or proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, independent contractors and others entities who may have access to proprietary information. We will generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual property to us as a condition of employment with us. All of our consulting agreements will pre-emptively assign to us all new and improved intellectual property that arise during the term of the agreement. 

Our current patent portfolio consists of the following:

Coverage and Reimbursement 

Our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used. 

In the United States, third-party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements. In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory 

surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program&#8217;s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. Most recently, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, signed into law in April 2014, provided for a 0.5% update from 2013 payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2014 and a 0% update from January 1 until April 1, 2015. 

Competition 

Developing and commercializing new products is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. We face intense competition worldwide from medical device, biomedical technology and medical products and combination products companies, including major medical products companies. We may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA or other regulatory approvals, or patent protection, for new products. Our competitors may commercialize new products in advance of our products. Our products also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, some of which currently are considered part of the standard of care. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are: 

&#8226; 

the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

acceptance by surgeons and the medical device market generally; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

ease of use and reliability; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

technical leadership and superiority; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

effective marketing and distribution; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

speed to market; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement. 

&#8203;

We will also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in our current and future products areas. In order to compete effectively, our products will have to achieve market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective. 

Research and development costs 

Research and development costs increased by approximately $478,000 from $11,000 to approximately $489,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the period from June 26, 2014 (inception) through December 31, 2014. This increase was due to contract research spending on all five of our product candidates during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to limited early product design costs on just our PortIO product candidate incurred during the period from June 26, 2014 (inception) through December 31, 2014. We expect research and development costs to increase as we advance our five product candidates toward the point of seeking regulatory clearance in late 2016 and early 2017.

Government Regulation 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The following is a summary of the government regulations applicable to our business. 

FDA Regulation 

Any product we may develop must be cleared by the FDA before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, recordkeeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and products. 

In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy: 

&#8226; 

Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (often referred to as a 510(k) application), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, post-market surveillance, additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Class III: special controls and approval of a pre-market approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) application. 

&#8203;

In general, the higher the classification, the greater the time and cost to obtain approval to market. There are no &#8220;standardized&#8221; requirements for approval, even within each class. For example, the FDA could grant 510(k) status, but require a human clinical trial, a typical requirement of a PMA. They could also initially assign a device Class III status, but end up approving a device as a 510(k) device if certain requirements are met. The range of the number and expense of the various requirements is significant. The quickest and least expensive pathway would be 510(k) approval with just a review of existing data. The longest and most expensive path would be a PMA with extensive randomized human clinical trials. We cannot predict how the FDA will classify our products, nor predict what requirements will be placed upon us to obtain market approval, or even if they will approve our products at all. 

To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another currently legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a currently legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a currently legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require PMA. In addition, any additional claims the Company wished to make at a later date may require a PMA. If the FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, they will issue a Not Substantially Equivalent letter, at which point the Company must submit and the FDA must approve a PMA before marketing can begin. 

During the review of a 510(k) submission, the FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide that the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us. 

Clinical Trials of Medical Devices 

One or more clinical trials may be necessary to support an FDA submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE application to the FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, 

showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board (IRB) has approved the study. 

During any study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA&#8217;s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application. 

Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices 

After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 

&#8226; 

the FDA Quality Systems Regulation (QSR), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experience associated with use of the product. 

&#8203;

We will continue to be subject to inspection by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. 

Manufacturing cGMP Requirements 

Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval. We expect to use contract manufacturers to manufacture our products for the foreseeable future we will therefore be dependent on their compliance with these requirements to market our products. We work closely with our contract manufacturers to assure that our products are in strict compliance with these regulations. 

Other U.S. Regulation 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to 

challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

Federal Anti-Kickback Statute 

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. 

Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 

Federal False Claims Act 

The False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes &#8220;any request or demand&#8221; for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical, device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of products for unapproved, and thus noncovered uses. 

The government may further prosecute, as a crime, conduct constituting a false claim under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike civil claims under the False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. 

Physician Payment Sunshine Act 

There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, released its final rule implementing section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act that imposes new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer&#8217;s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of&#8201; $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of&#8201; $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures.&#8221; 

Certain states, such as California and Connecticut, also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, and other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts. 

Healthcare Reform 

Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products, or for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or limit coverage of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. Alternatively, the shift away from fee-for-service agreements to capitated payment models may support the value of our products which can be shown to decrease resource utilization and lead to cost saving&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for both payors and providers. 

The recent implementation of the Affordable Care Act is an example that has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. 

The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices. In addition, it implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (&#8220;PPACA&#8221;) was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 

2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will stay in effect through 2024 unless congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. 

International Regulation 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. We may be subject to regulations and product registration requirements in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements. 

European Union 

The EU will require a CE mark certification or approval in order to market our products in the various countries of the European Union or other countries outside the United States. To obtain CE mark certification of our products, we will be required to work with an accredited European notified body organization to determine the appropriate documents required to support certification in accordance with existing medical device directive. The predictability of the length of time and cost associated with such a CE mark may vary, or may include lengthy clinical trials to support such a marking. Once the CE mark is obtained, we may market our product in the countries of the EU. 

European Good Manufacturing Practices 

In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice (GMP), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with GMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product. 

Employees 

We have two employees and four executive officers, two of whom are also members of our Board of Directors. We do not currently have any other employees. 

Our Corporate History

We were incorporated on June 26, 2014 in the State of Delaware under the name PAXmed Inc. In April 2015, we changed our name to PAVmed Inc.

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not consummated our initial public offering and there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.
