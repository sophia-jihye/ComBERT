 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

As used in this annual report on Form 10-K and unless otherwise indicated, the terms the terms &#8220;Zoned Properties&#8221;, &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Zoned Properties, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Tempe Industrial Properties, LLC, Gilbert Property Management, LLC, Green Valley Group, LLC, Kingman Property Group, LLC, Chino Valley Properties, LLC, Zoned Oregon Properties, LLC, Zoned Colorado Properties, LLC, and Zoned Illinois Properties, LLC, as the context may require. 

&#160; 

Business Overview &#160; 

&#160; 

Zoned Properties, Inc., incorporated in Nevada on August 25, 2003, believes that the traditional commercial real estate industry is being disrupted by many factors that can be characterized as &#8220;mega trends.&#8221; These trends include technological changes, shifting demographics resulting in a greater influence of millennials and social changes. The utilization of commercial property for retail, business and education is being affected by digital means as opposed to physical means. As a commercial property, project development and management services company, our mission is to identify, develop, and manage properties, initially for the medical marijuana industry and, as our operations develop, for other emerging industries. Our strategy, which is aligned with these shifting trends, positions us well to create property value and enhanced cash flow from rents leveraging our expertise in zoning, permitting, security, energy efficiency, waste and water remediation and sustainable design. 

&#160; 

In order to drive value creation, one of trends we have focused on with respect to commercial properties has been the emergence on a state-by-state basis of licensed medical marijuana dispensaries and cultivation facilities. We have established a focus on commercial real estate development in this space to derive value from the new and emerging medical marijuana industry without directly participating in the cultivation, distribution, or sale of medical marijuana products. While we intend to expand into a variety of emerging industries, our current focus is on developing projects within the emerging medical marijuana industry. 

&#160; 

The core of our business involves identifying and developing properties that exist within highly regulated zoning regions and may be candidates for re-zoning. For the licensed medical marijuana industry, local jurisdictions typically develop strict zoning regulations that dictate the specific region within which a licensed cultivation or retail property can operate. These regulations often include setbacks for example restricting the licensed facility from being within a mile of any parks, schools, churches, or residential districts. In some jurisdictions, local representatives will simply adopt the rules and regulations established by the state legislation. It is at that point that the local representatives welcome participation from the community and developers such as our company to establish more customized regulations for zoning that meet the local community&#8217;s needs. 

&#160; 

We have been closely involved with local representatives in each of the developed properties currently held in our portfolio. For example, we have worked directly with local representatives in Tempe, Arizona over the past year to continue to define and develop local code that regulates the development of licensed medical marijuana facilities. The code amendments directly impact the continued development of our licensed medical marijuana cultivation facility that operates within city limits. 

&#160; 

The process of establishing zoning and permitting will directly impact our ability to place a licensed operator in a long-term lease agreement. In a scenario where the zoning and permitting process has not been completed, such as is the case for our property in Gilbert, Arizona, we continue to work with local representatives to explore development possibilities as the industry evolves. We approach these situations on a case-by-case basis. In locations where we conclude that the zoning and permitting may not be feasible at this time but have a possibility to be successful in the future, we will likely hold the undeveloped property or lease the property out in the interim. 

&#160; 

The successful development of zoning, permitting, construction and placement of long-term tenants creates an increased value for the property. Our property in Kingman, Arizona was successfully developed in this manner. The long-term lease agreement with a licensed operator has led to a leased-fee appraisal valued above five times the initial acquisition cost. We charge over $35 per square foot in rent, a significant premium compared to standard market rates in that region. 

&#160; 

This is an essential aspect of our overall growth strategy and value creation because we target specifically zoned properties that can be developed as candidates for specific industry operators. Once the properties have been acquired, adequately zoned and permitted, the opportunity to increase their value becomes substantially greater as a result of above market rents, as the demand for these properties within the specific zoning region increases. 

&#160; 

We focus on acquiring properties that have the potential to increase significantly in value and use development strategies to build long-term growth. We have established a network of experts in the fields of real estate, design, construction, operations, and management in order to provide clients and prospective tenants with complete solutions to best meet their needs. We require all of our clients and prospective tenants to go through extensive due diligence in order to be what we consider to be highly sophisticated, credit worthy and experienced operators in their industries. 

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We currently maintain a portfolio of properties that we own, lease, and manage. In addition, we provide direct consultation and support for the development of each property. Development can range from complete architectural design and subsequent build-out, utility installation, property management, facilities management, and state of the art security systems. There are significant challenges that exist when zoning, permitting, and constructing facilities associated with the medical marijuana market. Each state and jurisdiction adopts specific zoning and permitting regulations. We have gained valuable knowledge and experience in this area by successfully completing four major projects in the state of Arizona, a highly regulated market. We believe we can replicate this business model in other states as markets mature and tighter regulations are established. 

&#160; 

The Company generally confirms baseline zoning during the due diligence period and as a contingency of an acquisition. Ideally, properties we consider acquiring are already zoned for use in cultivating marijuana or as a marijuana dispensary. We currently lease building space at five of the six properties in our portfolio, and lease the vacant land at our sixth property. Four of the properties leased to licensed medical marijuana tenants are located in areas where correct zoning was already in place and use as a marijuana facility was already permitted. In these instances, rezoning was not required. Two of the properties were zoned for and leased to licensed medical marijuana dispensaries, and two were zoned for and leased to licensed medical marijuana cultivation sites. 

&#160; 

The process for confirming proper zoning and or acquiring proper permitting for a licensed medical marijuana operator generally takes several months. The confirmation process for the Kingman and Green Valley properties both took approximately one month to complete. The Chino Valley property took approximately three months to confirm the zoning and permitted use for a licensed medical marijuana cultivation facility in that local jurisdiction. The process primarily involves working directly with the local Planning and Zoning Commission or Development Director. Notwithstanding proper zoning and permitted use, we may work with local zoning authorities in order to revise zoning laws. For example, we were recently successful in submitting an approved zoning code amendment to the City of Tempe, whereby the new zoning code allows for an increase in the size of a cultivation facility. That process took approximately six months to complete. The Tempe property is a multi-tenant facility that also leases space to tenants, which have no association to medical marijuana. 

&#160; 

In the event a property is not properly zoned or does not permit use as a marijuana facility, we may work with local authorities to seek changes to existing zoning or permitted use. Our efforts may not be successful. For example, the Gilbert property has not been successfully zoned for a prospective licensed medical marijuana dispensary nor has it been leased to a medical marijuana operator. 

&#160; 

Our vision is to be recognized for creating the standard in property development for emerging industries, while increasing community prosperity and shareholder value. We believe that a strong focus on the development of real estate properties will bring value to the local communities and all of our stakeholders. We have initially established a focus on properties within the licensed medical marijuana industry because we believe there will be increasing demand in this industry, as the national industry continues to evolve. 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to rent buildings that we purchase and to earn rental income. Property acquisitions in 2014 are an indication of the commencement of principal operations. These properties represent assets that have already been identified and zoned for licensed medical marijuana operations. 

&#160; 

We are the sole member of eight limited liability companies: Tempe Industrial Properties LLC, Gilbert Property Management LLC, Green Valley Group LLC, Kingman Property Group LLC, Chino Valley Properties LLC, Zoned Colorado Properties LLC, Zoned Illinois Properties LLC, and Zoned Oregon Properties LLC. 

&#160; 

Four of the entities have completed acquisitions of property as agents of Zoned Properties. Gilbert Property Management LLC, Green Valley Group LLC, Kingman Property Group LLC, and Chino Valley Properties LLC have all acquired land and real property. 

&#160; 

Green Valley Group LLC, Kingman Property Group LLC, and Chino Valley Properties LLC have executed lease agreements at the properties within their respective regions and have begun generating rental revenue. Zoned Properties has executed multiple lease agreements at its Tempe, Arizona properties and has been generating rental revenue. 

&#160; 

We currently own a portfolio of six properties located in the state of Arizona, covering an aggregate of approximately 54.8 acres and having an approximate aggregate market value as of December 31, 2015 of approximately $13.5 million based on most recent appraisals. Additionally, pursuant to a letter of intent, we may acquire an additional property consisting of approximately 1.5 acres located in the state of Colorado. 

&#160; 

Multiple state-licensed operators have approached Zoned Properties from Oregon, Washington, Colorado, New Mexico, and Illinois for consultation and to partner on development and prospective sale-lease back arrangements. We are continuously evaluating these opportunities and exploring financing terms with our funding partners. 

&#160; 

We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the development opportunities that the medical marijuana industry presents without having to deal with the risk of directly cultivating, distributing, or dispensing the product, which is still illegal under federal law. 

&#160; 

Our initial holdings and acquisition targets have been in the state of Arizona. Unlike many other states that have legalized medical marijuana, Arizona&#8217;s program has some of the strictest regulations in the country and limits the number of dispensaries that will be allowed to be open and operate within the state. While there are hundreds of marijuana dispensaries in Denver, Colorado, the entire state of Arizona can have a maximum of 126 operating dispensaries under current legislation, 27 of which are allocated to areas under tribal jurisdictions. Of the remaining 99 dispensaries, licenses to operate 85 have been awarded, and an unknown number of other license applications are pending. Two of our properties in Arizona (in Kingman and Green Valley) are leased to operators that have been awarded dispensary licenses. This limitation on the number of dispensaries permitted to operate in Arizona under current legislation will limit our ability to purchase property in Arizona for lease to dispensary operators. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Opportunity in Arizona 

&#160; 

We are implementing a property acquisition strategy in the State of Arizona that includes placing a variety of operating tenants into long-term lease agreements within the medical marijuana industry. Arizona&#8217;s medical marijuana program is still in its infancy stage. There are ample property management and build-out opportunities for medical marijuana cultivation facilities and dispensaries. We are already working with multiple groups in Arizona that are in need of quality resources or experience to get these facilities operational to serve the growing marketplace. The need for expertise regarding zoned properties was one of the main catalysts in forming our company. While there are many opportunities in Arizona, most investor groups lack the resources, knowledge, and expertise to see these projects through from start to finish, and complete the necessary due diligence required to ensure a sophisticated tenant operator. 

&#160; 

The Opportunity in Additional States 

&#160; 

We have created a business development plan that will allow for expansion into additional states when appropriate. Each state adopts specific and constantly evolving regulations associated with zoning, permitting, and licensing for medical marijuana operators. Zoned Properties will be introducing plans for expansion into additional states over the coming months as further regulations become established. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect to work on a development project with a licensed tenant operator in Colorado and will continue to complete due diligence throughout 2016 on prospective projects in Arizona, Oregon, Washington, and Illinois. 

&#160;

On June 8, 2015, we filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim. On July 9, 2015 and amended and made effective on August 1, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Defendants that, among other things, settles the pending claims and grants mutual general releases. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the settlement: 

&#160;

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We target customers who require assistance with identification, development, and management of sophisticated, safe, and sustainable properties in a variety of emerging industries including the licensed medical marijuana industry. The most significant barrier to success for many industry operators includes distractions from primary business operations. These distractions often include services related to the identification, zoning, permitting, design, and construction of properties. 

&#160; 

We complete significant due diligence on any prospective customer as a prospective tenant operator regardless of industry focus. Credit-worthiness, character, and cash flows are all important traits that contribute to a sophisticated customer for the Company. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

We do not actively market our services using any direct marketing campaigns. Industry reputation, word-of-mouth, and networking are the primary tools used by us to complete the marketing of our services. We maintain an updated website, shareholder presentation, and profile outlining its services. These tools are created for transparency of operations and activities. Our executive management believes the reputation of having integrity is an essential tool for marketing and business development.

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We believe finding properties that are zoned for the specific use of allowing licensed medical marijuana operations may be limited as more competitors enter the market. Several competitors have recently entered the marketplace, including Cannabis-RX, Inc., The Cannabis Business Group, Inc., MJ Holdings, Inc., Home Treasure Finders, Inc., Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. and Grow Condos, Inc. We face significant competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including but not limited to, other public companies with similar business models, independent investors, hedge funds and other real estate investors, hard money lenders, as well as would be clients, marijuana operators themselves, all of whom, who may compete against us in our efforts to acquire real estate zoned for marijuana grow and retail operations. In some instances, we will be competing to acquire real estate with persons who have no interest in the marijuana business, but have identified value in a piece of real estate that we may be interested in acquiring.

We are subject to applicable provisions of federal and state securities laws and to regulations specifically governing the real estate industry, including those governing fair housing and federally backed mortgage programs. Our operations will also be subject to regulations normally incident to business operations, such as occupational safety and health acts, workmen&#8217;s compensation statutes, unemployment insurance legislation and income tax and social security related regulations. Although we will use our best efforts to comply with applicable regulations, we can provide no assurance of our ability to do so, nor can we fully predict the effect of these regulations on our proposed activities. 

&#160; 

In addition, zoning commercial properties for specific purposes, such as medical marijuana dispensaries or cultivation facilities, is subject to specific regulations to the zoning requirements for the city, county and state related to any medical marijuana facility. We expect regulations to get tighter as time goes on.

In November 2010, Arizona voters passed the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act (&#8220;AMMA&#8221;). The AMMA designates the Arizona Department of Health Services (&#8220;ADHS&#8221;) as the licensing authority for the program. ADHS is tasked with issuing Registry Identification Cards (&#8220;RIC&#8221;) to qualifying patients, designated caregivers, and dispensary agents, as well as selecting, registering, and providing oversight for nonprofit medical marijuana dispensaries. With permission from ADHS, qualifying patients or their caregivers may cultivate marijuana if the patient lives more than 25 miles from a dispensary. Currently over 95% of the state is covered within the 25-mile rule, which will eliminate the caregiver model that has been able to survive since the program&#8217;s inception in 2010. 

&#160; 

Qualifying patients can legally possess and purchase medical marijuana under Arizona law as long as they hold a RIC. They acquire their medicine from non-profit medical marijuana dispensaries. These dispensaries acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, sell, and dispense medical marijuana. Arizona is divided into 126 Community Health Assessment Areas (each, a &#8220;CHAA&#8221;) and each CHAA may only have one dispensary located within it. Dispensaries are the only place patients are legally allowed to purchase medical marijuana in Arizona. Arizona law permits the number of CHAAs to change based on the number of registered pharmacies in Arizona. In order to operate, a dispensary must have a Dispensary Registration Certificate and Approval to Operate Certificate from ADHS. The first dispensaries began operation in 2012, and it is anticipated that at maturity, there will be about 112 dispensaries statewide &#8211; one in each CHAA not part of one of Arizona&#8217;s Native American Indian Reservations.

The U.S. Government classifies marijuana as a schedule-I controlled substance. The federal Controlled Substances Act (&#8220;CSA&#8221;) makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana. The Company maintains its operations so as to remain in compliance with the CSA. Even in those jurisdictions in which the use of medical marijuana has been legalized at the state level, its prescription is a violation of federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop. and Gonzales v. Raich that the federal government has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalize its use for medicinal purposes. Federal prosecutions of marijuana crimes, where the operators are acting in accordance with state law are rare, however. This is the result of U.S. Justice Department policies under the current presidential administration that allow states to implement these laws and favor not prosecuting individuals operating in accordance with applicable state law. It is possible, however, that future presidential administrations could reverse the current position regarding enforcement of federal marijuana laws, thereby effectively eliminating the legal marijuana industry.
