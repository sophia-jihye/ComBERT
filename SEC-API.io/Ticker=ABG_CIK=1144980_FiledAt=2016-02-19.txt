 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Asbury Automotive Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 2002, is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States. Our store operations are conducted by our subsidiaries. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned and operated 99 &#32;new vehicle franchises, representing 28 &#32;brands of automobiles at 81 &#32;dealership locations, and 25 &#32;collision centers in the United States. In addition, we owned and operated three stand-alone used vehicle stores under the &#8220;Q auto&#8221; brand name in Florida. Our stores offer an extensive range of automotive products and services, including: 

&#8226; 

new vehicles; 

&#8226; 

used vehicles; 

&#8226; 

parts and service, including: vehicle repair and maintenance services, replacement parts, and collision repair services; and &#160; 

&#8226; 

finance and insurance, including: arranging vehicle financing through third parties and aftermarket products such as extended service contracts, guaranteed asset protection (&#8220;GAP&#8221;) insurance, prepaid maintenance, and credit life and disability insurance. 

Our operations provide a diverse revenue base that we believe mitigates the impact of fluctuations in new vehicle sales volumes and gross profit margins. In addition, our geographic footprint decreases our exposure to regional economic downturns and our brand diversification decreases our exposure to manufacturer-specific risks such as brand perception or production disruptions. While new vehicle sales generate approximately 55% &#32;of our revenue, used vehicles, parts and service, and finance and insurance provide higher profit margins and collectively account for approximately 81% &#32;of our gross profit, and have been historically more stable throughout economic cycles. 

The following charts present the contribution to total revenue and gross profit by each line of business for the year ended December 31, 2015: 

Our new vehicle franchise retail network is made up of dealerships located in 17 &#32;metropolitan markets in nine &#32;states operating primarily under eight locally-branded dealership groups. The following chart provides a detailed breakdown of our markets, brand names, and franchises as of December 31, 2015 :

* Franchise accounted for less than 1% of new vehicle revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

Our new vehicle revenues include new vehicle sales and lease transactions arranged by our dealerships with third-party financial institutions. We believe that leasing provides a number of benefits to our other business lines, including the historical customer loyalty to the leasing dealership for repairs and maintenance services and the fact that lessors typically give the leasing dealership the first option to purchase the off-lease vehicle. 

Used Vehicle Sales 

We sell used vehicles at all of our franchised dealership locations and our stand-alone Q auto stores. Used vehicle sales include the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers (&#8220;used retail&#8221;) and the sale of used vehicles to other dealers at auction (&#8220;wholesale&#8221;) (the terms &#8220;used retail&#8221; and &#8220;wholesale&#8221; collectively referred to as &#8220;used&#8221;). 

Gross profit from the sale of used vehicles depends primarily on the ability of our dealerships to obtain a high quality supply of used vehicles and our use of technology to manage our inventory. Our new vehicle operations typically provide our used vehicle operations with a large supply of trade-ins and off-lease vehicles, which we believe are good sources of high quality used vehicles. We also purchase a portion of our used vehicle inventory at &#8220;open&#8221; auctions and auctions restricted to new vehicle dealers. Additionally, our used vehicle sales benefit from our ability to sell certified pre-owned vehicles from our franchised dealerships. 

Parts and Service 

We provide vehicle repair and maintenance services, sell replacement parts, and recondition used vehicles at all of our dealerships. In addition, we provide collision repair services at our 25 &#32;free-standing collision repair centers that we operate either on the premises of, or in close proximity to, our dealerships. Historically, parts and service revenues have been more stable than those from vehicle sales. Industry-wide, parts and service revenues have consistently increased over time primarily due to the increased cost of maintaining vehicles, the added technical complexity of vehicles, and the increasing number of vehicles on the road. 

The automotive parts and service industry tends to be highly fragmented, with franchised dealerships and independent repair shops competing for this business. We believe, however, that the increased use of advanced technology in vehicles is making it difficult for independent repair shops to compete effectively with franchised dealerships as they may not be able to make the investment necessary to perform major or technical repairs. In an effort to maintain the necessary knowledge to service vehicles and further develop our technician staff, we focus on our internal training and development programs for new and existing technicians. We believe our parts and service business is also well-positioned to benefit from the service work potentially generated through the sale of extended service contracts to customers who purchase new and used vehicles from us, as historically these customers have tended to have their vehicles serviced at the location where they purchase extended service contracts. In addition, our franchised dealerships benefit from manufacturer policies requiring that warranty and recall related repairs be performed at a franchised dealership. We believe that our collision repair centers provide us with an attractive opportunity to grow our business due to the high margins provided by collision repair services and the fact that we are able to source original equipment manufacturer parts from our franchised dealerships. 

Finance and Insurance 

We offer a wide variety of automotive finance and insurance (&#8220;F&#38;I&#8221;) products to our customers. We arrange third-party financing for the sale or lease of vehicles to our customers in exchange for a fee paid to us by the third-party financial institution. We do not directly finance our customers&#8217; vehicle purchases or leases, therefore our exposure to losses in connection with those third-party financing arrangements is limited generally to the fees that we receive. The fees we receive are subject to chargeback, or repayment, to the finance company if a customer defaults or prepays the retail installment contract typically during some limited time period at the beginning of the contract term. We have negotiated agreements with certain lenders pursuant to which we receive additional fees upon reaching a certain volume of business. 

We offer our customers a variety of vehicle protection products in connection with the purchase of vehicles. These products are underwritten and administered by independent third-parties. Under our arrangements with the providers of these products, we primarily sell the products on a straight commission basis. We are subject to chargebacks for insurance contracts due to early termination, default, or prepayment of the contract. In addition, we participate in future profits associated with the performance of the third-party held underlying portfolio for certain products pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements. The following is a brief description of some of the vehicle protection products we offer to our customers: 

&#8226; 

Extended service contracts &#8211; covers certain repair work after the expiration of the manufacturer warranty; 

&#8226; 

GAP debt cancellation &#8211; covers the customer after a total loss for the difference between the value of the vehicle and the outstanding loan or lease obligation after insurance proceeds; 

&#8226; 

Prepaid maintenance &#8211; covers certain routine maintenance work, such as (i) oil changes, (ii) cleaning and adjusting of brakes, (iii) multi-point vehicle inspections, and (iv) tire rotations; and 

&#8226; 

Credit life and disability &#8211; covers the remaining amounts due on an auto loan or a lease in the event of death or disability. 

Recent Developments 

On January 27, 2016, our Board of Directors reset our share repurchase program to $300.0 million in the aggregate, for the repurchase of our common stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions. Any repurchases will be subject to applicable limitations in our debt or other financing agreements that may be in existence from time to time. 

Business Strategy 

We seek to create long-term value for our stockholders by striving to drive operational excellence and deploy capital to the highest returns. To achieve these objectives, we employ the strategies described below. 

Drive Operational Excellence 

Attract and retain the best talent 

We believe that local management of dealership operations enables our retail network to provide market specific responses to sales, customer service, and inventory requirements. The general manager of each of our dealerships is responsible for the operations, personnel, and financial performance of that dealership as well as other day-to-day operations. We believe our general managers&#8217; familiarity with their respective markets enables them to effectively run day-to-day operations, market to customers, and recruit new employees. The general manager of each dealership is supported, in most cases, by a new vehicle sales manager, a used vehicle sales manager, an F&#38;I manager, a parts manager, and a service manager. Our dealership management teams typically have many years of experience in the automotive retail industry. This management structure is complemented by support from our market-based management teams and the corporate office, which we refer to as the Dealership Support Center (&#8220;DSC&#8221;), through our advanced technology solutions, centralized processes, marketing support, and financial oversight. 

Implement best practices and improve productivity 

While new vehicle sales are critical to drawing customers to our dealerships, used vehicles, parts and service, and F&#38;I sales generally provide higher profit margins and account for the majority of our gross profit. In order to maximize the growth of these higher margin businesses, we have discipline-specific executives at the DSC, market and dealership levels who focus on increasing the penetration of current services and expanding the breadth of our offerings to customers through the implementation of best practices and continuous training on our technology solutions throughout our dealership network. In addition, we have marketing initiatives designed to attract customers to our online channels and mobile applications. 

In order to mitigate the impact of significant fluctuations in vehicle sales, we tie management and employee compensation at various operational levels to performance through incentive-based pay systems based on various metrics. We compensate our general managers, department managers, and sales and other dealership personnel with incentive-based pay, using metrics such as dealership profitability, departmental profitability and individual performance, as appropriate. In addition, a portion of management&#8217;s compensation is variable based in nature, including a component of equity compensation tied to our financial performance in comparison to our peer group. 

Provide an exceptional customer experience 

We are focused on providing a high level of customer service and have designed our dealerships&#8217; services to meet the needs of an increasingly sophisticated and demanding automotive consumer. We endeavor to establish relationships that we believe will result in both repeat business and additional business through customer referrals. Furthermore, we provide our dealership managers with appropriate incentives to employ efficient selling approaches, engage in extensive follow-up to develop long-term relationships with customers, and extensively train our sales staff to meet customer needs. We continually evaluate opportunities, and implement appropriate new technologies, to improve the buying experience for our customers, and believe that our ability to share best practices across our multi-jurisdictional platform gives us an advantage over independent dealerships. For example, we have implemented a common customer relations management tool in all of our dealerships to facilitate communications with customers before, during, and after the sale. We continue to invest in technologies designed to improve our sales process and employee productivity, all with the goal of improving the customer experience. In addition, our higher margin parts and service operations are an integral part of our overall approach to customer service, providing an opportunity to foster ongoing relationships and improve customer loyalty. We continue to train our technicians and service advisors on processes and technologies to both educate our customers on their service needs and ensure that our customers continue to receive excellent service. We believe our parts and service business provides us with an opportunity for future growth due to improved customer retention, the added technical complexity of vehicles and the increasing number of vehicles on the road. 

Centralize, streamline, and automate processes 

Our DSC management is responsible for our capital expenditures and determining our operating strategy, while the implementation of our operating strategy rests with our market-based management teams and each dealership management team based on the policies and procedures established by DSC management. DSC management and our market-based management teams continually evaluate the financial and operating results of our dealerships, as well as each dealership&#8217;s geographical location, and from time to time, make decisions to evaluate new technologies and/or processes to further enhance our operational performance. As part of our investment in our IT systems, we have deployed a common dealer management system (&#8220;DMS&#8221;). We believe a single DMS provides the foundation for future efficiencies and creates a more efficient retail operation. We consolidate financial, accounting, and operational data received from our dealerships through customized financial products. Our IT approach enables us to efficiently integrate and aggregate information from our dealerships. Through the combination of a common DMS and our corporate IT products, management has access to the financial, accounting, and operational data at various levels of the organization. In addition, we are in the process of centralizing business processes throughout our organization which we expect will deliver future cost synergies and enhanced performance. 

Leverage our scale and cost structure to improve our operating efficiencies 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We are positioned to leverage our significant scale so that we are able to achieve competitive operating margins by centralizing and streamlining various back-office functions. We are able to improve financial controls and lower servicing costs by maintaining key store-level accounting and administrative activities in our shared service centers, and we leverage our scale to reduce costs related to purchasing certain equipment, supplies, and services through national vendor relationships. 

Deploy Capital to Highest Returns 

We continually evaluate our investment opportunities based upon: (i) our cash and cash equivalents on hand, (ii) the funds that we expect to generate through future operations, (iii) current and expected borrowing availability under our credit facilities and mortgage financings, (iv) amounts in our new vehicle floor plan notes payable offset account, and (v) the potential impact of any contemplated or pending future transactions, including, but not limited to, financings, acquisitions, dispositions or other capital expenditures. 

Seek opportunities to further invest in our business; acquire real estate currently being operated under lease agreements 

We continually evaluate our existing dealership network and seek to make strategic investments which will increase the capacity of our dealerships and improve the customer experience. In addition, we continue to execute on our strategy of selectively acquiring our leased properties where financing rates make it attractive to be an owner. 

Evaluate opportunities to refine our dealership portfolio, including acquiring value added operating assets and dealerships 

We evaluate dealership acquisition opportunities based on market position and geography, brand representation and availability, key personnel, and other factors. We believe our financial position, information technology systems, management structure, and experience positions us to efficiently and opportunistically complete, integrate, and benefit from dealership acquisitions. We also evaluate the financial and operating results of our owned dealerships, as well as each dealership&#8217;s geographical location, and based on various financial and strategic rationales, may make decisions to dispose of dealerships to refine our dealership portfolio. 

Maximize opportunities in the used vehicle market through investments in our &#8220;Q auto&#8221; stand-alone used vehicle stores 

We believe the used vehicle market is changing rapidly and presents a significant opportunity for profitability through technology-driven, customer focused stand-alone used vehicle stores. We currently own and operate stand-alone used vehicle stores under the &#8220;Q auto&#8221; brand name in Florida. Our Q auto stores are designed to market used vehicles to a new generation of buyers seeking a different car buying experience. We are currently focusing our Q auto marketing efforts on a web based strategy designed to capitalize on transparency and a one-price sales process. 

Return capital to stockholders through a share repurchase program and/or dividends 

Our capital allocation decisions are primarily based on our desire to maintain sufficient liquidity and a prudent capital structure. We believe our cash position and borrowing capacity combined with our current and expected future cash generation capability provide us with significant financial flexibility to enhance shareholder value through the repurchase of our common stock and/or dividends. Our share repurchase decisions are based on many factors, including a comparison of the market price of our common stock versus our view of its intrinsic value. 

Competition 

The automotive retail and service industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, and selection. For new vehicle sales, our dealerships compete with other franchised dealerships, primarily in their regions. Our new vehicle store competitors also have franchise agreements with the various vehicle manufactures, and as such, generally obtain new vehicle inventory from vehicle manufactures on the same terms as us. The franchise agreements grant the franchised dealership a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer&#8217;s (or distributor&#8217;s) brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area. State automotive franchise laws restrict competitors from relocating their stores or establishing new stores of a particular vehicle brand within a specified area that is served by our dealership of the same vehicle brand. We rely on our advertising and merchandising, sales expertise, service reputation, strong local branding, and location of our dealerships to assist in the sale of new vehicles. 

Our used vehicle operations compete with other franchised dealerships, non-franchised automotive dealerships, regional and national vehicle rental companies, and Internet-based vehicle brokers for supply and resale of used vehicles. 

We compete with other franchised dealerships to perform warranty and recall related repairs and with other franchised dealerships and independent service centers for non-warranty repair and maintenance services. We compete with other automobile dealers, service stores, and auto parts retailers in our parts operations. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in parts and service sales due to our ability to use factory-approved replacement parts, our competitive prices, our familiarity with manufacturer brands and models, and the quality of our customer service. 

We compete with a broad range of financial institutions in arranging financing for our customers vehicle purchases. In addition, many financial institutions are now offering F&#38;I products through the Internet, which has increased competition and may reduce our profits on certain of these items. We believe that the principal competitive factors in providing financing are convenience, interest rates, and flexibility in contract length. 

Seasonality 

The automobile industry has historically been subject to seasonal variations. Demand for new vehicles is generally highest during the second, third, and fourth quarters of each year and, accordingly, we expect our revenues and operating results to generally be higher during these periods. We typically experience higher sales of luxury vehicles in the fourth quarter, which have higher average selling prices and gross profit per vehicle retailed. Revenues and operating results may be impacted significantly from quarter to quarter by changing economic conditions, vehicle manufacturer incentive programs, or adverse weather events. 

Dealer and Framework Agreements 

Each of our dealerships operates pursuant to a dealer agreement between the dealership and the manufacturer (or in some cases the distributor) of each brand of new vehicles sold and/or serviced at the dealership. The dealer agreements grant the franchised dealership a non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer&#8217;s (or distributor&#8217;s) brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market area. Each dealer agreement also grants our dealerships the right to use the manufacturer&#8217;s trademarks and service marks in connection with the dealerships operations and they also impose numerous operational requirements related to, among other things, the following: 

&#8226; 

inventories of new vehicles and manufacturer replacement parts; &#160; 

&#8226; 

maintenance of minimum net working capital requirements, and in some cases, minimum net worth requirements; &#160; 

&#8226; 

achievement of certain sales and customer satisfaction targets; &#160; 

&#8226; 

advertising and marketing practices; &#160; 

&#8226; 

facilities and signs; &#160; 

&#8226; 

products offered to customers; &#160; 

&#8226; 

dealership management; &#160; 

&#8226; 

personnel training; &#160; 

&#8226; 

information systems; 

&#8226; 

geographic market, including but not limited to requirements to meet sales and service targets within an assigned market area, geographic limitations on where the dealership may locate or advertise, and restrictions on the export of vehicles; and &#160; 

&#8226; 

dealership monthly and annual financial reporting. 

Our dealer agreements are for various terms, ranging from one year to indefinite. We expect that we will be able to renew expiring agreements in the ordinary course of business. However, typical dealer agreements give the manufacturer the right to terminate or the option of non-renewal of the dealer agreement under certain circumstances, subject to applicable state franchise laws, including: 

&#8226; 

insolvency or bankruptcy of the dealership; 

&#8226; 

failure to adequately operate the dealership or to maintain required capitalization levels; 

&#8226; 

impairment of the reputation or financial condition of the dealership; 

&#8226; 

change of ownership or management of the dealership without manufacturer consent; 

&#8226; 

certain extraordinary corporate transactions such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets without manufacturer consent; 

&#8226; 

failure to complete facility upgrades required by the manufacturer or agreed to by the dealer; 

&#8226; 

failure to maintain any license, permits or authorization required to conduct the dealership&#8217;s business; 

&#8226; 

conviction of a dealer/manager or owner for certain crimes; or 

&#8226; 

material breach of other provisions of a dealer agreement. 

Notwithstanding the terms of any dealer agreement, the states in which we operate have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide that it is unlawful for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise unless &#8220;good cause&#8221; exists. 

In addition to requirements under dealer agreements, we are subject to provisions contained in supplemental agreements, framework agreements, dealer addenda and manufacturers&#8217; policies, collectively referred to as &#8220;framework agreements.&#8221; Framework agreements impose requirements on us in addition to those described above. Such agreements also define other standards and limitations, including: 

&#8226; 

company-wide performance criteria; 

&#8226; 

capitalization requirements; 

&#8226; 

limitations on changes in our ownership or management; 

&#8226; 

limitations on the number of a particular manufacturer&#8217;s franchises owned by us; 

&#8226; 

restrictions or prohibitions on our ability to pledge the stock of certain of our subsidiaries; and 

&#8226; 

conditions for consent to proposed acquisitions, including sales and customer satisfaction criteria, as well as limitations on the total local, regional, and national market share percentage that would be represented by a particular manufacturer&#8217;s franchises owned by us after giving effect to a proposed acquisition. 

Some dealer agreements and framework agreements grant the manufacturer the right to terminate or not renew our dealer and framework agreements, or to compel us to divest our dealerships, for a number of reasons, including default under the agreement, any unapproved change of control (which specific changes vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, but which include material changes in the composition of our Board of Directors during a specified time period, the acquisition of 5% or more of our voting stock by another vehicle manufacturer or distributor, the acquisition of 20% or more of our voting stock by third parties, and the acquisition of an ownership interest sufficient to direct or influence management and policies), or certain other unapproved events (including certain extraordinary corporate transactions such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets). Triggers of the clauses are often based upon actions by our stockholders and are generally outside of our control. Some of our dealer agreements and framework agreements also give the manufacturer a right of first refusal if we propose to sell any dealership representing the manufacturer&#8217;s brands to a third-party. These agreements may also attempt to limit the protections available under applicable state laws and require us to resolve disputes through binding arbitration. For additional information, please refer to the risk factor captioned &#8220;We are dependent upon our relationships with the 

manufacturers of vehicles that we sell and are subject to restrictions imposed by, and significant influence from, these vehicle manufacturers. Any of these restrictions or any changes or deterioration of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.&#8221; 

Our framework agreements with certain manufacturers contain provisions that, among other things, attempt to limit the protections available to dealers under these laws. If these laws are repealed in the states in which we operate, manufacturers may be able to terminate our franchises without providing advance notice, an opportunity to cure or a showing of good cause. Without the protection of these laws, it may also be more difficult for us to renew our dealer agreements upon expiration. Changes in laws that provide manufacturers the ability to terminate our dealer agreements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, if a manufacturer seeks protection from creditors in bankruptcy, courts have held that the federal bankruptcy laws may supersede these laws, resulting in either the termination, non-renewal or rejection of franchises by such manufacturers, which, in turn, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For additional information, please refer to the risk factor captioned &#8220;If state laws that protect automotive retailers are repealed, weakened, or superseded by our framework agreements with manufacturers, our dealerships will be more susceptible to termination, non-renewal or renegotiation of their dealer agreements which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.&#8221; 

Regulations 

We operate in a highly regulated industry. In every state in which we operate, we must obtain one or more licenses issued by state regulatory authorities in order to operate our business. In addition, we are subject to numerous complex federal, state, and local laws regulating the conduct of our business, including those relating to our sales, operations, finance and insurance, advertising, and employment practices. These laws and regulations include state franchise laws and regulations, consumer protection laws, privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, and other extensive laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers. These laws also include federal and state wage and hour, anti-discrimination, and other laws governing employment practices. 

Our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, leasing laws, installment finance laws, usury laws, and other installment state and leasing laws and regulations. Some U.S. states regulate finance fees and charges that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us or by our stores by individuals or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages, fines or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of our license to conduct store operations. 

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with broad regulatory powers. Although automotive dealers are generally excluded from the CFPB&#8217;s regulatory authority, we are required to comply with regulations applicable to privacy notices, and the CFPB has announced its intention to regulate automotive financing activities through its regulation of automotive finance companies and other financial institutions that service the automotive industry. The CFPB has issued regulatory guidance instructing financial institutions to monitor dealer loans for potential discrimination resulting from the system used to compensate dealers for assisting in the customer financing transaction. The CFPB has instructed lenders that, if discrimination is found, the lender would be required to change dealer compensation practices. In addition, the CFPB has announced its intention to regulate the sale of other finance and insurance products. The Federal Trade Commission has certain regulatory authority over automotive dealers and has implemented an enforcement initiative relating to the advertising practices of automotive dealers. For additional information, please refer to the risk factor captioned &#8220;Our operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations. If we are found to be in purported violation of or subject to liabilities under any of these laws or regulations, or if new laws or regulations are enacted that adversely affect our operations, our business, our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could suffer.&#8221; 

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations 

We are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into water, air emissions, storage of petroleum substances and chemicals, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, remediation of various types of contamination, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment. For example and without creating an exhaustive list: as with automobile dealerships generally, and service and parts and collision repair center operations in particular, our business involves the generation, use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances and wastes and the use of above ground and underground storage tanks (ASTs and USTs). Operations involving the management of wastes and the use of ASTs and USTs are subject to requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, analogous state statutes, and their implementing regulations. Pursuant to these laws, federal and state environmental agencies have established approved methods for handling, storing, treating, transporting, and disposing of regulated substances and wastes with which we must comply. We also are subject to laws and regulations governing responses to any releases of contamination 

at or from our facilities or at facilities that receive our hazardous wastes for treatment or disposal. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) and similar state statutes, can impose strict and joint and several liability for cleanup costs on those that are considered to have contributed to the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance.&#8221; We also are subject to the Clean Water Act, analogous state statutes, and their implementing regulations which, among other things, prohibit discharges of pollutants into regulated waters without permits, require containment of potential discharges of oil or hazardous substances, and require preparation of spill contingency plans. Currently, we are not aware of any non-compliance with these or any other environmental requirements applicable to our operations, nor are we aware of any material remedial liabilities to which we are subject. 

We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain all necessary environmental permits. We believe that our operations currently are being conducted in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws. From time to time we may experience incidents and encounter conditions that are not in compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We occasionally receive notices from environmental agencies regarding potential violations of environmental laws or regulations. In such cases, we work with the agencies to address any issues and to implement appropriate corrective action when necessary. However, none of our dealerships has been subject to any material environmental liabilities in the past, nor do we know of any fact or condition that would result in any material environmental liabilities being incurred in the future. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 8,600 full-time and part-time employees, none of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

Insurance 

Due to the inherent risk in the automotive retail industry, our operations expose us to a variety of liabilities. These risks generally require significant levels of insurance covering liabilities such as claims from employees, customers, or other third-parties for personal injury and property related losses occurring in the course of our operations. We may be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of federal and state laws or regulatory environments. Further, the automobile retail industry is subject to substantial risk of real and personal property loss due to the significant concentration of property values located at the various dealership locations. 

Our insurance programs include multiple umbrella policies with a total per occurrence and aggregate limit of $100 million. We are self-insured for certain employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for individual claims. We have large deductible insurance programs in place for workers compensation, property, and general liability claims. 

Provisions for retained losses and deductibles are made by charges to expense based upon periodic evaluations of the estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims. The insurance companies that underwrite our insurance require that we secure certain of our obligations for deductible reimbursements with collateral. Our collateral requirements are set by the insurance companies and, to date, have been satisfied by posting surety bonds, letters of credit, and/or cash deposits. Our collateral requirements may change from time to time based on, among other things, our claims experience.
