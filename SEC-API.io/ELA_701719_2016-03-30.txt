 ITEM 1. BUSINESS . 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We were originally formed as a corporation in the State of Nevada on September 16, 1965 under the name &#8220;Canyon State Mining Corporation of Nevada.&#8221; After several name changes through the years, in 2005 we changed our name to DGSE Companies, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 15850 Dallas Parkway, Suite 140, Dallas, Texas 75248. Our telephone number is 972-587-4049. Our primary commercial internet addresses are www.DGSE.com and www.CGDEinc.com, and we also maintain www.DGSECompanies.com primarily as a corporate information and investor relations website. We hold registered trademarks for the company name &#8220;Dallas Gold &#38; Silver Exchange&#8221; and the corresponding logo.

&#160;

We buy and sell jewelry, diamonds, fine watches, rare coins and currency, precious metal bullion products, scrap gold, silver, platinum and palladium as well as collectibles and other valuables. Our customers include individual consumers, dealers and institutions throughout the United States. Our operations are organized around two primary types of customers, retail customers and wholesale customers.

Retail 

&#160; 

As of the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (&#8220;Fiscal 2015&#8221;), our products and services were marketed through eight retail locations in Illinois, South Carolina, and Texas. During the year ended December 31, 2014 (&#8220;Fiscal 2014&#8221;), we closed our Southern Bullion Coin &#38; Jewelry (&#8220;Southern Bullion&#8221;) operations, which included locations in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee. In Fiscal 2015, we closed three locations in the Dallas-Fort Worth (&#8220;DFW&#8221;) area and one in Summerville, South Carolina, as part of our reconfiguration of that market. Our retail locations operate under a variety of banners, including Charleston Gold &#38; Diamond Exchange, Chicago Gold &#38; Diamond Exchange (formerly Bullion Express), and Dallas Gold &#38; Silver Exchange, and are supported by websites at www.CGDEinc.com and www.DGSE.com.

&#160;

Our retail footprint has evolved significantly in recent years, growing and contracting largely in line with changes in the precious metals market. In 2011, as we acquired Southern Bullion, precious metal prices hit all-time highs, but by 2012 the markets had softened significantly. During the year ended December 31, 2013 (&#8220;Fiscal 2013&#8221;), the precious metals market experienced a significant downturn, as evidenced by a nearly 30% decrease in the price of an ounce of gold, as measured by London PM Fix, between January 1 and December 31, 2013. While prices were more stable in 2014, they remained well below levels reached in 2011. This downturn significantly changed the economics of our business, and led us to further evaluate the number and locations of retail stores, resulting in the closure of all Southern Bullion locations in the first half of Fiscal 2014. The volatility in the price per ounce of gold continued in Fiscal 2015, which decreased 11.5% as compared to Fiscal 2014.

&#160;

As noted above, in early 2015, we also made the decision to close three of our DFW stores and one in South Carolina. Notwithstanding a significant uptick in precious metals pricing, we do not expect to open incremental retail locations in the next 12 months. However, we have recently embarked on a project to reconfigure our retail presence in DFW, which we expect will result in DGSE having fewer, but larger stores in the area. In January 2016, we opened a store in a new 4,400 square foot retail space in Euless, Texas, which will replace at least two much smaller locations in the western part of DFW. In late December 2015, we signed a lease on a new 15,120 square foot retail space in Dallas, Texas, which will replace our main showroom and potentially two smaller locations in the eastern part of the DFW area. We expect to move into this location during the summer of 2016.

&#160; 

Wholesale 

&#160; 

Our Fairchild International (&#8220;Fairchild&#8221;) division is one of the country&#8217;s leading dealers of pre-owned fine watches. Fairchild supplies over 1,100 regional jewelry stores across the country, with pre-owned Rolexes and aftermarket Rolex accessories such as bands, bezels and dials. A dealer-only online catalog of Fairchild&#8217;s fine watch inventory can be found at our web site at www.Fairchildwatches.com.

&#160;

In addition to our Fairchild operations, we transact a significant amount of business with wholesalers and other companies in our industry. This wholesale transactional activity occurs at industry-specific trade shows held periodically throughout the year, during in-person and telephonic sales calls, and on industry trade websites that facilitate wholesale trades for our industry.

&#160;

Products and Services

&#160; 

Jewelry 

&#160;

We sell items in every major jewelry category, including bridal jewelry, fashion jewelry, custom-made jewelry, diamonds and other gemstones, watches and findings (jewelry components).

&#160;

A substantial percentage of our jewelry inventory is purchased directly from our customers at one of our retail locations. These jewelry items and fine watches are then cleaned, serviced and repaired by our experienced jewelers so that they are in a like-new condition and suitable for resale.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The higher-quality diamonds and gemstones we purchase are certified by the Gemological Institute of America (&#8220;GIA&#8221;) and other third-party certifying authorities for an independent assessment of their quality. This process aides us in readily reselling these stones individually or as a component of our custom bridal and fashion jewelry. Mid-quality diamonds and gemstones are often utilized in custom fashion jewelry or packaged with lower quality stones and sold to wholesalers across the country and abroad.

&#160;

We maintain relationships with numerous commercial consignment vendors across the country, which supply us with new and estate jewelry, which supplements jewelry that we purchase over the counter and enhances our overall jewelry offering. During Fiscal 2015, we began accepting consignment merchandise from individuals. Any sales made from this consignment jewelry stock are settled with our commercial and individual consignment vendors on a monthly or quarterly basis.

&#160;

We also maintain jewelry repair centers in three of our locations and accept repair, polishing and service orders through all of our retail locations.

&#160;

Jewelry retailing is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete for jewelry sales primarily against specialty jewelers such as Zales, Jared, and Kay&#8217;s, as well as other retailers that sell jewelry including department stores, discount stores, apparel outlets, and internet retailers. The jewelry category competes for a share of our customers&#8217; disposable income with other consumer sectors such as electronics, clothing and furniture, as well as travel and restaurants. This competition for consumers&#8217; discretionary spending is particularly relevant to gift giving, and also has some relevance with respect to bridal jewelry (e.g. engagement, wedding, and anniversary).

&#160; 

Bullion 

&#160;

Our bullion trading operation buys and sells all forms of gold, silver, platinum and palladium precious metals products, including United States and other government coins, private mint medallions, wafers, art bars and trade unit bars. Retail bullion transactions are conducted with individual consumers at all of our store locations and online at www.USBullionExchange.com. Wholesale bullion transactions are conducted through our main bullion trading operation in Dallas, Texas, which maintains numerous vendor relationships with major industry wholesalers, mints and institutions.

&#160;

Bullion products are purchased and sold based on current market pricing for precious metals. This bullion inventory is subject to market value changes created by the underlying commodity markets. We periodically enter into futures contracts and utilize offsetting customer orders in order to hedge our exposure against changes in market prices. While we believe that we have effectively managed the commodity risk associated with our bullion activity, there are several national and international factors, which are out of our control but may affect margins, customer demand and transactional volume in our bullion business. These factors include but are not limited to: U.S. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, global economic uncertainty, governmental and private mint supply and other factors.

&#160;

Elemetal, LLC (&#8220;Elemetal&#8221;) is our principal supplier of bullion products. Several other bullion wholesalers compete for our business on a regular basis.

&#160; 

Rare Coins, Currency and Collectibles 

&#160;

We buy and sell most numismatic items, including rare coins, currency, medals, tokens and other collectibles. The majority of our rare coin, currency and collectible revenue is derived from individual customers selling their collections to us. We then consolidate these collections and resell them through our retail activities, on the wholesale market through national trade shows, through in-person and telephonic sales calls, and on industry trade websites.

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Scrap 

&#160;

Individual and wholesale customers sell their unwanted jewelry and other precious metals items to us at all of our retail locations. After we have purchased these valuables, they are processed at a centralized clearing house, where expert jewelers, gemologists and watchmakers sort items into three main resale categories: Retail Appropriate, Wholesale Appropriate and Refiner Appropriate. Those items deemed appropriate for resale at one of our retail locations are cleaned, serviced and repaired by our experienced jewelers so that they are in a like-new condition. The vast majority of these items are then individually tagged, placed on our e-commerce websites and sent to one of our retail locations for future retail sales. Other items that are not appropriate for our retail locations are grouped into wholesale lots and liquidated at national trade shows or through in-person dealer to dealer transactions. Items that are not appropriate for either retail or wholesale purposes are sold to the refiner.

&#160;

Elemetal is also the principal refiner of our scrap related products. Several other refiners compete for our business on a regular basis.

&#160; 

Relationship with Elemetal, LLC. 

&#160;

Elemetal is a global precious metals conglomerate based in Dallas, Texas. Its principal holdings include: Elemetal Refining, LLC (formerly known as OPM Metals or OPM), the Ohio-based, largest American-owned refiner of &#8220;good delivery&#8221; gold and silver; Elemetal Direct, a Texas-based wholesale dealer of precious metals; Elemetal Capital, LLC, a leading market maker in the bullion and precious metals industries; Provident Precious Metals LLC, an online retailer of bullion and precious metal products; and Elemetal Recycling, LLC (formerly known as Echo Environmental), a Texas-based firm focusing on electronic waste recycling and precious metal recovery.

&#160;

Through a series of transactions beginning in 2010, NTR Metals, LLC (&#8220;NTR&#8221;) became the largest shareholder of our Common Stock. In April 2012, NTR announced its merger with OPM, the largest American-owned refiner of &#8220;good delivery&#8221; gold and silver. The combined company was originally called Global Metals Holdings, LLC, and has since been rechristened as Elemetal. In January 2013, NTR announced it would contribute 4,393,142 of its shares of our Common Stock to Elemetal, in exchange for ownership units in Elemetal. NTR also agreed to contribute its option to buy 5,000,000 additional shares of DGSE.

&#160;

In addition to being our largest shareholder, Elemetal is our primary supplier for bullion products and is our primary refiner of recyclable precious metal. These and other transactions with Elemetal are more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, Related Party Transactions.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing

&#160;

In Fiscal 2015, our advertising activities continued to rely on local television, radio, print, and digital media. Marketing activities centered on each of the major business categories, emphasizing our broad array of products, expertise, and price advantages compared to our local and regional competition. In Fiscal 2015, we spent $1,571,199 on advertising and marketing in our continuing operations, a 31% year-over-year decrease. Our advertising and marketing spending represents costs for traditional and digital media, in-store displays, brochures and informational pamphlets, production fees, and other related items.

&#160;

In 2016, we anticipate our radio and digital presence to be a substantially more important part of our marketing strategy. As digital commerce platforms continue double-digit growth, we re-launched our website in 2015 to include what we believe is a state-of-the-art e-commerce platform. Our updated web platform unifies our broad array of inventory across every store and allows for online ordering and in-store pickup of items. The website is also designed to be viewed on a variety of platforms across a multitude of digital devices. We believe this enhanced web platform also allows for personalization of the shopping experience, including recommending inventory, and delivers a seamless digital experience for product research, purchase, and social sharing. Additionally, we anticipate that digital media and marketing will play an increasingly larger role in our overall advertising mix. We anticipate that social interaction and engagement, email marketing programs, and expert video tutorials will provide a stronger connection to our jewelry, bullion, and rare coin customers.

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

The retail and wholesale jewelry business is seasonal. We realized 27% and 35% of our annual jewelry sales in the fourth quarters of Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively.

&#160;

While our bullion, scrap and rare coin businesses are not as seasonal, we believe they are directly impacted by several national and international factors which are out of our control. These factors may affect margins, customer demand and transactional volume in our bullion and rare coin business. These factors include but are not limited to: U.S. Federal Reserve policies, inflation rates, global economic uncertainty, governmental and private mint supply and other factors.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We operate in a highly competitive industry where competition is based on a combination of price, service and product quality. Our jewelry and scrap activities compete with numerous other competitors in the markets in which we operate. These competitors include big box retailers, national jewelry chains, individual jewelry stores, web-only entities, pawn shops and other businesses who attempt to enter this industry as an add-on to their existing business lines.

&#160;

The bullion and rare coin industry in which we compete is dominated by substantially larger enterprises, which retail and wholesale bullion, rare coin and other precious metal products through traditional store front locations and via the internet.

&#160;

We compete in these industries by taking advantage of core competencies in the following areas:

&#160;

&#8226; Pricing &#8211; We believe we offer competitive or industry leading price points across all of our product lines. &#8226; Selection &#8211; We offer a wide variety of inventory in each one of our product lines. We believe this diverse selection allows us to market to the widest variety of potential clients while immediately delivering items that competitors may have to back order. &#8226; Brick and Mortar Locations &#8211; We seek retail locations that simultaneously meet our client&#8217;s geographical needs while also providing a safe and attractive location to conduct business. &#8226; Web Portals &#8211; Our websites allow clients who are located both inside and outside of our brick and mortar footprint to conduct business with us in an efficient and cost effective manner. &#8226; Staff &#8211; We employ a staff of experts with many years of experience in their respective fields, such as jewelry, diamonds, premium and vintage watches, bullion and numismatic coins. We believe that when coupled with our corporate training programs, management structure and incentives for continuing education, our client facing sales associates are among the nation&#8217;s best. &#8226; Brand &#8211; We have spent millions of dollars over several decades advertising our brands and have spent countless hours reinforcing that marketing message with our clients on an individual basis. As a result, we believe that current and prospective clients place a significant amount of trust in our brands. Additionally, we believe that consumers have additional confidence in our brands as a result of our public company status. &#8226; Market Maker &#8211;While many of our competitors limit their participation to either buying or selling in certain markets, we both buy and sell at a retail level across all of our product lines and in all markets, creating a unique service for our retail customers. Our model makes it easy for a customer to upgrade to a higher quality watch, diamond or jewelry item from one they already own, to move a precious metal investment easily into a different metal, or to receive cash for an unused or unwanted item. &#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 69 individuals, 68 of whom were full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our current relations with employees are good. Our management follows the policy of keeping employees informed of decisions and encourages and implements employee suggestions whenever practicable.

Available Information 

&#160;

Our primary commercial websites are located at www.DGSE.com and www.CGDEinc.com. Through the &#8220;DGSE Companies&#8221; section of these websites, as well as through www.DGSECompanies.com, we make available free of charge all of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and press releases. In addition, a complete copy of our Business Conduct and Ethics Policy, our Related Person Transactions Policy, our Whistleblower Policy and charters for our Audit Committee, our Compliance, Governance and Nominating Committee, and our Compensation Committee are available through www.DGSECompanies.com, as well as information on how to communicate with our Board of Directors (our &#8220;Board&#8221;).

&#160; 

Discontinued Operations 

&#160;

In February 2014, we elected to discontinue the operations of six of our Southern Bullion locations and in April 2014, we elected to discontinue the operations of the 17 remaining Southern Bullion locations, due to the lack of profitability and management's belief that it was unlikely that profitability would be reached in the foreseeable future. The significant change in the precious metals market in 2013, including a 30% decline in the spot price of gold since the acquisition of Southern Bullion in 2011, had a disproportionately negative impact on the customer traffic, transactional volume and profitability of the Southern Bullion operations. As a result, during 2013, the Southern Bullion operations generated a net loss of approximately $1.9 million. The operating results for all Southern Bullion operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014.

&#160; 

Research &#38; Development 

&#160;

We do not actively engage in research and development activities. As a result, we did not expend any amounts in Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 on research and development.
