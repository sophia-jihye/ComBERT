Reverse Stock Split 

&#160; 

On May 4, 2015, the Company&#8217;s Shareholders and the Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split pursuant to which all classes of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at the close of business on such date were combined and reconstituted into a smaller number of shares of common stock in a ratio of 1 share of common stock for every 5 shares of common stock (&#8220;1-for-5 reverse stock split&#8221;). The 1-for-5 reverse stock split was effective as of close of business on May 7, 2015 and the Company&#8217;s stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on May 8, 2015. 

&#160; 

The reverse stock split reduced the number of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock currently outstanding at that time from approximately 22 million shares to approximately 4.4 million shares. Proportional adjustments have been made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Company&#8217;s outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants, restricted stock awards, convertible notes and stock options, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company&#8217;s Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan. Upon the effectiveness of the 1-for-5 reverse stock split, each five shares of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001. The Company did not issue any fractional shares in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, fractional share interests were rounded up to the next largest whole share. The reverse stock split does not modify the rights or preferences of the common stock. The number of authorized shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock remains at 50 million shares and the par value remains $0.001. 

&#160; 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the 1-for-5 reverse stock split. 

&#160; 

Liquidity 

&#160; 

The Company has incurred operating losses and used cash in its operating activities for the past several years. Cash was used to fund acquisitions to broaden our geographic footprint, develop new products, and build infrastructure. In fiscal 2015, the Company initiated a restructuring plan that included a reduction of workforce and office space, which significantly reduced operating expenses. Restructuring activities continued in fiscal 2016 with more renegotiations of office space. The Company&#8217;s management believes it will have an appropriate cost structure for its anticipated sales in fiscal 2017. Management believes that operating expenses will be reduced to the point where the Company can drive positive Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation charges and other onetime charges) . As such, management believes that the Company will provide sufficient cash flows to fund its operations in the ordinary course of business through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that the anticipated sales level will be achieved. 

&#160; 

In June 2016, the Company replaced its Loan and Security Agreement with BridgeBank (the &#8220;Bridgebank Agreement&#8221;) with a new Loan and Security Agreement with Heritage Bank of Commerce (&#8220;Heritage Agreement&#8221; or &#8220;Loan Agreement&#8221;). The Heritage Agreement has a term of 24 months and will expire on June 9, 2018. The Loan Agreement currently provides for $2.5 million of revolving credit advances and may be used for acquisitions and working capital purposes. The credit advances may not exceed the monthly borrowing base capacity, which will fluctuate based on monthly accounts receivable balances. The Company may request credit advances if the borrowing capacity is more than the current outstanding loan advance, and must pay down the outstanding loan advance if it exceeds the borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an outstanding balance under the Loan Agreement of $2.1 million. 

&#160; 

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

&#160; &#160; 

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s fiscal year end is September 30. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

&#160;

Use of Estimates 

&#160; 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The most significant estimates included in these financial statements are the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term assets, including intangibles, goodwill and deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, amounts of revenue to be recognized on service contracts in progress, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

&#160; The complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the use of the proportional performance model affect the amount of revenue and related expenses reported in the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Internal and external factors can affect the Company&#8217;s estimates. 

&#160; 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

&#160; 

The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. 

&#160; 

Concentration of Credit Risk, Significant Customers, and Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

&#160; 

Financial instruments, which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company&#8217;s cash is maintained with what management believes to be a high-credit quality financial institution. At times, deposits held at this bank may exceed the federally insured limits. Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Company&#8217;s deposits are financially sound and have minimal credit risk. Risks associated with cash and cash equivalents are mitigated by the Company&#8217;s investment policy, which limits the Company&#8217;s investing of excess cash into only money market mutual funds. 

&#160; 

The Company extends credit to customers on an unsecured basis in the normal course of business. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers&#8217; financial condition and limits the amount of credit when deemed necessary. Accounts receivable are carried at original invoice less an estimate for doubtful accounts based on a review of all outstanding amounts. The Company had one customer that contributed 10.2% of revenue for fiscal 2016. No customer contributed more than 10% of total revenue in fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

The Company has no significant off-balance sheets risks such as foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, option contracts or other foreign hedging agreements. 

&#160; 

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 

&#160; 

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. For all customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due, current business environment and its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Company&#8217;s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company had two customers that had an accounts receivable balance of greater than 10% of total accounts receivable at September 30, 2016. There were no customers that had an accounts receivable balance greater than 10% at September 30, 2015.

Revenue Recognition 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

The Company enters into arrangements to sell digital engagement services (professional services), software licenses or combinations thereof. Revenue is categorized into: (i) Digital Engagement Services; (ii) Subscriptions and Perpetual Licenses; and (iii) Managed Service Hosting. 

&#160; 

The Company recognizes revenue as required by the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification. Revenue is generally recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) delivery has occurred or the services have been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of the fees is reasonably assured. Billings made or payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period these services are provided. 

&#160; 

The Company maintains a reseller channel to supplement our direct sales force for our iAPPS platform. Resellers are generally located in territories where the Company does not have a direct sales force. Customers generally sign a license agreement directly with the Company. Revenue from perpetual licenses sold through resellers is recognized upon delivery to the end user as long as evidence of an arrangement exists, collectability is probable, and the fee is fixed and determinable. Revenue for subscription licenses is recognized monthly as the services are delivered. &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Digital Engagement Services 

&#160; 

Digital engagement services include professional services primarily related to the Company&#8217;s web development solutions that address specific customer needs such as digital strategy, information architecture and usability engineering, .Net development, rich media development, back end integration, search engine optimization, quality assurance and project management. 

&#160; 

Digital engagement services are contracted for on either a fixed price or time and materials basis. For its fixed price engagements, after assigning the relative selling price to the elements of the arrangement, the Company applies the proportional performance model (if not subject to contract accounting) to recognize revenue based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion. The Company has determined that labor costs are the most appropriate measure to allocate revenue among reporting periods, as they are the primary input when providing application development services. Customers are invoiced monthly or upon the completion of milestones. For milestone based projects, since milestone pricing is based on expected hourly costs and the duration of such engagements is relatively short, this input approach principally mirrors an output approach under the proportional performance model for revenue recognition on such fixed priced engagements. For time and materials contracts, revenues are recognized as the services are provided. 

&#160; 

Digital engagement services also include retained professional services contracted for on an &#8220;on call&#8221; basis or for a certain amount of hours each month. Such arrangements generally provide for a guaranteed availability of a number of professional services hours each month on a &#8220;use it or lose it&#8221; basis. For retained professional services sold on a stand-alone basis the Company recognizes revenue as the services are delivered or over the term of the contractual retainer period. These arrangements do not require formal customer acceptance and do not grant any future right to labor hours contracted for but not used. 

&#160; 

Managed Service Hosting 

&#160; 

Managed service hosting includes hosting arrangements that provide for the use of certain hardware and infrastructure for those customers who do not wish to host the Company&#8217;s applications independently. Hosting agreements are either annual or month-to-month arrangements that provide for termination for convenience by either party generally upon 30-days&#8217; notice. Revenue is recognized monthly as the hosting services are delivered. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with managed hosting services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the hosting period or the expected lives of customer relationships. The Company will continue to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as the Company gains more experience with customer contract renewals.

&#160;

Subscriptions and Perpetual Licenses 

&#160; 

The Company licenses its software on either a perpetual or subscription basis. Customers who license the software on a perpetual basis receive rights to use the software for an indefinite time period and an option to purchase post-customer support (&#8220;PCS&#8221;). For arrangements that consist of a perpetual license and PCS, as long as Vendor Specific Objective Evidence (&#8220;VSOE&#8221;) exists for the PCS, then PCS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period of performance and the perpetual license is recognized on a residual basis. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 

&#160; 

Customers may also license the software on a subscription basis, which can be described as &#8220;Software as a Service&#8221; or &#8220;SaaS&#8221;. SaaS is a model of software deployment where an application is hosted as a service provided to customers across the Internet. Subscription agreements include access to the Company&#8217;s software application via an internet connection, the related hosting of the application, and PCS. Customers receive automatic updates and upgrades, and new releases of the products as soon as they become available. Customers cannot take possession of the software. Subscription agreements are either annual or month-to-month arrangements that provide for termination for convenience by either party upon 90 days&#8217; notice. Revenue is recognized monthly as the services are delivered. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of subscription period or the expected lives of customer relationships. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as the Company gains more experience with customer contract renewals. 

&#160; 

Multiple Element Arrangements &#160; 

&#160; 

In accounting for multiple element arrangements, we follow either ASC Topic 605-985 Revenue Recognition Software or ASC Topic 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements , as applicable. &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

In accordance with Revenue Recognition: Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangement. , each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met (1) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the delivered item is considered probable and within our control. If the deliverables do not meet the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting then they are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion. The accounting guidance also requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The accounting guidance also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. We determine selling price using VSOE, if it exists; otherwise, we use Third-party Evidence (&#8220;TPE&#8221;). If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a unit of accounting, we use Estimated Selling Price (&#8220;ESP&#8221;). 

&#160; 

VSOE is generally limited to the price at which we sell the element in a separate stand-alone transaction. TPE is determined based on the prices charged by the Company&#8217;s competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately. It is difficult for us to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing, so we may not be able to substantiate TPE. If we cannot establish selling price based on VSOE or TPE then we will use ESP. ESP is derived by considering the selling price for similar services and our ongoing pricing strategies. The selling prices used in the Company&#8217;s allocations of arrangement consideration are analyzed at minimum on an annual basis and more frequently if our business necessitates a more timely review. The Company has determined that the Company has VSOE on our SaaS offerings, certain application development services, managed hosting services, and PCS because we have evidence of these elements sold on a stand-alone basis. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data) 

&#160;

&#160; When the Company licenses its software on a perpetual basis in a multiple element arrangement that arrangement typically includes PCS and application development services. In assessing the hierarchy of relative selling price for PCS, we have determined that VSOE is established for PCS. VSOE for PCS is based on the price of PCS when sold separately, which has been established via annual renewal rates. Similarly, when the Company licenses its software on a perpetual basis in a multiple element arrangement that also includes managed service hosting (&#8220;hosting&#8221;), we have determined that VSOE is established for hosting based on the price of the hosting when sold separately, which has been established based on renewal rates of the hosting contract. Revenue recognition for perpetual licenses sold with application development services are considered on a case by case basis. The Company has not established VSOE for perpetual licenses or fixed price development services and therefore in accordance with ASC Topic 605-985, when perpetual licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements including application development services where VSOE for the services has not been established, the license revenue is deferred and recognized using contract accounting. The Company has determined that services are not essential to the functionality of the software and it has the ability to make estimates necessary to apply proportional performance method. In those cases where perpetual licenses are sold in a multiple element arrangement that includes application development services where VSOE for the services has been established, the license revenue is recognized under the residual method and the application services are recognized upon delivery. &#160;

In determining VSOE for the digital engagement services element, the separability of the services from the software license and the value of the services when sold on a standalone basis are considered. &#160; The Company also considers the categorization of the services, the timing of when the services contract was signed in relation to the signing of the perpetual license contract and delivery of the software, and whether the services can be performed by others. The Company has concluded that its application development services are not required for the customer to use the product but, rather enhance the benefits that the software can bring to the customer. In addition, the services provided do not result in significant customization or modification of the software and are not essential to its functionality, and can also be performed by the customer or a third party. If an application development services arrangement does qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the perpetual license on a residual basis. If an application development services arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the perpetual license under the proportional performance model as described above. 

&#160; 

When subscription arrangements are sold with application development services, the Company uses its judgment as to whether the application development services qualify as a separate unit of accounting. When subscription service arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the Company allocates arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price model in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) VSOE when available; (ii) TPE if VSOE is not available; and (iii) ESP if neither VSOE or TPE is available. For those subscription arrangements sold with multiple elements whereby the application development services do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the application services revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Subscriptions also include a PCS component, and the Company has determined that the two elements cannot be separated and must be recognized as one unit over the applicable service period. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription arrangements are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the hosting period or the expected lives of customer relationships, which generally range from two to three years. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals and our newer product offerings. &#160; 

&#160; 

Customer Payment Terms 

&#160; 

Payment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Payment terms may vary by customer but generally do not exceed 45 days from invoice date. Invoicing for digital engagement services are either monthly or upon achievement of milestones and payment terms for such billings are within the standard terms described above. Invoicing for subscriptions and hosting are typically issued monthly and are generally due in the month of service. 

&#160; 

The Company's digital engagement services agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise concerns over delivered services, the Company has endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented. The Company&#8217;s subscription and hosting agreements provide for refunds when service is interrupted for an extended period of time and are reserved for in the month in which they occur if necessary.

&#160;

Warranty 

&#160; 

Certain arrangements include a warranty period, which is generally 30 days from the completion of work. In hosting arrangements, the Company provides warranties of up-time reliability. The Company continues to monitor the conditions that are subject to the warranties to identify if a warranty claim may arise. If it is determined that a warranty claim is probable, then any related cost to satisfy the warranty obligation is estimated and accrued. Warranty claims to date have been immaterial. 

&#160; 

Reimbursable Expenses 

&#160; 

In connection with certain arrangements, reimbursable expenses are incurred and billed to customers and such amounts are recognized as both revenue and cost of revenue. 

&#160; 

Equipment and Improvements 

&#160; 

The components of equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets (three to five years). Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 

&#160; 

Internal Use Software 

&#160; 

Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, internal and external costs, if direct and incremental, are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable that the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized costs are recorded as part of equipment and improvements. Training costs are expensed as incurred. Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. 

&#160; 

Research and Development and Software Development Costs 

&#160; 

Costs for research and development of a product to sell, lease or otherwise market are charged to operations as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. Once technological feasibility has been established, certain software development costs incurred during the application development stage are eligible for capitalization. Based on the Company&#8217;s product development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. 

&#160; 

Software development costs that are capitalized are amortized to cost of sales over the estimated useful life of the software, typically three years. Capitalization ceases when a product is available for general release to customers. Capitalization costs are included in other assets in the consolidated financial statements. The Company capitalized $142 and $63 of costs in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.

Intangible Assets 

&#160; 

All intangible assets have finite lives and are stated at cost, net of amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of the related assets on a straight-line method as follows:

Goodwill 

&#160; 

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the business acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of every year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Goodwill is assessed at the consolidated level as one reporting unit. In assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If this is the case, then performing the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. An entity can choose not to perform a qualitative assessment for any or all of its reporting units, and proceed directly to the use of the two-step impairment test. In assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit are assessed. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit&#8217;s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events which are specific to the company, and trends in the market price of our common stock. Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact. 

&#160; 

For fiscal 2016, the Company performed the annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2016 and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. In estimating fair value, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting unit to determine fair value. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was more than its corresponding carrying amount. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company assessed that goodwill was not impaired. 

&#160; 

For fiscal 2015, the Company performed the annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2015. In estimating fair value, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting unit to determine fair value. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its corresponding carrying amount. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $10.5 million in 2015. 

&#160; 

While there are inherent limitations in any valuation, the Company believes that using a Discounted Cash Flow Method is the most indicative of the fair value, or the price, that the Company would be sold at in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company believes the most significant change in circumstances that could affect the key assumptions in our valuation are a significant reduction in the observed revenue multiples implied by future mergers and acquisitions and/or a significant deterioration of the Company&#8217;s projected financial performance. 

&#160; 

The Company records contingent consideration payments as additional purchase price and goodwill at the acquisition date. Any adjustments made within one year from the acquisition date are charged to goodwill. Any adjustment made after the one year refinement period will be charged to the consolidated statement of operations.

The Company periodically reviews its long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may exceed their fair value. Recoverability of these assets is assessed using a number of factors including operating results, business plans, budgets, economic projections and undiscounted cash flows. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Company&#8217;s evaluation considers non-financial data such as market trends, product development cycles and changes in management&#8217;s market emphasis. For the definite-lived intangible asset impairment review, the carrying value of the intangible assets is compared against the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated over the remaining life of the intangible assets. To the extent that the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value, the fair value of the asset is determined and impairment is recognized. If such fair value is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value. There were no impairments in fiscal 2016 or 2015. 

&#160; 

Deferred Revenue 

&#160; 

Deferred revenue includes PCS and services billed in advance. PCS revenue, whether sold separately or as part of a multiple element arrangement, is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract, generally 12 months. Payments made for PCS fees are generally made in advance and are nonrefundable. Revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the related services are performed, using a proportional performance model. 

&#160; 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. Estimated fair values of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies, as applicable. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company believes the recorded values for accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate current fair values as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 because of their nature and durations. The carrying value of debt instruments also approximates fair value as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 based on acceptable valuation methodologies which use market data of similar size and situated debt issues. 

&#160; 

Fa ir Value Measurement s 

&#160; 

For fair value measurements, the Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The use of market-based information over entity specific information is also prioritized and establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. 

&#160; 

The hierarchy established under the Codification gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). 

&#160; 

Level 1 &#8211;Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

&#160; 

Level 2 &#8211; Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and 

&#160; 

Level 3 &#8211; Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Foreign Currency 

&#160; 

The Company determines the appropriate method of measuring assets and liabilities as to whether the method should be based on the functional currency of the entity in the environment it operates or the reporting currency of the Company, the U.S. dollar. The Company has determined that the functional currency of its Indian subsidiary is the Rupee. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense items are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period. The adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity and are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company&#8217;s foreign currency translation net gains (losses) for fiscal 2016 and 2015 were $3 and $(23), respectively. Translation gains and losses related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency different from a subsidiary&#8217;s functional currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations. 

&#160; 

Segment Information 

&#160; 

The Company has sales offices in the United States that operate internally as one reportable operating segment because all of these locations have similar economic characteristics. 

&#160; 

Stock-Based Compensation 

&#160; 

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values of the awards on the date of grant on a straight-line basis over their vesting term. Compensation expense is recognized only for share-based payments expected to vest. The Company estimates forfeitures at the date of grant based on the Company&#8217;s historical experience and future expectations. 

&#160; 

Valuation of Stock Options and Warrants Issued to Non-Employees 

&#160; 

The Company measures expense for non-employee stock-based compensation and the estimated fair value of options exchanged in business combinations and warrants issued for services using the fair value method for services received or the equity instruments issued, whichever is more readily measured. The Company estimated the fair value of stock options issued to non-employees using the Black-Scholes Merton option valuation model. 

&#160; 

The Company estimated the fair value of common stock warrants issued to non-employees using the binomial options pricing model. The Company evaluates common stock warrants as they are issued to determine whether they should be classified as an equity instrument or a liability. Those warrants that are classified as a liability are carried at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in their fair value recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operation. 

&#160; 

Advertising Costs 

&#160; 

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred. Such costs were $621 and $461 for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

Employee Benefits 

&#160; 

The Company sponsors a contributory 401(k) plan allowing all full-time employees who meet prescribed service requirements to participate. The Company is not required to make matching contributions, although the plan provides for discretionary contributions by the Company. The Company made no contributions in either fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015.

Income Taxes 

&#160; 

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company&#8217;s financial statements and tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

&#160; 

The Company provides for reserves for potential payments of taxes to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. Reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; to be realized following resolution of any uncertainty related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are included in the provision for income taxes. 

&#160; 

The Company does not provide for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its Indian subsidiary, which the Company considers to be permanent investments. 

&#160; 

Net Los s Per Share 

&#160; 

Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and warrants using the &#8220;treasury stock&#8221; method. The computation of diluted earnings per share does not include the effect of outstanding stock options and warrants that are anti-dilutive. 

&#160; 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

&#160; 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, it is possible more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than required under existing U.S. GAAP including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year delay in the effective date. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, (the &#8220;Update&#8221;), which eliminates the current requirement to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, entities will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The Update is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Management does not expect the adoption of this Update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

&#160; 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, which is guidance on accounting for leases. ASU No, 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases and will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach. The Company is evaluating the impact of the guidance on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and related disclosures. 

&#160; &#160;

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, which amended guidance related to employee share-based payment accounting. The new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments in this standard are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of this Standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

&#160; 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, which adds further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understanding of the licensing implementation guidance. 

&#160; 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which addresses narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, noncash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. Management is evaluating the new guidelines to determine if they will have a significant impact on consolidated results of operation, financial condition or cash flows. 

&#160; 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows, specifically certain cash receipts and cash payments. The standard is effective for public business entities financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective method. Management does not expect the adoption of this Standard to have a material impact on our consolidated cash flows.

&#160; &#160; 

The Company has determined that the most appropriate approach to use to determine the fair value of the reporting unit is the discounted cash flow method. Using the discounted cash flow method, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2015, the Company concluded that goodwill was impaired and recorded a $10.5 million goodwill impairment loss. In fiscal 2015, the fair value of our reporting unit was impacted by lower than forecasted revenues, volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock, longer sales cycles, and higher operating losses. A comparison to the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value resulted in the impairment charge. 

&#160; &#160;

Line of Credit and Bank Term Loan 

&#160; 

In June 2016, the Company replaced its Loan and Security Agreement with BridgeBank (the &#8220;Bridgebank Agreement&#8221;) with a new Loan and Security Agreement with Heritage Bank of Commerce (&#8220;Heritage Agreement&#8221; or &#8220;Loan Agreement&#8221;). The Heritage Agreement has a term of 24 months and will expire on June 9, 2018. The Company will pay an annual commitment fee of 0.4% of the commitment amount in the first year and 0.2% in the second year. Borrowings are secured by all of the Company&#8217;s assets and all of the Company&#8217;s intellectual property. The Company will be required to comply with certain financial and reporting covenants including an Asset Coverage Ratio and an Adjusted EBITDA metric. The Heritage Agreement provides for up to $3 million of revolving credit advances which may be used for acquisitions and working capital purposes.

&#160; 

To secure all of Guarantor's obligations hereunder, Guarantor assigns and grants to Lender a security interest in all moneys, securities, and other property of Guarantor now or hereafter in the possession of Lender, all deposit accounts of Guarantor maintained with Lender, and all proceeds thereof. Upon default or breach of any of Guarantor's obligations to Lender, Lender may apply any deposit account to reduce the Indebtedness, and may foreclose any collateral as provided in the Uniform Commercial Code and in any security agreements between Lender and Guarantor. 

&#160; 

The Bridgebank Agreement had an original term of 27 months and was extended to a maturity date of March 31, 2017. The Bridgebank Agreement provided for up to $5 million of revolving credit advances which could be used for acquisitions and working capital purposes. Borrowings were limited to the lesser of (i) $5 million and (ii) 80% of eligible receivables as defined. The Company could borrow up to $1.0 million in out of formula borrowings for specified periods of time. Borrowings accrued interest at BridgeBank&#8217;s prime plus 1.00% (4.25%) through June 1, 2015 and then increased to prime plus 5.00% (8.25%) in accordance with an amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement (see below). The prime rate increased to 3.50% on December 17, 2015. The Company paid an annual commitment fee of 0.25%. Borrowings were secured by all of the Company&#8217;s assets and all of the Company&#8217;s intellectual property.

10.&#160;Restructuring Charges 

&#160; 

During the second half of fiscal 2015 and through fiscal 2016, the Company&#8217;s management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies by implementing cost reductions in line with the recent decrease in revenue. The Company renegotiated several office leases and relocated to smaller space, while also negotiating sub-leases for the original space. In addition, the Company executed a general work-force reduction and recognized costs for severance and termination benefits. These restructuring charges and accruals require estimates and assumptions, including contractual rental commitments or lease buy-outs for vacated office space and related costs, and estimated sub-lease income. The Company&#8217;s sub-lease assumptions include the rates to be charged to a sub-tenant and the timing of the sub-lease arrangement. All of the vacated lease space is currently contractually occupied by a new sub-tenant for the remaining life of the lease. These estimates and assumptions will be monitored on a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances with the corresponding adjustments reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. 

&#160; 

In total, a charge of $879 and $496 was recorded to restructuring expenses for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 in the consolidated statement of operations for the total lease expenses less sub-lease rental income, other miscellaneous lease termination costs, loss on disposal of fixed assets, and costs for severance and termination benefits.

Other Commitments, Guarantees, and Indemnification Obligations 

&#160; 

The Company frequently warrants that the technology solutions it develops for its clients will operate in accordance with the project specifications without defects for a specified warranty period, subject to certain limitations that the Company believes are standard in the industry. In the event that defects are discovered during the warranty period, and none of the limitations apply, the Company is obligated to remedy the defects until the solution that the Company provided operates within the project specifications. The Company is not typically obligated by contract to provide its clients with any refunds of the fees they have paid, although a small number of its contracts provide for the payment of liquidated damages upon default. The Company has purchased insurance policies covering professional errors and omissions, property damage and general liability that reduce its monetary exposure for warranty-related claims and enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s contracts typically provide for testing and client acceptance procedures that are designed to mitigate the likelihood of warranty-related claims, although there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective for each project. The Company has not paid any material amounts related to warranties for its solutions. The Company sometimes commits unanticipated levels of effort to projects to remedy defects covered by its warranties. The Company&#8217;s estimate of its exposure to warranties on contracts is immaterial as of September 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s agreements with customers generally require the Company to indemnify the customer against claims in which the Company&#8217;s products infringe third-party patents, copyrights, or trademarks and indemnify against product liability matters. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, the Company has not experienced any losses related to the indemnification obligations and no significant claims with respect thereto were outstanding. The Company does not expect significant claims related to the indemnification obligations and, consequently, concluded that the fair value of these obligations is negligible, and no related reserves were established. 

&#160; 

Litigation 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to ordinary routine litigation and claims incidental to its business. As of September 30, 2016, Bridgeline was not engaged with any material legal proceedings.

Net proceeds to the Company after offering expenses were approximately $1.8 million. The shares of Preferred Stock may be converted, at the option of the holder at any time, into such number of shares of common stock (&#8220;Conversion Shares&#8221;) equal (i) to the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, multiplied by the stated value of $10.00 (the &#8220;Stated Value&#8221;) and (ii) divided by the conversion price in effect at the time of conversion. The initial conversion price is $3.25, and is subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits or stock dividends. Any accrued but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted shall also be converted in common stock at the conversion price. A mandatory provision also may provide that the Company will have the right to require the holders to convert shares of Preferred Stock into Conversion Shares if (i) the Company&#8217;s common stock has closed at or above $6.50 per share for ten consecutive trading days and (ii) the Conversion Shares are (A) registered for resale on an effective registration statement or (B) may be resold pursuant to Rule 144. 

&#160; 

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of common stock, the amount equal to the stated value per share of Series A Preferred Stock plus declared and unpaid dividends, if any. After such payment has been made, the remaining assets of the Company will be distributed ratably to the holders of common stock. 

&#160; 

Cumulative dividends are payable at a rate of 6% per year. If the Company does not pay the dividends in cash, then the Company may pay dividends in any quarter by delivery of additional shares of Preferred Stock (&#8220;PIK Election&#8221;). If the Company shall make the PIK Election with respect to the dividend payable, it shall deliver a number of shares of Preferred Stock equal to (A) the aggregate dividend payable to such holder as of the end of the quarter divided by (B) the lesser of (x) the then effective Conversion Price or (y) the average VWAP for the five (5) consecutive Trading Days prior to such dividend payment date. If, after two years, any Preferred Stock are outstanding the cash dividend rate will increase to 12.0% per year. The Company shall have the right to force conversion of the Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock at any time after the Common Stock trades in excess of $6.50 per share. The Preferred Shares shall vote with the Common on an as converted basis.

Compensation Expense 

&#160; 

The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model (the &#8220;Model&#8221;). The assumptions used to calculate compensation expense is as follows:

&#160; &#160; $0.60 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; $1.30 &#160; &#160; &#160;

Compensation expense is generally recognized on a graded accelerated basis over the vesting period of grants. During the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $214 and $216, respectively, as compensation expense related to share based payments. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $836 of unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested options which the Company expects to recognize through fiscal 2019. 

&#160; 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 

&#160; 

On April 12, 2012, the Company&#8217;s stockholders approved and adopted the Bridgeline Digital, Inc. 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#8220;ESPP&#8221;). Under the terms of the ESPP, the Company granted eligible employees the right to purchase shares of Bridgeline common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of Bridgeline common stock on the purchase termination date of defined offering or purchase periods. Each offering period was six months in duration. The ESPP permits the Company to offer up to 60,000 shares of common stock. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be purchased by all participants in any purchase period may not exceed 30,000 shares. As of September 30, 2015, 19,977 shares were issued under the ESPP plan. The ESPP Plan was cancelled in fiscal 2016 and no shares were issued under this plan in fiscal 2016.

The Company&#8217;s income tax provision was computed using the federal statutory rate and average state statutory rates, net of related federal benefit. The provision differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pretax income, as follows:

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforward of approximately $26 million that expires on various dates through 2036. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable income which can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control of a loss corporation. Due to these &#8220;change of ownership&#8221; provisions, utilization of NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis. However, if performed, Section 382 may be found to limit potential future utilization of the Company&#8217;s NOL carryforwards. The Company also has approximately $22 million in state NOLs which expire on various dates through 2036. 

&#160; 

The Company has deferred tax assets that are available to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management believes that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has established a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016 and 2015. For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased $1,964 and $2,917, respectively, which was mainly due to the increases in the net operating losses. 

&#160; 

The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recognized as a component of tax expense. 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of certain state jurisdictions. The Company has not been audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or any states in connection with income taxes. The tax periods from 2013 to 2016 generally remain open to examination by the IRS and state authorities.

Undistributed losses of the Company&#8217;s foreign subsidiary amounted to approximately $(415) and $(184) at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested; accordingly, no provision for US federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both US income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the applicable foreign tax authority. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred US income tax liability is not material and the detailed calculations have not been performed. As of September 30, 2016, there would be minimal withholding taxes upon remittance of all previously unremitted earnings. 

&#160; 

When accounting for uncertain income tax positions, the impact of uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements if they are more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company&#8217;s management has determined that the Company has no uncertain tax positions requiring recognition as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; 14. Net Loss per Share 

&#160; 

For fiscal 2016 and 2015, all outstanding options to purchase shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock totaling 2,424,919 and 875,977, respectively, were considered as anti-dilutive, as the options were all valued at more than the current market price. Common stock warrants of 1,643,724 and 703,281 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were also excluded due to their anti-dilutive nature. Also, excluded were contingent shares issuable in connection with the Magnetic, MarketNet and ElementsLocal acquisitions for fiscal 2015 and contingent shares issuable in connection with ElementsLocal acquisition for fiscal 2016.
