Business. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, the term &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Westwood,&#8221; or &#8220;Westwood Holdings Group&#8221; when used in this Form 10-K (&#8220;Report&#8221;) and in the Annual Report to the Stockholders refers to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole. This Report contains some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results and the timing of some events could differ materially from those projected in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including without limitation those set forth under &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;. 

General 

We manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through our subsidiaries, Westwood Management Corp. and Westwood Advisors, LLC (together, &#8220;Westwood Management&#8221;), Westwood International Advisors Inc. (&#8220;Westwood International&#8221;) and Westwood Trust. Westwood Management, founded in 1983, provides investment advisory services to institutional investors, a family of mutual funds called the Westwood Funds&#174;, other mutual funds, an Ireland-domiciled fund organized pursuant to the European Union&#8217;s Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (&#8220;UCITS&#8221;), individual investors and clients of Westwood Trust. Westwood International was established in 2012 and provides investment advisory services to institutional clients, the Westwood Funds&#174;, other mutual funds, UCITS funds and clients of Westwood Trust. Westwood Trust, founded as a state-chartered trust company in 1974, provides trust and custodial services and participation in self-sponsored common trust funds to institutions and high net worth individuals. Our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of assets under management. Westwood Management, Westwood International and Westwood Trust collectively managed assets valued at approximately $20.8 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 . We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 12, 2001. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;WHG.&#8221; We are a holding company whose principal assets consist of the capital stock of Westwood Management, Westwood Trust and Westwood International. 

The success of our business is very dependent on client relationships. We believe that, in addition to investment performance, client service is paramount in the asset management business. Accordingly, a major business focus is to build strong relationships with clients to enhance our ability to anticipate their needs and satisfy their investment objectives. Our team approach is designed to deliver efficient, responsive service to our clients. 

We have focused on building our foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a larger business. We have developed investment strategies that we expect to be desirable within our target institutional, private wealth and mutual fund markets. Developing new investment strategies and building the organization can result in incurring expenses before significant offsetting revenues are realized. We continue to evaluate new strategies and resources in terms of meeting actual and potential investor needs. 

Acquisition of Woodway Financial Advisors 

On January 15, 2015 , we entered into an agreement (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire Woodway Financial Advisors (&#8220;Woodway&#8221;), a Houston-based private wealth and trust company that managed assets of approximately $1.6 billion &#32;at December 31, 2014. We completed the acquisition on &#32; April 1, 2015 . &#32; Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on April 1, 2015 Woodway merged with Westwood Trust, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westwood, with Westwood Trust being the surviving entity (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). The total Merger consideration consisted of (i) $30.6 million &#32;in cash and stock, as described below, and (ii) contingent consideration equal to the annualized revenue from the post-closing business of Woodway for the twelve-month period ending March 31, 2016 (the &#8220;Earn-Out Period&#8221;), adjusted for certain clients or accounts that have terminated, and capped at $15 million &#32;(the &#8220;Earn-Out Amount&#8221;). 

The Merger consideration of $39.7 million &#32;consisted of (i) closing date consideration of $25.3 million &#32;paid in cash and the issuance of 109,712 &#32;shares of Westwood common stock, valued at $5.3 million &#32;(discounted from $6.7 million &#32;due to certain required holding periods), and (ii) contingent consideration of $9.1 million , based on estimates and assumptions as of the closing date of the acquisition, to be paid no later than 75 calendar days after the last day of the Earn-Out Period. The acquired assets were deemed to constitute a business in a transaction using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.

Advisory 

General 

Our advisory business is comprised of Westwood Management and Westwood International and encompasses three distinct investment teams &#8211; the U.S. Value Team, the Global Convertible Securities Team, and the Global and Emerging Markets Equity Team. 

Westwood Management provides investment advisory services to large institutions, including corporate retirement plans, public retirement plans, endowments and foundations. Institutional separate account minimums vary by investment strategy and generally range from $5 million to $25 million. Westwood Management also provides advisory services to individuals, the Westwood Funds&#174; and UCITS funds, as well as subadvisory services to other mutual funds and pooled investment vehicles. Westwood Management&#8217;s investment strategies are managed by the U.S. Value Team, based in Dallas, Texas, and by the Global Convertible Securities Team, based in Boston, Massachusetts. Our investment professionals average fifteen years of investment experience. We believe team continuity and years of experience are among the critical elements required for successfully managing investments. 

Westwood International, based in Toronto, Canada, provides investment advisory services to large institutions, pooled investment vehicles and UCITS funds, as well as subadvisory services to the National Bank Westwood Funds, which are mutual funds offered by National Bank of Canada. Institutional separate account minimums vary by investment strategy and generally range from $10 million to $25 million. Westwood International's investment strategies are managed by the Global and Emerging Markets Equity Team. Westwood International has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with Westwood Management pursuant to which Westwood International is considered a &#8220;participating affiliate&#8221; of Westwood Management as that term is used in relief granted by the staff of the SEC allowing U.S. registered investment advisers to use portfolio management or research resources of advisory affiliates subject to the supervision of a registered adviser. Pursuant to the MOU, Westwood International professionals provide advisory and subadvisory services to certain Westwood Funds&#174;, pooled investment vehicles and large U.S. institutions under the supervision of Westwood Management. 

Investment Strategies 

We offer a broad range of investment strategies, which allows us to serve a variety of client types with different investment objectives. We currently manage five investment strategies each with over $1 billion in assets under management, including our Income Opportunity, LargeCap Value, SMidCap Value, Emerging Markets and Emerging Markets Plus strategies. 

U.S. Value Team 

The U.S. Value team employs a value-oriented approach. The common thread that permeates the team's strategies is a disciplined approach to controlling risk and preserving client assets whenever possible. The team seeks to invest in companies with high levels of free cash flow, improving returns on equity and strengthening balance sheets that are well positioned for growth but whose value is not fully recognized in the marketplace. Through investments in companies that exhibit these characteristics, we seek to generate consistently superior performance relative to our industry peers and relevant benchmark indices. This investment approach is intended to preserve capital during unfavorable periods and provide superior real returns over the long term. We believe that we have established a track record of delivering competitive risk-adjusted returns for our clients. The principal investment strategies currently managed by the U.S. Value Team are as follows: 

LargeCap Value : Investments in equity securities of approximately 40-60 seasoned companies with market capitalizations at purchase generally over $7.5 billion. This portfolio is invested in companies where we expect that future profitability, driven by operational improvements, will exceed expectations reflected in current share prices. 

Concentrated LargeCap Value: Investment in equity securities of approximately 15-30 companies with market capitalizations at purchase generally over $5 billion. This portfolio is invested in companies where we expect that future profitability, driven by operational improvements, will exceed expectations reflected in current share prices. 

SMidCap Plus+: Investments in equity securities of approximately 45-65 companies with market capitalizations at purchase between $2 billion and $15 billion. Similar to our other value-oriented investment strategies, we seek to discover operational improvements driving earnings growth within small to mid-sized companies that can be purchased at reasonable prices. 

SMidCap Value : Investments in equity securities of approximately 50-70 companies with market capitalizations at purchase between $500 million and $8 billion. Similar to our other value-oriented investment strategies, we seek to discover operational improvements driving earnings growth within small to mid-size companies that can be purchased at reasonable prices. This strategy reached its asset capacity in 2010 and is now closed to new investors. 

SmallCap Value : Investments in equity securities of approximately 50-70 companies with market capitalizations at purchase between $100 million and $2 billion. Similar to our other value-oriented investment strategies, we seek to invest in high quality companies whose earnings growth is driven by operational improvements not yet fully recognized by the market. 

AllCap Value : Investments in equity securities of approximately 50-80 seasoned companies. The portfolio generally comprises our investment professionals&#8217; best ideas for companies with market capitalizations at purchase above $100 million. Similar to our other value-oriented investment strategies, we seek to invest in companies across a broad range of market capitalizations where we expect that future profitability, driven by operational improvements, will be higher than expectations currently reflected in share prices. 

Concentrated AllCap Value: Investments in equity securities of approximately 15-30 companies with market capitalization at purchase generally over $100 million. We seek to invest in companies where we expect that future profitability, driven by operational improvements, will be higher than expectations currently reflected in share prices. 

Income Opportunity : Investments in dividend-paying common stocks, preferred stocks, convertible securities, master limited partnerships, royalty trusts, REITs and selected debt instruments. This portfolio&#8217;s strategy focuses on companies with strong and improving cash flows able to support sustainable or rising income streams. This strategy is targeted towards investors seeking current income, a competitive total return and low volatility via dividend-paying or interest-bearing securities. 

Worldwide Income Opportunity: Investments in a diversified group of global income-producing companies that may include market capitalizations of any size, global preferred equity, global convertible preferred, global fixed income, global REITs, Royalty Trusts, MLPs and cash. This portfolio's strategy focuses on companies with strong and improving cash flow sufficient to support sustainable or rising income streams. 

Master Limited Partnership Infrastructure Renewal (&#8220;MLPs&#8221;) : Investments include MLPs (including limited partnerships and general partnerships) and other securities, focusing on partnerships that exhibit higher distribution yields, stable and predictable cash flows, low correlations to other asset classes, and growth potential. 

Global Convertible Securities Team 

The Global Convertible Securities Team manages both long-only and liquid alternative global convertible securities strategies employing a disciplined investment process and rigorous risk management. The team's investment philosophy is based on the following beliefs: 

&#8226; 

the asymmetric return profile of balanced convertible bonds can provide superior risk-adjusted returns over medium- to long-term time horizons; 

&#8226; 

convertible securities markets are inefficient and opportunities exist to benefit from pricing anomalies; 

&#8226; 

a global focus provides more robust opportunities and a clearer picture of the broad convertibles universe; and 

&#8226; 

proprietary fundamental research is the best way to identify solid companies with attractive risk-adjusted return profiles. 

The team draws on the proprietary fundamental research of all three of Westwood's investment teams in order to identify securities with an attractive risk-adjusted return profile. The principal investment strategies currently managed by the Global Convertible Securities Team are as follows: 

Strategic Global Convertibles : &#32; This strategy seeks to provide equity-like returns with lower volatility by investing in a balanced portfolio of 60-90 worldwide convertible securities. 

Market Neutral Income : &#32; This liquid alternative strategy seeks to produce positive absolute returns over a full market cycle with low volatility by combining a yield-focused portfolio that invests in high quality, short duration convertible securities with a hedged portfolio utilizing convertible arbitrage and other hedging strategies. 

Global and Emerging Markets Equity Team 

The Global and Emerging Markets Equity Team emphasizes Economic Value Added (EVA) in its investment process and seeks to identify mispriced businesses that can generate sustainable earnings growth. The team offers global and emerging markets equity investment strategies. The principal investment strategies currently managed by the Global and Emerging Markets Equity Team are as follows: 

Emerging Markets: This strategy invests in the common stocks of 70-90 companies that are located or have primary operations in emerging markets with market capitalizations above $500 million. The portfolio is invested in companies that we believe represents sound businesses that are mispriced and can generate sustainable earnings growth. 

Emerging Markets Plus: This strategy invests in the common stocks of 50-70 companies that are located or have primary operations in emerging markets and have market capitalizations above $1.5 billion. The portfolio is invested in companies that we believe represent sound businesses that are mispriced and can generate sustainable earnings growth. 

Emerging Markets SMid: This strategy invests in the common stocks of 70-90 small- and mid-cap companies that are located or have primary operations in emerging markets and have market capitalizations between $150 million and $9 billion. The portfolio is invested in companies that we believe are sound businesses that are mispriced and can generate sustainable earnings growth. 

Global Equity: This strategy invests in the common stocks of 65-85 companies located throughout the world, with market capitalizations above $1 billion. Similar to our Emerging Markets strategy, the portfolio invests in companies that we believe are sound businesses that are mispriced and can generate sustainable earnings growth. 

Global Dividend: This strategy invests in the common stocks of 65-90 well-established companies around the world, with an emphasis on sustainability and growth of dividends. It seeks to invest in strong franchises that we believe are mispriced, with good liquidity, the ability to generate sustainable economic profits and potentially pay dividends. 

Our ability to grow assets under management is primarily dependent on our ability to generate competitive investment performance, our success in building strong relationships with investment consulting firms and other financial intermediaries, as well as our ability to develop new client relationships while nurturing existing relationships. We continually seek to expand assets under management by growing our existing investment strategies, as well as identifying and developing new ones. We intend to grow our investment strategies internally but may also consider acquiring new investment strategies from third parties, as discussed under &#8220;Growth Strategy&#8221; below. Our growth strategy provides clients with more investment opportunities and diversifies our assets under management, thereby reducing risk in any one area of investment and increasing our competitive ability to attract new clients. Our ten largest clients accounted for over 20% of our fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. The loss of some or all of these large clients could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. 

Advisory and Subadvisory Agreements 

Westwood Management and Westwood International manage client accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements. Typical for the asset management industry, these agreements are usually terminable upon short notice and provide for compensation based on the market value of client assets under management. Westwood&#8217;s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter, quarterly in arrears based on assets under management on the last day of the previous quarter, or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of assets under management for the stated period. A few clients have contractual performance-based fee arrangements, which generate additional revenues if we outperform a specified index over a specific period of time. Revenue for performance-based fees is recorded at the end of the measurement period. Revenue from advance payments is deferred and recognized over the period that services are performed. Pursuant to these agreements, Westwood provides overall investment management services, including directing investments in conformity with client-established investment objectives and restrictions. Unless otherwise directed in writing by clients, Westwood has the authority to vote all proxies with respect to securities in client portfolios. 

Westwood Management and Westwood International are parties to subadvisory agreements with other investment advisors under which they perform similar services under advisory agreements. Our subadvisory fees are generally computed based upon the average daily assets under management and are payable on a monthly basis.

Trust 

General 

Through the combined efforts of the Dallas, Omaha and Houston offices of Westwood Trust, we provide fiduciary and investment services to high net worth individuals and families, non-profit endowments and foundations, public and private retirement plans and individual retirement accounts ("IRAs"). Westwood Trust is chartered and regulated by the Texas Department of Banking. Fees charged by Westwood Trust are separately negotiated with each client and are typically based on assets under management. Clients generally have at least $1 million in investable assets. 

Fiduciary Services 

Westwood Trust&#8217;s fiduciary services include but are not limited to: financial planning, wealth transfer planning, customizable trust services, trust administration and estate settlement. Westwood Trust also provides custodial services, tax reporting, accounting of trust income and principal, beneficiary and retiree distributions and safekeeping of assets. 

Investment Services 

Westwood Trust utilizes a consultative approach in developing a client&#8217;s portfolio asset allocation. Our approach involves examining the client&#8217;s financial situation, including their current portfolio of investments, and advising the client on ways to reduce risk, enhance investment returns and strengthen their financial position based on each client&#8217;s unique objectives and constraints. Westwood Trust seeks to define and improve risk/return profiles of client investment portfolios by offering a comprehensive investment solution or enhancing clients&#8217; existing investment strategies. Westwood Trust manages separate portfolios of equity and fixed income securities for certain agency and trust clients. Equity portfolios are generally patterned after the institutional strategies offered by Westwood Management or developed by the internal investment team in our Houston Woodway office. Fixed income portfolios consist of targeted laddered portfolios of primarily high quality municipal securities. 

Westwood Trust also sponsors several common trust funds in which client assets are commingled to achieve economies of scale. Westwood Trust&#8217;s common trust funds fall within two basic categories: personal trusts and employee benefit trusts. Westwood Trust sponsors common trust funds for most of the investment strategies managed by Westwood Management and Westwood International. Westwood Trust has also engaged SKY Harbor Capital Management, LLC, William Blair &#38; Company, LLC and Brandywine Global Investment Management, LLC, all registered investment advisors, to subadvise our High Yield Bond, Domestic Growth Equity and International Fixed Income common trust funds, respectively. 

Westwood Trust also develops asset allocation models for certain clients utilizing mutual funds managed by Westwood Management and Westwood International, as well as from certain other mutual fund families. 

Enhanced Balanced&#174; Portfolios 

Westwood Trust is a strong proponent of asset class diversification and offers its clients the ability to diversify among many different asset classes. Westwood Trust Enhanced Balanced&#174; portfolios combine these asset classes into a customizable portfolio for clients seeking to maximize return for a given level of risk. Periodic adjustments are made to asset class weightings in Enhanced Balanced&#174; portfolios based on historical returns, risk and correlation data and our current capital markets outlook. 

Distribution Channels 

We market our services through several distribution channels to optimize the reach of our investment advisory and trust services. These channels enable us to leverage distribution infrastructures and capabilities of other financial services firms and intermediaries while focusing on our core competency of developing and managing investment strategies. 

Institutional 

In our institutional channel, we market our investment strategies through institutional investment consultants, financial intermediaries, managed accounts programs and directly to institutional investors. Institutional investment consultants serve as gatekeepers to the majority of corporate retirement plans, public retirement plans, endowments and foundations, which represent Westwood&#8217;s primary institutional target markets. Consultants provide guidance to their clients in setting asset allocation strategies, as well as creating investment policies. Consultants also make recommendations for investment firms they believe can best meet their client&#8217;s investment objectives. We have established strong relationships with many global, national and regional investment consulting firms, which collectively have contributed to our being considered and hired by their clients. Continuing to enhance existing consulting firm relationships, as well as forging new relationships, increases the awareness of our services in both the consultant community and within their institutional client base. 

Marketing our investment strategies to financial intermediaries, via subadvisory relationships, allows us to extend the reach of our investment advisory services to clients of other investment companies with broad, established distribution capabilities. In subadvisory arrangements, our client is generally the investment company through which our services are offered to investors, typically via mutual fund offerings. The investment company that sponsors the mutual fund is responsible for appropriate marketing, distribution and operational and accounting activities. 

Managed accounts are similar in some respects to subadvisory relationships in that a third-party financial institution, such as a brokerage firm or turnkey asset management program provider, handles distribution to the end client. The end client in a managed account is typically a high net worth individual or small institution. In these arrangements, the third-party financial institution is responsible to the end client for client service, operations and accounting. 

We also market our investment strategies directly to pension funds, endowments, foundations and other institutional investors. 

Mutual Funds 

In our mutual funds channel, we market our registered mutual funds, the Westwood Funds&#174;, to institutional investment consultants, financial intermediaries, registered investment advisors, select broker-dealers and fund supermarkets. By leveraging our existing relationships with institutional investment consulting firms we are able to participate when their defined contribution and other retirement plan clients require a mutual fund vehicle. We also seek relationships with financial intermediaries that manage discretionary fund models in order to have our funds placed in such models. Our wholesaling group markets our funds directly to registered investment advisors, select broker-dealers and mutual fund supermarkets. 

Private Wealth 

In our private wealth channel, we generate awareness of our trust fiduciary and investment services through investment consultants, centers of influence, community involvement and targeted direct marketing to high net worth individuals, families and small to medium-sized institutions. A significant portion of our new asset growth has been generated by referrals from existing clients. 

Growth Strategy 

We believe that we have established a strong platform to support future growth, deriving our strength in large part from the experience and capabilities of our management team and skilled investment professionals. We believe that this focused, stable team has contributed significantly to our solid investment performance, superior client service and a growing array of investment strategies. We believe that opportunities for future growth may come from our ability to: 

&#8226; 

generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships; 

&#8226; 

attract and retain key employees; 

&#8226; 

grow assets in our existing investment strategies; 

&#8226; 

foster continued growth of the Westwood Trust platform; 

&#8226; 

expand distribution via mutual funds; 

&#8226; 

seek strategic corporate development opportunities; 

&#8226; 

pursue opportunities internationally through targeted sales and relationships with international distributors and institutional investors; 

&#8226; 

continue to strengthen our brand name; and 

&#8226; 

develop or acquire new investment strategies. 

Generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships . As our primary business objective, we intend to maintain and enhance existing relationships with clients and investment consultants by providing solid investment performance and attentive client service. We also intend to pursue growth via targeted sales and marketing efforts that emphasize our investment philosophy, performance and superior client service. New institutional client accounts are sourced from either investment consultants or from our direct sales efforts with institutional investors. We believe that the in-depth knowledge of our firm, our people and our processes embedded in our consultant relationships, as well as in existing and prospective client relationships, is a key factor when being considered for new client investment mandates. 

Attract and retain key employees . To achieve our investment performance and client relationship objectives, we must be able to attract and retain talented professionals. We believe that we have created a workplace environment in which motivated, performance-driven, and client-oriented individuals can thrive. As a public company, we offer our employees a compensation program that includes strong equity incentives to closely align their success with that of our clients and stockholders. We believe that these factors are critical to maintaining a stable, client-focused environment that can support significant future growth. 

Grow assets in our existing investment strategies . We have significant capacity for additional assets across our existing range of investment strategies, which we have continued to expand. We have developed a range of approximately 20 institutional investment strategies by building on the core competencies of our U.S. Value team, which has now been in place for over 30 years, as well as via the addition of new investment teams. In 2012, we initiated our Global and Emerging Markets Equity Team, thereby adding five new equity strategies that focus on emerging and global markets: Emerging Markets, Emerging Markets Plus, Emerging Markets SMid, Global Equity and Global Dividend. Our emerging markets strategies have experienced strong investor demand, and we believe they provide additional growth opportunities. In 2014, we established the Westwood Global Convertible Securities Team, which manages two strategies - a long-only strategy, Global Convertibles Securities, and a market neutral strategy, Market Neutral Income. Our U.S. Value Team has launched four new strategies since 2014 - Concentrated LargeCap Value, Concentrated AllCap Value, MLP Opportunities and MLP &#38; Strategic Energy - and in 2015 we launched our second Multi-Asset strategy, Worldwide Income Opportunity, a global version of our very successful Income Opportunity strategy. These recently launched offerings, in combination with our range of seasoned investment strategies, provide significant capacity to grow assets under management. We have the team in place to support these investment strategies and, with continuing strong investment performance, we believe that demand for these strategies can provide meaningful growth for our assets under management. 

Foster continued growth of the Westwood Trust platform. Westwood Trust has experienced solid growth in serving small to medium-sized institutions as well as high net worth individuals and families. We anticipate continued interest from clients and prospects in our diversified, highly attentive service model. A significant percentage of new asset growth at Westwood Trust stems from referrals, as well as gathering additional assets from existing clients. We believe that our Enhanced Balanced &#174; &#32;strategy, which offers diversified exposure to multiple asset classes in a tax-efficient, comprehensive manner, along with our separately managed portfolios, provide good opportunities for growth. 

Foster expanded distribution via mutual funds . We have fifteen funds in the Westwood Funds&#174; family: Westwood SMidCap (WHGMX), Westwood Income Opportunity (WHGIX), Westwood LargeCap Value (WHGLX), Westwood SmallCap Value (WHGSX), Westwood Dividend Growth (WHGDX), Westwood SMidCap Plus+ (WHGPX),Westwood Strategic Global Convertibles (WSGCX), Westwood Market Neutral Income (WMNIX), Westwood Worldwide Income Opportunity (WWIOX), Westwood MLP &#38; Strategic Energy (WMLPX), Westwood Emerging Markets (WWEMX), Westwood Global Equity (WWGEX), Westwood Global Dividend (WWGDX), Westwood Short Duration High Yield (WHGHX) and Westwood Opportunistic High Yield (WWHYX). We believe that providing investors access to our mutual funds is a key component to achieving asset growth in the defined contribution and retirement marketplaces as well as with registered investment advisors. With the exception of Westwood Short Duration High Yield and Westwood Opportunistic High Yield, both of which are subadvised by SKY Harbor Capital Management, LLC, the Westwood Funds&#174; generally mirror our institutional strategies. All funds offer capped expense ratios and are available in an institutional share class. We also offer Class A shares for Westwood LargeCap Value (WWLAX), Westwood Income Opportunity (WWIAX), Westwood Emerging Markets (WWEAX) and Westwood Short Duration High Yield (WSDAX) in order to target No Transaction Fee (NTF) mutual fund supermarket platforms and the broker/dealer marketplace. Westwood Market Neutral Income (WMNUX) and Westwood Opportunistic High Yield (WHYUX) offer an Ultra share class generally only available to institutional investors who purchase the fund directly and for which no shareholder servicing fees are paid. 

Pursue strategic corporate development opportunities. We evaluate strategic corporate development opportunities to augment organic growth. We may pursue various transactions, including acquisitions of asset management firms, mutual funds or private wealth firms, as well as hiring investment professionals or teams. We consider opportunities to enhance our existing operations, expand our range of investment strategies and services or further develop our distribution capabilities. By acquiring investment firms or by hiring investment professionals or teams that successfully manage investment strategies beyond our current expertise, we can both attract new clients and provide existing clients with an even more diversified range of investment strategies. We may also consider forging alliances with other financial services firms to leverage our core competency of developing superior investment strategies with alliance partners that can provide enhanced distribution capabilities or additional service offerings. In October 2014, we hired our Global Convertible Securities Team to manage a new, convertible securities strategy, and in April 2015, we acquired Woodway to grow our private-wealth business. 

Pursue opportunities internationally through targeted sales and relationships with international distributors and institutional investors. In recent years we have increased our sales efforts outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2015, non-U.S. clients represented 18% of our assets under management compared with 5% as of December 31, 2011. The growth in our non-U.S. client base has primarily been a function of the broadening of our range of investment strategies to include Emerging Markets equity and Global Convertible Securities. In addition, we established a UCITS platform in 2012 and now offer three sub-funds under the UCITS umbrella for non-U.S. investors. We intend to continue our sales efforts outside of the U.S. We may consider forging alliances with international financial services firms or partners to obtain enhanced distribution capabilities and greater access to global customers. We may also target institutional investors in specific non-U.S. markets including Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Switzerland, Scandinavia and the Netherlands. 

Continue to strengthen our brand name. We believe that the strength of our brand name has been a key component to our long-term success in the investment industry and will be instrumental to our future success. We have developed our strong brand name largely through excellent performance coupled with high profile coverage in investment publications and electronic media. Several of our investment professionals have been visible in print and electronic media, and we will continue to look for creative ways to strengthen our brand name and reputation in our target markets. 

Develop or acquire new investment strategies. We continue to look for opportunities to expand the range of investment strategies that we offer to existing and prospective clients. We may consider internally-developed strategies that extend our existing investment process to new markets and may also consider externally acquired investment strategies. An expanded range of investment strategies offers additional ways to serve our client base, generating more diversified revenue streams, as well as asset and revenue growth opportunities. 

Competition 

We are subject to substantial and growing competition in all aspects of our business. Barriers to entry in the asset management business are relatively low, and we expect to face a growing number of competitors. Although no one company dominates the asset management industry, many companies are larger, better known and have greater resources than us. 

Further, we compete with other asset management firms on the basis of investment strategies offered, their investment performance both in absolute terms and relative to peer groups, quality of service, fees charged, the level and type of compensation offered to key employees, and the manner in which investment strategies are marketed. Many of our competitors offer more investment strategies and services and have substantially greater assets under management. 

We compete against numerous investment dealers, banks, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, exchange-traded funds, brokerage and investment firms, and others that sell equity funds, taxable income funds, tax-free investments and other investment products. In addition, the allocation of assets by many investors from active equity investment to index funds, fixed income or similar asset classes has enhanced the ability of firms offering non-equity asset classes and passive equity management to compete effectively with us. In summary, our competitive landscape is intense and dynamic, and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future as an independent company. 

Additionally, most prospective clients perform a thorough review of an investment manager&#8217;s background, investment policies and performance before committing assets to that manager. In many cases, prospective clients invite a number of competing firms to make presentations. The process of obtaining a new client typically takes twelve to eighteen months from the time of the initial contact. While we have achieved success in competing for new clients, it is a process to which we dedicate significant resources over an extended period, with no certainty of winning. 

Regulation 

Westwood Management 

Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients. Under such laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit advisers from carrying on their business if they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions include suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material laws and regulations. 

Our business is subject to regulation at federal and state levels by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Westwood Management Corp. and Westwood Advisors, LLC are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Investment Advisers Act&#8221;) and under the laws of various states. As registered investment advisers, Westwood Management Corp. and Westwood Advisors, LLC are regulated and subject to examination by the SEC. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, record keeping operational and marketing requirements and disclosure obligations. Westwood Management Corp. also acts as adviser to the Westwood Funds&#174;, a family of mutual funds registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act"). As an adviser to a registered investment company, Westwood Management Corp. must comply with the Investment Company Act and related regulations. The Investment Company Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment companies, including requirements relating to operations, fees charged, sales, accounting, record keeping, disclosure, governance and restrictions on transactions with affiliates. Under SEC rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to the federal securities laws, we are subject to periodic SEC examinations. The SEC can institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from censure to termination of an investment adviser&#8217;s registration. The failure of Westwood Management Corp. and Westwood Advisors, LLC to comply with SEC requirements could have a material adverse effect on Westwood. We must also comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as subsequently amended and reauthorized. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the regulations under the Investment Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act and the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. 

As an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary duty to our clients. The SEC has interpreted that duty to impose standards, requirements and limitations on, among other things: trading of client accounts, allocations of investment opportunities among clients, use of soft dollars, execution of transactions and recommendations to clients. We manage accounts for our clients with the authority to buy and sell securities, select broker-dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. We receive soft dollar credits from certain broker-dealers that reduce certain operating expenses and cash payments to these broker-dealers. Our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act. If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase. 

Westwood Trust 

Westwood Trust operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive supervision and examination. As a Texas chartered trust company, Westwood Trust is subject to the Texas Finance Code (the &#8220;Finance Code&#8221;), the rules and regulations promulgated under the Finance Code and supervision by the Texas Department of Banking. These laws are intended primarily for the protection of Westwood Trust&#8217;s clients and creditors rather than for the benefit of investors. The Finance Code provides for and regulates a variety of matters, such as: 

&#8226; 

minimum capital maintenance requirements; 

&#8226; 

restrictions on dividends; 

&#8226; 

restrictions on investments of restricted capital; 

&#8226; 

lending and borrowing limitations; 

&#8226; 

prohibitions against engaging in certain activities; 

&#8226; 

periodic fiduciary and information technology examinations by the Texas Department of Banking Commissioner; 

&#8226; 

furnishing periodic financial statements to the Texas Department of Banking Commissioner; 

&#8226; 

fiduciary record keeping requirements; and 

&#8226; 

prior regulatory approval for certain corporate events (such as mergers, the sale or purchase of all or substantially all trust company assets and transactions transferring control of a trust company). 

The Finance Code also gives the Banking Commissioner broad regulatory powers (including penalties and civil and administrative actions) if the trust company violates certain provisions of the Finance Code, including implementing conservatorship or closure if Westwood Trust is determined to be in a &#8220;hazardous condition&#8221; (as defined by applicable law). Westwood Trust&#8217;s failure to comply with the Finance Code could have a material adverse effect on Westwood. 

Westwood Trust is limited by the Finance Code in the payment of dividends to undivided profits, which is described as that part of equity capital equal to the balance of net profits, income, gains, and losses since formation minus subsequent distributions to stockholders and transfers to surplus or capital under share dividends or appropriate board resolutions. At the discretion of its Board of Directors, Westwood Trust has made quarterly and special dividend payments to Westwood Holdings Group, Inc. out of undivided profits. 

Westwood International 

Westwood International is registered with both the Ontario Securities Commission (&#8220;OSC&#8221;) and the Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s financiers (&#8220;AMF&#8221;) in Qu&#233;bec. 

The OSC is an independent Crown corporation responsible for regulating the capital markets in Ontario. Its statutory mandate is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices and to foster fair and efficient capital markets and confidence in capital markets. The OSC has rule making and enforcement powers to help safeguard investors, deter misconduct and regulate participants involved in capital markets in Ontario. It regulates firms and individuals that sell securities and provide advice in Ontario, and also regulates public companies, investment funds and marketplaces, such as the Toronto Stock Exchange. The OSC&#8217;s powers are granted under the Securities Act (Ontario) the Commodity Futures Act (Ontario) and certain provisions of the Business Corporations Act. It operates independently from the government and is funded by fees charged to market participants. The OSC is accountable to the Ontario Legislature through the Minister of Finance. 

The AMF is the entity mandated by the government of Qu&#233;bec to regulate the province&#8217;s financial markets and provide assistance to consumers of financial products and services. Established on February 1, 2004 under an Act regarding the Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s financiers , the AMF integrates the regulation of the Qu&#233;bec financial sector, notably in the areas of insurance, securities, deposit institutions (other than banks) and the distribution of financial products and services. Specifically, the AMF&#8217;s mission is to: 

&#8226; 

provide assistance to consumers of financial products and services; 

&#8226; 

ensure that financial institutions and other regulated financial sector entities comply with applicable solvency and obligations imposed by law; 

&#8226; 

supervise activities connected with distribution of financial products and services; 

&#8226; 

supervise stock market and clearing house activities and monitor the securities market; 

&#8226; 

supervise derivatives markets, including derivatives exchanges and clearing houses and ensure that regulated entities and other derivatives market practitioners comply with obligations imposed by law; and 

&#8226; 

implement protection and compensation programs for consumers of financial products and services, and administer compensation funds set up by law. 

Westwood International has entered into a MOU with Westwood Management pursuant to which Westwood International is considered a &#8220;participating affiliate&#8221; of Westwood Management. Subject to certain conditions, the SEC staff allows U.S. registered investment advisers to use portfolio management or research resources of advisory participating affiliates subject to the supervision of a registered adviser. Pursuant to the MOU, Westwood International professionals can provide advisory and subadvisory services to U.S clients subject to SEC rules and regulations and under the supervision of Westwood Management. 

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 

We are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), and to its related regulations insofar as we are a &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; under ERISA with respect to some clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on fiduciaries under ERISA or on entities that provide services to ERISA plan clients and prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had 168 full-time employees (153 based in the United States and 15 based in Canada). No employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations to be good.
