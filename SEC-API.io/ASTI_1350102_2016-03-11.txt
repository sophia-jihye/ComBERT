 Item 1. Business 

Business Overview 

Ascent Solar was formed in October 2005 as a development stage company to commercialize flexible photovoltaic (&#8220;PV&#8221;) modules using our proprietary thin film technology. The technology was initially developed at ITN Energy Systems, Inc. (&#8220;ITN&#8221;) beginning in 1994 and subsequently assigned and licensed to us. Our proprietary manufacturing process deposits multiple layers of materials, including a thin film of highly efficient copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (&#8220;CIGS&#8221;) semiconductor material, on a flexible, lightweight, high tech plastic substrate using a roll-to-roll manufacturing process and then laser patterns the layers to create interconnected PV cells, or PV modules, in a process known as monolithic integration. We believe that our technology and manufacturing process, which results in a much lighter, flexible module package, provides us with unique market opportunities relative to both the crystalline silicon (&#8220;c-Si&#8221;) based PV manufacturers that currently lead the PV market, as well as other thin film PV manufacturers that use substrate materials such as glass, stainless steel or other metals that can be heavier and more rigid than plastics. 

We believe that the use of CIGS on a flexible, durable, lightweight, high tech plastic substrate will allow for unique and seamless integration of our PV modules into a variety of electronic products, defense, transportation and aerospace applications, as well as other products and applications that may emerge. For markets that place a high premium on weight, such as consumer electronics, defense, space, near space, and aeronautic markets, we believe our materials provide attractive increases in power-to-weight ratio, and that our materials have higher power-to-area ratios and voltage-to-area ratios than competing flexible PV thin film technologies. These metrics will be critical as we position ourselves to compete in challenging high value markets such as satellites and near earth orbiting vehicles. Currently, we are producing consumer oriented products with a focus on charging devices powered by or enhanced by our solar modules under the EnerPlex consumer brand. Products in these markets are priced based on the overall product value proposition rather than a commodity-style price-per-watt basis. We continue to develop new consumer products and we have adjusted our utilization of our equipment to meet our near term forecast sales. 

Product History 

In March 2008, we demonstrated initial operating capacity of our first production line by beginning production trials as an end to end integrated process. Initial operating capacity production trials resulted in average thin film device efficiencies of 9.5% and small area monolithically integrated module efficiencies of over 7.0%. During 2008, optimization trials resulted in thin film device efficiencies in the 9.5% to 11.5% range and corresponding module efficiencies in the 7.0% to 9.0% range. The test modules measured approximately 15 centimeters wide by 30 centimeters long. During the first quarter of 2009, we began limited production of monolithically integrated flexible CIGS modules in our initial production line. Our primary business model, at that time, was based upon mass production of solar modules of varying lengths, sizes and configurations. We provided sample modules to potential customers and development partners in various industries to explore integration of our products into new applications. 

In July 2009, we obtained independent verification by the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (&#8220;NREL&#8221;) that our modules measured 10.4% in conversion efficiency. The modules tested at NREL were approximately 15 centimeters wide by 30 centimeters long. In October 2009, NREL further verified our achievement of a manufacturing milestone of 14.0% cell efficiency as well as a peak efficiency of 11.4% for CIGS modules. Later, in December 2010, we achieved 12.1% module efficiency on the same form factor. In October 2010, we completed internal qualification testing of a flexible packaging solution which successfully passed the rigorous standard of one thousand (1,000) hours of damp heat testing (85% relative humidity and 85&#176; C temperature) guideline set forth by International Electrotechnical Commission (&#8220;IEC&#8221;) 61646 standards for performance and long term reliability of thin film solar modules. 

In February 2010, three of our product configurations were certified by an independent laboratory on a variety of U.S. Department of Defense (&#8220;DOD&#8221;) rugged standards known as MIL-STD-810G. In October 2010, we completed full external certification under IEC 61646 at an independent laboratory of a two meter module. Achieving this certification is required for building integrated photovoltaic ("BIPV") and building applied photovoltaic ("BAPV") applications used in commercial, industrial and residential rooftop markets. Certification activities will continue as required as we introduce new products and make changes or improvements to our already certified products. 

In 2010, we received an award from R&#38;D Magazine and were included in their list of the 100 Most Innovative Technologies based on our process of monolithic integration on polyimide substrate. In 2011, Time Magazine selected us as one of the 50 Best Inventions of the year. In 2015 Ascent Solar won its second R&#38;D 100 Award. The 2015 award was given for the development of the MilPak platform, a military-grade (MIL-STD-810G tested) and fully integrated solar power generation and storage unit incorporated with a Maximum Peak Power Tracking (MPPT) management system. The MilPak platform is one of the most rugged, yet lightweight, power generation and storage solutions available, both attributes enabled by the use of Ascent&#8217;s CIGS technology. 

In 2012, we evolved our business model to include B2C, solution based, PV integrated consumer electronics to our off grid high value solar power generation strategy. In June of 2012, we launched our new line of consumer products under the EnerPlex&#8482; brand, and introduced our first product, the Surfr&#8482;, a battery and solar case for the Apple&#174; iPhone&#174; 4/4S smart phone, featuring our ultra-light CIGS thin film technology integrated directly into the case. The case incorporates our ultra-light and thin PV module into a sleek, protective iPhone 4/4S case, along with a thin, life extending, lithium-polymer battery. The case adds minimal weight and size to an iPhone smartphone, yet provides supplemental charging when needed. In August of 2012, we announced the launch of the second version of the Surfr for the Samsung&#174; Galaxy S&#174; III, which provides 85% additional battery life. 

In December 2012, we launched the EnerPlex Kickr&#8482; and EnerPlex Jumpr&#8482; product series. The Kickr IV is an extremely portable, compact and durable solar charging device, approximately seven inches by seven inches when folded, and weighs less than half a pound. The Kickr IV provides 6.5 watts of regulated power that can help charge phones, digital cameras, and other small USB enabled devices. The Kickr IV is ideal for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking and mountain climbing as well as daily city use. To complement the Kickr IV, we also released the Jumpr series of portable power banks in December of 2012. The Jumpr series provides a compact power storage solution for those who need to recharge their portable electronics while on the go. 

During 2013, the EnerPlex brand rapidly expanded with the addition of two new product series as well as over fifteen new products. In 2013, we introduced further additions to the Jumpr line of portable power banks; releasing the Jumpr Mini and Jumpr Stack in August and the Jumpr Max in September. The latest additions to the Kickr line of portable solar chargers, the Kickr I and Kickr II, were introduced in August at the Outdoor Retailer show. Furthermore, in October 2013, we released our first series of solar integrated backpacks, the EnerPlex Packr&#8482;. The Packr is a functional backpack ideal for charging mobile electronic devices while on the go. Also in October of 2013, we introduced the Surfr battery and solar case for the Samsung Galaxy S&#174; 4, and in December, we introduced the Surfr battery and solar case for Apple&#8217;s iPhone&#174; 5. To complement our flagship product lines, we added an assortment of accessories, all of which can be integrated into the EnerPlex ecosystem of products; such as the LED wand which can be easily plugged into a Jumpr power bank to provide hours of light, or the Travel Adaptor, which enables consumers to charge up their Jumpr power banks from a traditional outlet anywhere in the world. 

&#32;In 2013, we aggressively pursued new distribution channels for the EnerPlex brand; these activities have led to placement in a variety of high-traffic ecommerce venues such as www.amazon.com, www.walmart.com, www.brookstone.com, www.newegg.com as well as many others including our own e-commerce platform at www.goenerplex.com. The April 2013 placement of EnerPlex products at Fry&#8217;s Electronics, a US West Coast consumer electronics retailer, represented the company&#8217;s first domestic retail presence. EnerPlex products are carried in all of Fry&#8217;s 34 superstores across 9 states. In 2015 EnerPlex expanded its relationship with The Cellular Connection ("TCC") to include over 450 Verizon Wireless Premium Retail Stores; in addition to gaining retail placement in Cabela&#8217;s and The Sports Authority&#8217;s brick-and-mortar stores, each a flagship retailer in their respective channels. We have also expanded our products placement globally to include over 170 Maplin Electronics stores in the UK as well as over 25 superstores with Anaconda in Australia. As a result of these retail partnerships and others, EnerPlex retail placement had surpassed over 1,000 stores globally by the end of 2015. 

&#160; 

Throughout 2014, EnerPlex released multiple additions to the Jumpr line of products: including the Jumpr Stack 3, 6 and 9, innovative batteries equipped with tethered micro-USB and Apple Lightning cables and revolutionary Stack and Charge design, enabling batteries to be charged simultaneously when they are placed on top of one another. Also released in 2014 were the Jumpr Slate series, products which push the boundaries of how thin batteries can be, the Jumpr Slate 10k, at less than 7mm thick was the thinnest lithium polymer battery available when it was released. The Jumpr Slate 5k and 5k Lightning each come with a tethered micro-USB and Lightning cable respectively; freeing consumers from worrying about toting extra cables with them while on the move. 

At Outdoor Retailer 2014, EnerPlex debuted the Generatr Series. The Generatr 1200 and Generatr 100 are lithium-ion based large format batteries; lighter and smaller than competitors, the Generatr Series are targeted for consumers who require high-capacity, high-output batteries which remain ultra-portable when compared to the competition. Also debuted at Outdoor Retailer was the Commandr 20, a high output solar charger designed specifically to integrate with and charge the Generatr series, allowing consumers to stay out longer without needing to charge their Generatr batteries from a traditional power source. In August 2014, the Kickr II+ and IV+ were also announced, these products represent another evolution in EnerPlex&#8217;s line of solar products; integrated with a 500mAh battery the Kickr II+ and IV+ are able to provide a constant flow of power even when there are intermittent disruptions in sunlight. 

During the first quarter of 2015 we reached an agreement with EVINE Live, one of the premier home shopping networks with TV programming that reaches over 87 million US homes to begin selling EnerPlex products during their broadcasts. During the second quarter EnerPlex launched the Generatr S100 and select other products exclusively with EVINE, and in the third quarter the Generatr 1200 launched exclusively with EVINE for a limited period. 

During the second quarter of 2015 EnerPlex launched its products into two world recognized retailers; including over 100 The Sports Authority stores nationwide, in addition to launching in select Cabela&#8217;s, &#8220;The World&#8217;s Foremost Outfitter&#8221;, stores and via Cabela&#8217;s online catalog. Internationally, EnerPlex products became available in the United Kingdom via the brand&#8217;s launch with 172 Maplin&#8217;s stores throughout the country. During the forth quarter of 2015, EnerPlex launched with GovX, the premier online shopping destination for Military, Law Enforcement and Government agencies. 

We continue to design and manufacture PV integrated consumer electronics as well as portable power applications for commercial and military users. Due to the high durability enabled by the monolithic integration employed by our technology, the capability to customize modules into different form factors and the industry leading light weight and flexibility provided by our modules, we believe that the potential applications for our products are numerous. 

Commercialization and Manufacturing Strategy 

We manufacture our products by affixing a thin CIGS layer to a flexible, plastic substrate using a large format, roll-to-roll process that permits us to fabricate our flexible PV modules in an integrated sequential operation. We use proprietary monolithic integration techniques which enable us to form complete PV modules with less or no costly back end assembly of inter cell connections. Traditional PV manufacturers assemble PV modules by bonding or soldering discrete PV cells together. This manufacturing step typically increases manufacturing costs and at times proves detrimental to the overall yield and reliability of the finished product. By reducing or eliminating this added step using our proprietary monolithic integration techniques, we believe we can achieve cost savings in, and increase the reliability of, our PV modules. All tooling necessary for us to meet our near term production requirements is installed in our Thornton, Colorado plant. In 2012, we further revised our strategy to focus on applications for emerging and high-value specialty PV markets, including off grid, aerospace, military and defense and consumer oriented products. 

On February 1, 2012, we announced the appointment of Victor Lee as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lee has served on our Board since November 2011. Mr. Lee is the Managing Director of Tertius Financial Group Pte Ltd, the joint venture partner with Radiant Group in TFG Radiant. 

The addition of TFG Radiant as a major shareholder in August 2011 has significantly improved our capabilities on a number of fronts. TFG Radiant's domicile in Shenzhen, China provides us access to high quality, low cost contract manufacturing in Asia through the expansion of TFG Radiant's existing relationships developed through many years of successful operation in China. Integrating these suppliers into our supply chain enables us to bring our products to market faster. TFG Radiant also provides a global product perspective that significantly improves the product design activities of our Thornton, Colorado designers as they collaborate with designers in Asia. We continue to integrate and improve the design-to-manufacture process where we manufacture modules in our US plant, ship them to Asia for completion into finished goods at low cost and then ship products to all markets we will serve. 

&#32;We plan to continue the development of our PV technology in order to increase module efficiency, improve our manufacturing tooling and process capabilities and reduce manufacturing costs. We also plan to continue to take advantage of research and development contracts to fund a portion of this development. 

Advantages of CIGS on a Flexible Plastic Substrate 

Thin film PV solutions differ based on the type of semiconductor material chosen to act as a sunlight absorbing layer, and also on the type of substrate on which the sunlight absorbing layer is affixed. To the best of our knowledge, we believe we are the only company in the world currently focused on commercial scale production of PV modules using CIGS on a flexible, plastic substrate with monolithic integration. We utilize CIGS as a semiconductor material because, at the laboratory level, it has a higher demonstrated cell conversion efficiency than amorphous silicon (&#8220;a-Si&#8221;) and cadmium telluride (&#8220;CdTe&#8221;). We also believe CIGS offers other compelling advantages over both a-Si and CdTe, including: 

&#8226; 

CIGS versus a-Si: Although a-Si, like CIGS, can be deposited on a flexible substrate, its conversion efficiency, which already is generally much lower than that of CIGS, measurably degrades when it is exposed to ultraviolet light, including natural sunlight. To mitigate such degradation, manufacturers of a-Si solar cells are required to implement measures that add cost and complexity to their manufacturing processes. 

&#8226; 

CIGS versus CdTe: Although CdTe modules have achieved conversion efficiencies that are generally comparable to CIGS in production, we believe CdTe has never been successfully applied to a flexible substrate on a commercial scale. We believe the use of CdTe on a rigid, transparent substrate, such as glass, makes CdTe unsuitable for a number of the applications. We also believe CIGS can achieve higher conversion efficiencies than CdTe in production. 

Our choice of substrate material further differentiates us from other thin film PV manufacturers. We believe the use of a flexible, lightweight, insulating substrate that is easier to install provides clear advantages for our target markets, especially where 

rigid substrates are unsuitable. We also believe our use of a flexible, plastic substrate provides us significant cost advantages because it enables us to employ monolithic integration techniques on larger components, which we believe are unavailable to manufacturers who use flexible, metal substrates. Accordingly, we are able to significantly reduce part count, thereby reducing the need for costly back end assembly of inter cell connections. As the only company, to our knowledge, focused on the commercial production of PV modules using CIGS on a flexible, plastic substrate with monolithic integration, we believe we have the opportunity to address the consumer electronics, defense, aerospace, transportation, off grid, portable power and other weight-sensitive markets with transformational high quality, value added product applications. It is these same unique features and our overall manufacturing process that enables us to produce consumer products that enables our consumer products to be extremely robust, light and flexible. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe we possess a number of competitive strengths that provide us with an advantage over our competitors. 

&#8226; 

We are a pioneer in CIGS technology with a proprietary, flexible, lightweight, high efficiency PV thin film product that positions us to penetrate a wide range of attractive high value added markets such as consumer products, off grid, portable power, transportation, defense, aerial, and other markets. &#32;By applying CIGS to a flexible plastic substrate, we have developed a PV module that is efficient, lightweight and flexible; with the highest power-to-weight ratio in at-scale commercially available solar. The market for electronic components, such as electronic packages, casings and accessories, as well as defense portable power systems, transportation integrated applications and space and near-space solar power application solutions represent a significant premium market for the company. Relative to our thin film competitors, we believe our advantage in thin film CIGS on plastic technology provides us with a superior product offering for these strategic market segments. 

&#8226; 

We have the ability to manufacture PV modules for different markets and for customized applications without altering our production processes. &#32;Our ability to produce PV modules in customized shapes and sizes, or in a variety of shapes and sizes simultaneously, without interrupting production flow, provides us with flexibility in addressing target markets and product applications, and allows us to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Many of our competitors are limited by their technology and/or their manufacturing processes to a more restricted set of product opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Our integrated, roll-to-roll manufacturing process and proprietary monolithic integration techniques provide us a potential cost advantage over our competitors. &#32;Historically, manufacturers have formed PV modules by manufacturing individual solar cells and then interconnecting them. Our large format, roll-to-roll manufacturing process allows for integrated continuous production. In addition, our proprietary monolithic integration techniques allow us to utilize laser patterning to create interconnects, thereby creating PV modules at the same time we create PV cells. In so doing, we are able to reduce or eliminate an entire back end processing step, saving time as well as labor and manufacturing costs relative to our competitors. 

&#8226; 

Our lightweight, powerful, and durable solar panels provide a performance advantage over our competitors. &#32;&#32;For consumer applications where a premium is placed on the weight and profile of the product such as phone cases , our ability to integrate our PV modules into portable packages and cases that offer the customer a lightweight and durable solution for all their portable electronics. 

&#8226; 

Our strategic relationship with TFG Radiant provides us with direct access to a potentially large customer base in the East Asia market, sophisticated low cost contract manufacturing suppliers and consumer product design capability. &#32;TFG Radiant is a joint venture between Radiant Group, a Chinese conglomerate in construction and real estate, and Tertius Financial Group, a private investment firm based in Singapore. The combined entity, with more than 3,000 personnel, operates various businesses across China, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, including metal roofing and facades, import/export trading, real estate investment, project management and consultation, new energy development, manufacturing and distribution and gold mining. 

&#8226; 

Our proven research and development capabilities position us to continue the development of next generation PV modules and technologies. &#32;Our ability to produce CIGS based PV modules on a flexible plastic substrate is the result of a concerted research and development effort that began more than twenty years ago. We continue to pursue research and development in an effort to drive efficiency improvements in our current PV modules and to work toward next generation technologies and additional applications. 

&#8226; 

Our manufacturing process can be differentiated into two distinct functions; a front end module manufacturing process and a back end packaging process. &#32;Our ability to produce finished unpackaged rolls of CIGS material for shipment worldwide to customers for encapsulation and integration into various products enhances our ability to work with partners internationally and domestically. 

Markets and Marketing Strategy 

In 2012, we modified our strategic focus away from large scale utility projects and rooftop applications to consumer products and high-value specialty solar markets. This new strategy enables us to fully leverage the unique advantages of our technology including flexibility, durability and attractive power to weight and power to area performance. It furthermore enables us to offer unique, differentiated solutions in large markets with less competition, and more attractive pricing. In the second half of 2012, we launched our EnerPlex line of personal power, portable solar solutions and accessories. This represented a significant paradigm shift for us and moved us into the realm of supplying complete consumer product solutions as opposed to strictly commercial solar modules. We also remain focused on specialty solar applications which can fully leverage the unique properties of our award winning CIGS technology. These include aerospace, military and transportation applications. 

The EnerPlex consumer market is divided into three verticals: Mobile, Outdoor and Emergency Power. Each consumer segment within the verticals has a set of differentiated power needs; depending on multiple factors such as: time away from the outlet, devices used etc. Unlike competitors in the portable power industry, EnerPlex succeeds in supplying power solutions across all three verticals, a core differentiator. 

Our marketing efforts in 2016 will be primarily focused on expanding consumer awareness of our EnerPlex brand and driving revenue through the retail and distribution partnerships built over the last three years. The EnerPlex&#8482; brand presently includes solar and battery integrated smartphone cases (EnerPlex Surfr&#8482;), portable outdoor foldable solar chargers (EnerPlex Kickr&#8482;), ruggedized heavy-duty solar charges (EnerPlex Commandr&#8482;), solar integrated backpacks (EnerPlex Packr&#8482;), portable rechargeable power banks (EnerPlex Jumpr&#8482;), portable heavy-duty batteries (EnerPlex Generatr&#8482;), and complimentary accessories such as travel adapters, bluetooth speakers and other power accessories. These products serve a variety of consumers requiring clean and practical, range extending power solutions for electronic devices either indoors or out. Target consumers include frequent travelers, students, business professionals and those spending extended time outdoors away from the power grid (hunters, campers, park rangers, miners, construction workers, etc.). 

Our EnerPlex&#8482; sales strategy includes direct sales relationships, large retailers, as well as through distributors who serve retailers. We are establishing key distributor relationships throughout the world, by territory, typically on a nonexclusive basis. In 2016, we plan to continue our expansion of distribution channels both in the U.S. and internationally. In early 2013, we established our e-commerce presence through www.goenerplex.com, where our retail customers can purchase our EnerPlex&#8482; products and have them delivered directly from our warehouse. Our products are also available on a variety of third party e-commerce sites including www.amazon.com, www.bestbuy.com, www.walmart.com, www.newegg.com, www.frys.com, www.cabelas.com and several others. 

In the high value specialty PV markets segment, our modules can provide lightweight, high performance, durable power solutions for commercial transportation, automotive, aerospace, military and light-weight off grid structures. In 2013, we were chosen to partner with Volvo for their Pure Tension Pavilion project where our revolutionary, flexible and lightweight CIGS solar modules were selected for integration into the Pavilion&#8217;s tensioned mesh membrane structure. The Volvo&#8217;s Solar Pavilion was ultimately awarded the 25 Best Inventions of the Year 2013 by http://techland.time.com. 

The integration of space, near space, and aeronautic applications with ultra-lightweight and flexible solar modules is an additional large market opportunity for the Company. Customers in this market have historically required a high level of durability and conversion efficiency from solar module suppliers, and we believe our products are well suited to compete in this premium market. In May 2014, together with our partners, Silent Falcon UAS Technologies (SFUAS) and Bye Aerospace, we announced the successful first flight of a production version of the Silent Falcon&#8482; Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) powered by Ascent&#8217;s ultra-lightweight, flexible PV modules. In July 2014, our ultra-lightweight, flexible PV modules were selected by Vanguard Space Technologies (Vanguard) for their NASA Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program. The NASA program is intended to develop an economical, lightweight alternative to existing and emerging high-cost solar arrays for high-power space applications. We expect opportunities in this segment to develop rapidly due to customers' extensive development, testing and evaluation processes. 

In 2015 Ascent Solar won its second R&#38;D 100 Award, the 2015 award was given for the development of the MilPak platform, a military-grade solar power generation and storage unit. The MilPak platform is one of the most rugged, yet lightweight, power generation and storage solutions available, both attributes enabled by the use of Ascent&#8217;s CIGS technology. 

The military market has a unique set of requirements we believe are well suited to our products. When integrated with fabric to form re-deployable arrays, our highly efficient, rugged, lightweight modules may allow soldiers to minimize battery loads, reduce the use of conventional fuels, and increase safety through the streamlining of fuel transport operations. We are also working to expand our foldable line of outdoor solar chargers which are well suited for the individual soldier or for the bigger power needs of a platoon with the ability of several chargers to be strung together. Our modules can also provide a reliable source of renewable 

power in remote areas, regardless of local infrastructure. We will continue to reach the military market primarily through partnerships with top systems providers and the completion of our product listing on the Government Services Administration (GSA) price schedule. Transportation integrated PV, or integration of our flexible solar modules with vehicles such as commercial trucks, buses, trains and passenger cars, is another market segment that represents a significant opportunity. Due to their flexible form and durable, lightweight properties, our modules can be fitted to the exterior of various vehicles to provide supplemental power without significantly affecting the aerodynamics, weight or aesthetics of the vehicle. We are currently working with multiple integrators and OEMs to develop effective value added solutions for this market. 

We continue to supply our strategic partners with PV modules to support their development, testing and certification of new integrated PV products, including product testing by several branches of the U.S. military. We believe that our high power density flexible solar modules enable new applications for solar power. By creating mutually beneficial partnerships and strategically penetrating the markets discussed above, we plan to transform the landscape of solar power generation with truly innovative end products. 

Competition 

We have shifted our strategic focus away from large scale utility projects of the traditional solar markets. We believe our thin film, monolithically integrated CIGS technology enables us to deliver sleek, lightweight, rugged, high performance solutions to serve these markets as competitors from other thin film and c-Si companies emerge. The landscape of thin film manufacturers encompasses a broad mix of technology platforms at various stages of development, and consists of a number of medium and small companies. From 2011 to 2013, the PV industry landscape changed significantly. According to NPD Solarbuzz, Yingli Green Energy maintained leading module supplier ranking in 2013, with Trina Solar competing strongly for the second position. Seven of the top ten producers, and four of the top five, were crystalline silicon manufacturers based in China. Companies currently developing or selling CIGS-based PV modules include Avancis GmbH &#38; Co. KG, Flisom AG, Nuvosun, Inc., Solibro GmbH, Solarion AG, Solar Frontier and Hanergy Holding Group. A number of manufacturers that traditionally have manufactured and sold c-Si-based modules have entered, or in the future may enter, the market for thin film PV modules, and potentially, CIGS-based PV modules. These efforts have been initiated both through internal development and through acquisition of companies, or the purchase of turnkey solutions offered by PV equipment providers. 

The market for traditional, grid connected PV products is dominated by large manufacturers of c-Si technology, although thin film technology on glass has begun to emerge among the major players. We anticipate that while these large manufacturers may continue to dominate the market with their silicon based products, thin film manufacturers will likely capture an increasingly larger share of the market, as is evident from the success of First Solar (CdTe) and Solar Frontier (CIGS), both among the top 20 producers worldwide. In 2012, the five largest PV manufacturers included: Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. Ltd. (China), First Solar (US), Suntech Power Holdings Co., Ltd. (China), Trina Solar (China) and Canadian Solar (Canada). In 2012, crystalline silicon PV technology represented approximately 90% of global market share, a slight increase over 2011 at 88%, with the balance captured by thin film. In 2013, the five largest PV module suppliers included: Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. Ltd. (China), Trina Solar (China), Sharp Solar (Japan), Canadian Solar (Canada), and Jinko Solar (China). According to the Fraunhofer Institute Photovoltaics Report, Si-wafer based PV technology accounted for about 90 % of the total production in 2013. The remainder of the production is captured by thin film, with CdTe production accounting for 54% of the thin film production and CIGS and a-Si splitting the remainder with 23% each. 

We believe that our modules offer unique advantages. Their flexibility and high power density enable use on weight-sensitive applications, such as portable power, conformal aircraft surfaces, and space applications that are unsuitable for glass-based modules. Innovative product design and customer focused development both yield modules that could be integrated into virtually any product to create a source of renewable energy. Whether compared to glass based or other flexible modules, our products offer competitive advantages making them unique in comparison to competing products. 

We define the consumer and portable power space as comprising solar powered solutions in the sub-single watt range (i.e. smartphone solar chargers) all the way up to the several hundred watts of power range (i.e., outdoor solar chargers for camping, military or outdoor work). Competitors in the consumer products space include companies that design and distribute solar charging solutions but outsource manufacturing. These include Goal Zero, Voltaic, A-Solar, Solio, PowerTraveller, Solar Components and RDK Products. Mono or polycrystalline silicon solar technologies are common in these products. Other competitors in this segment include thin-film solar manufacturers who provide a complete product under their company name or brand. These companies include Global Solar Energy (Sunlinq brand), PowerFilm, Trony and more recently Alta Devices. Competitors in the phone case with supplemental charging market include Mophie, Tylt, MyCharge and Powerskin. Competitors in the power bank market include Mophie, Energizer, MyCharge and Tenergy. We believe our differentiated technology lends itself to delivering competitive solutions in the emerging market for personal and portable solar and non-solar charging solutions. 

Research and Development and Intellectual Property 

We intend to continue to invest in research and development in order to provide near term improvements to our manufacturing process and products, as well as to identify next generation technologies relevant to both our existing and potential new markets. During 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;we incurred approximately $6.7 million &#32;and $18.8 million &#32;respectively, in research and development costs, which include research and development incurred in relation to our government contracts, as well as manufacturing costs incurred while developing our product lines and manufacturing process. 

Our technology was initially developed at ITN beginning in 1994. In early 2006, ITN assigned to us certain CIGS PV-specific technologies, and granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free, worldwide license to use these technologies in connection with the manufacture, development, marketing and commercialization of CIGS PV to produce solar power. In addition, certain of ITN&#8217;s existing and future proprietary process and control technologies, although nonspecific to CIGS PV, were assigned to us. ITN retained the right to conduct research and development activities in connection with PV materials, and we agreed to grant a license back to ITN for improvements to the licensed technologies and intellectual property outside of the CIGS PV field. 

We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trade secrets and patent protections. We own the following patents and published patent applications:

Suppliers 

We rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain raw materials used during the fabrication of our PV modules and PV integrated electronics. We acquire these materials on a purchase order basis and do not have long term purchase quantity commitments with the suppliers, although we may enter into such contracts in the future. We currently acquire all of our high temperature plastic from one supplier, although alternative suppliers of similar materials exist. We purchase component molybdenum, copper, indium, gallium, selenium and indium tin oxides from a variety of suppliers. We also currently are in the process of identifying and negotiating arrangements with alternative suppliers of materials in the United States and Asia. 

The manufacturing equipment and tools used in our production process have been purchased from various suppliers in Europe, the United States and Asia. Although we have had good relations with our existing equipment and tools suppliers, we monitor and explore opportunities for developing alternative sources to drive our manufacturing costs down. 

Our consumer products are delivered to us as finished goods from a variety of contract manufacturers in Asia. For those products that include PV modules we provide the modules to the contract manufacturers who then return the modules integrated into the finished product. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 119 full time employees. 

Company History 

We were formed in October 2005 from the separation by ITN of its Advanced Photovoltaic Division and all of that division&#8217;s key personnel and core technologies. ITN, a private company incorporated in 1994, is an incubator dedicated to the development of thin film, PV, battery, fuel cell and nano technologies. Through its work on research and development contracts for private and government entities, ITN developed proprietary processing and manufacturing know-how applicable to PV products generally, and to CIGS PV products in particular. Our company was established by ITN to commercialize its investment in CIGS PV technologies. In January 2006, ITN assigned to us all its CIGS PV technologies and trade secrets and granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, royalty free worldwide license to use certain of ITN&#8217;s proprietary process, control and design technologies in the production of CIGS PV modules. Upon receipt of the necessary government approvals in January 2007, ITN assigned government funded research and development contracts to us and also transferred the key personnel working on the contracts to us.
