 Item 1. BUSINESS. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, &#8220;G-III&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries. References to fiscal years refer to the year ended or ending on January 31 of that year. For example, our fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 is referred to as &#8220;fiscal 2016.&#8221; 

All share and per share data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to reflect our two-for-one stock split effected on May 1, 2015. 

Overview 

G-III designs, manufactures and markets an extensive range of apparel, including outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women&#8217;s suits and women&#8217;s performance wear, as well as women&#8217;s handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. We sell our products under our own proprietary brands, licensed brands and private retail labels. 

G-III sells swimwear, resort wear and related accessories under our own Vilebrequin brand and footwear, apparel and accessories under our own Bass and G.H. Bass brands. We also sell a variety of apparel products under our other owned brands that include Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Jessica Howard, Eliza J and Black Rivet and under private retail labels. 

We sell products under an extensive portfolio of well-known licensed brands, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld, Kenneth Cole, Guess?, Levi&#8217;s and Cole Haan. In our team sports business, we have licenses with the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, Touch by Alyssa Milano, Hands High and over 100 U.S. colleges and universities. 

Our products are sold through a cross section of leading retailers such as Macy&#8217;s, Bloomingdale&#8217;s, Nordstrom, Lord &#38; Taylor, Dillard&#8217;s, The Bon-Ton Stores, Saks Fifth Avenue and JC Penney. 

We also distribute apparel and other products through our own retail stores. Substantially all of our Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores are operated as outlet stores. As of January 31, 2016, we operated 199 Wilsons Leather stores and 163 G.H. Bass stores, as well as 5 Calvin Klein Performance stores, in 43 states and Puerto Rico.

In February 2016, we expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger through a new license agreement for Tommy Hilfiger womenswear in the United States and Canada, which includes women&#8217;s sportswear, suit separates, performance and denim. These categories are in addition to dresses, men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s outerwear and luggage that were already licensed to us by Tommy Hilfiger. The new license agreement has an initial term of five years and a renewal term of four years. Macy&#8217;s will continue to be the principal retailer of Tommy Hilfiger in the United States and women&#8217;s sportswear will continue to be a Macy&#8217;s exclusive offering. 

In October 2015, we announced the launch of Hands High, a new licensed sports apparel line inspired by Tonight Show host, Jimmy Fallon. Hands High features professional team logos from the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL that are located under a fan&#8217;s arms. Hands High product was launched in October 2015 at retailers throughout the country, as well as at official team and stadium shops and official league websites. 

We have acquired businesses that have broadened our product offerings, expanded our ability to serve different tiers of distribution and added a retail component to our business. Our acquisitions are part of our strategy to expand our product offerings and increase the portfolio of proprietary and licensed brands that we offer through different tiers of retail distribution. 

In June 2015, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Karl Lagerfeld Group BV. We acquired a 49% ownership interest in KL North America BV (&#8220;KLNA&#8221;), an entity that holds brand rights to Karl Lagerfeld trademarks for all consumer products (except eyewear, fragrance, cosmetics, watches, jewelry, and hospitality services) and apparel in the United States and Canada. In addition, the entity was granted an exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use the trademarks in Mexico with respect to the same products. G-III is also the first licensee of the joint venture and has been granted a five year license (with two renewals of five years each) for women&#8217;s apparel, women&#8217;s handbags and men&#8217;s outerwear. We began shipping Karl Lagerfeld sportswear, dresses, women&#8217;s outerwear and handbags in the third quarter of fiscal 

2016 and Karl Lagerfeld women&#8217;s footwear in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. In February 2016, we expanded our partnership with respect to the Karl Lagerfeld brand through the acquisition of an approximately 19% minority interest in the parent of the Karl Lagerfeld entities that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. 

In November 2013, we acquired the business of G.H. Bass &#38; Co., a well-known heritage brand that developed the iconic original penny loafer (known as &#8220;Weejuns&#8221;). Bass footwear, apparel and accessories are sold primarily through our G.H. Bass outlet stores located in the United States. The brand is also licensed for the wholesale distribution of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s footwear, men&#8217;s sportswear and men&#8217;s and boy&#8217;s tailored clothing. 

In August 2012, we acquired Vilebrequin, a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. As of January 31, 2016, Vilebrequin products were distributed in the United States and over 50 countries worldwide through 81 Company-owned stores, as well as through 65 franchise partners locations and select wholesale distribution. Vilebrequin has also licensed its brand for the wholesale distribution of footwear and recently signed a license agreement for a line of sunglasses that is expected to commence distribution in 2017. 

Starting with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we began reporting based on two segments: wholesale operations and retail operations. This change in our reportable segments is intended to better represent how our resources are allocated and our performance is assessed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker. The wholesale operations segment consists of our former licensed products and non-licensed products segments and includes sales of products under brands licensed by us from third parties, as well as sales of products under our own brands and private label brands. The retail operations segment consists primarily of our Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores, as well as a limited number of Calvin Klein Performance stores. See Note K to our Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information with respect to these segments. 

G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. is a Delaware corporation that was formed in 1989. We and our predecessors have conducted our business since 1974. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that our broad portfolio of high-profile brands combined with our extensive distribution relationships position us for growth. We intend to capitalize on the following competitive strengths in order to expand our position as an all-season diversified apparel company: 

Broad portfolio of recognized brands. We have built a broad and deep portfolio of over 40 licensed and proprietary brands. We believe we are a licensee of choice for well-known brands, as demonstrated by our partnerships with such brands as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Karl Lagerfeld, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, Cole Haan, Dockers and Levi&#8217;s, that have built a loyal following of both fashion-conscious consumers and retailers who desire high quality, well designed products. We have selectively added the licensing rights to premier brands in women&#8217;s, men&#8217;s and team sports categories catering to a wide range of customers. In addition to our licensed brands, we own several successful proprietary brands, including Vilebrequin, Bass, G.H. Bass, Weejuns, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J, Jessica Howard and Black Rivet. In an environment of rapidly changing consumer fashion trends, we benefit from a balanced mix of well-established and newer brands. Our experience in developing and acquiring licensed brands and proprietary labels, as well as our reputation for producing high quality, well-designed apparel, has led major department stores and retailers to select us as a designer and manufacturer for their private label programs. 

We currently market apparel and other products under, among others, the following licensed and proprietary brand names:

Bass &#8203; &#8203; Black Rivet &#8203; &#8203; Black Rivet &#8203; &#8203; Wilsons &#8203; &#8203; Wilsons &#8203; &#8203; Eliza J &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Jessica Howard &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Diversified distribution base. We market our products at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution, allowing us to provide products to a broad range of consumers. Our products are sold to approximately 2,800 customers, including a cross section of retailers such as Macy&#8217;s, TJX Companies, Ross Stores, Lord &#38; Taylor, Dillard&#8217;s, the Bon-Ton Stores, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue and JC Penney, as well as membership clubs such as Costco and Sam&#8217;s Club. We believe our strong relationships with retailers have been established through many years of personal customer service and adherence to meeting or exceeding retailer expectations. Our Wilsons Leather retail stores provide an additional distribution network for our products. We distribute our Bass and G.H. Bass products through our Bass outlet stores and through licensees, and distribute Vilebrequin products through a network of company owned and franchised specialty retail stores and shops, as well as through select wholesale distribution channels. 

Superior design, sourcing and quality control. Our in-house design and merchandising teams design substantially all of our licensed, proprietary and private label products. Our designers work closely with our licensors and private label customers to create designs and styles that represent the look they want. We have a network of worldwide suppliers that allows us to negotiate competitive terms without relying on any single vendor. In addition, we employ a quality control team and a sourcing group in China to ensure the 

quality of our products. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of our design capabilities, sourcing expertise, on-time delivery and high standards of quality control. Our acquisition of Vilebrequin added experienced design capability and additional sourcing resources. With its distinctive product design and construction, Vilebrequin, unlike the rest of our business, mostly relies on a limited number of manufacturers for the substantial majority of its product. 

Leadership position in the wholesale business. As one of the largest wholesalers of outerwear, dresses and sportswear, we are widely recognized within the apparel industry for our high-quality and well-designed products. Our expertise and reputation in designing, manufacturing and marketing apparel have enabled us to build strong customer relationships and to become one of the leading dress suppliers in the United States over the past several years. We have also expanded into women&#8217;s performance wear and other apparel categories, as well as to non-apparel categories such as handbags, footwear, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. 

Experienced management team. Our executive management team has worked together for a significant period of time and has extensive experience in the apparel industry. Morris Goldfarb, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, has been with us for over 40 years. Sammy Aaron, our Vice Chairman, joined us in 2005 when we acquired Marvin Richards, Wayne S. Miller, our Chief Operating Officer, has been with us for over 15 years and Neal S. Nackman, our Chief Financial Officer, has been with us for over 10 years. Each of our executive officers has over 30 years of experience in the apparel business. Our leadership team has demonstrated experience in successfully acquiring, managing, integrating and positioning new businesses having completed eight acquisitions over the last ten years, while also adding numerous new licensed products. 

Growth Strategy 

Our goal is to continue to expand our position as an all-season diversified apparel company with a broad portfolio of brands that we offer in multiple channels of retail distribution through the following growth strategies: 

Execute diversification initiatives. We are continually seeking opportunities to produce products for all seasons. We have initiated the following diversification efforts: 

&#8226; 

In February 2016, we expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger through a new license for womenswear which includes sportswear, suit separates, performance and denim. These categories are in addition to our existing licenses for Tommy Hilfiger dresses, men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s outerwear and luggage. We believe that Tommy Hilfiger is an iconic American brand. We intend to leverage our market expertise to help build sales of Tommy Hilfiger women&#8217;s appeal. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

In June 2015, we entered into a joint venture pursuant to which we acquired a 49% ownership interest in an entity that holds brand rights to the Karl Lagerfeld trademarks for consumer products (with certain exceptions) and apparel in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We are also the first licensee of the joint venture, having been granted a license for women&#8217;s apparel, women&#8217;s handbags and men&#8217;s outerwear. In February 2016, we expanded our partnership with respect to the Karl Lagerfeld brand through the acquisition of an approximately 19% minority interest in the parent company of the group that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

In November 2013, we acquired G.H. Bass, a well-known heritage brand that sells footwear, apparel and accessories. This acquisition continued the diversification of our product offerings and expanded the scope of our retail business that started with our acquisition of Wilsons in 2008. Since acquiring Bass, we have added licenses for Bass footwear and retail in Europe, men&#8217;s sportswear and men&#8217;s and boy&#8217;s tailored clothing. In addition, in March 2015, we entered into a wholesale license agreement with Genesco to design, distribute, and market G.H. Bass men&#8217;s, women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s footwear in the United States and Canada. We believe Genesco&#8217;s expertise and market leadership in footwear will complement our G.H. Bass team. This initiative is part of our plan to continue to revitalize and build the G.H. Bass heritage brand through improved assortments and additional category licenses with strong partners. 

&#8203;

&#8203;

&#8226; 

We have continually expanded our relationship with Calvin Klein. Initially, we had licenses for Calvin Klein men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s outerwear. Between 2005 and 2011, we added licenses for women&#8217;s suits, dresses, women&#8217;s performance wear, women&#8217;s better sportswear, women&#8217;s handbags and small leather goods, and luggage, as well as to operate Calvin Klein Performance retail stores in the United States. We also added a license for Calvin Klein men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s swimwear that became effective as of December 1, 2013. In March 2014, the current term of each of our Calvin Klein license agreements was extended to December 31, 2023. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

In August 2012, we acquired Vilebrequin, a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. We believe that Vilebrequin is a powerful brand and will continue adding more company owned and franchised retail locations and increase our wholesale distribution throughout the world, as well as develop the business beyond its heritage in men&#8217;s swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. 

&#8203;

Continue to grow our apparel business. We have been a leader in the apparel business for many years and believe we can continue to grow our apparel business. Specifically, our Calvin Klein businesses benefit from Calvin Klein&#8217;s strong brand awareness and loyalty among consumers. Our acquisition of Andrew Marc added two well-known proprietary brands in the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s apparel market, as well as licenses for men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s outerwear under the Levi&#8217;s and Dockers brands. More recently, we added licenses for womenswear, outerwear and dresses under the Tommy Hilfiger brand and for a variety of apparel products under the Kensie and Ivanka Trump brands. 

Add new product categories. We have been able to leverage our expertise and experience in the apparel business, our relationships with our licensors and our sourcing capabilities to expand our licenses to new product categories such as dresses, sportswear, women&#8217;s suits, women&#8217;s performance wear, footwear and men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s swimwear. We expanded our licenses with Calvin Klein beyond apparel categories to include women&#8217;s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. In addition, we added luggage to the products we sell under the Tommy Hilfiger brand and added swimwear, resort wear and related accessories as a result of our acquisition of Vilebrequin. Our acquisition of G.H. Bass added footwear to our product mix. We will attempt to expand our distribution of products in these and other categories under licensed brands, our own brands and private label brands. 

Seek attractive acquisitions. We plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines and businesses. We continually review acquisition opportunities. Most recently, we acquired a 49% interest in a joint venture that holds brand rights to the Karl Lagerfeld trademarks for consumer products (with certain exceptions) and apparel in the United States, Canada and Mexico, as well as an approximately 19% minority interest in the parent company of the group that holds the worldwide rights to the Karl Lagerfeld brand. We acquired G.H. Bass, a well-known heritage brand that operates 150 outlet stores, and Vilebrequin, which provides us with a premier brand selling status products worldwide. As a result of other acquisitions, we added name-brand licenses, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Guess?, Ellen Tracy, Levi&#8217;s and Dockers, as well as proprietary labels and private label programs. We acquired our Jessica Howard and Eliza J dress businesses and Andrew Marc, each of which added to our portfolio of proprietary brands. We also acquired the Wilsons Leather outlet store business. Our acquisitions have increased our portfolio of licensed and proprietary brands, allowed us to realize economies of scale and added a retail component to our business. We believe that our existing infrastructure and management depth will enable us to complete additional acquisitions in the apparel industry. 

Products &#8212;&#8201;Development and Design 

G-III designs, manufactures and markets women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s apparel at a wide range of retail price points. Our product offerings primarily include outerwear, dresses, sportswear, swimwear, women&#8217;s suits and women&#8217;s performance wear. We also market footwear and accessories including women&#8217;s handbags, small leather goods, cold weather accessories and luggage. 

G-III&#8217;s licensed apparel consists of both women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s products in a broad range of categories. See &#8220;Business&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Licensing.&#8221; Our strategy is to seek licenses that will enable us to offer a range of products targeting different price points and different distribution channels. We also offer a wide range of products under our own proprietary brands. 

We work with a diversified group of retail chains, such as Express, Kohl&#8217;s and JC Penney in developing product lines that are sold under their private label programs. Our design teams collaborate with our customers to produce custom made products for department and specialty chain stores. Store buyers may provide samples to us or may select styles already available in our showrooms. We believe we have established a reputation among these buyers for our ability to produce high quality product on a reliable, expeditious and cost-effective basis. 

Our in-house designers are responsible for the design and look of our licensed and non-licensed products. We work closely with our licensors to create designs and styles for each of our licensed brands. Licensors generally must approve products to be sold under their brand names prior to production. We maintain a global pulse on styles, using trend services and color services to enable us to quickly respond to style changes in the apparel industry. Our experienced design personnel and our focused use of outside services enable us to incorporate current trends and consumer preferences in designing new products and styles. 

Our design personnel meet regularly with our sales and merchandising departments, as well as with the design and merchandising staffs of our licensors, to review market trends, sales results and the popularity of our latest products. In addition, our representatives regularly attend trade and fashion shows and shop at fashion forward stores in the United States, Europe and the Far East. Our designers present sample items along with their evaluation of the styles expected to be in demand in the United States. We also seek input from selected customers with respect to product design. We believe that our sensitivity to the needs of retailers, coupled with the flexibility of our production capabilities and our continual monitoring of the retail market, enables us to modify designs and order specifications in a timely fashion. 

Wholesale Operations 

Our wholesale operations include sales of products licensed by us from third parties, as well as sales of products under our own proprietary brands and private label brands. Revenues from our wholesale operations accounted for 79.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 compared to 77.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2015 and 83.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2014. 

Licensed Products

The sale of licensed products is a key element of our strategy and we have continually expanded our offerings of licensed products for more than 20 years. We have expanded our relationship with Tommy Hilfiger to include a license for womenswear in February 2016 and for women&#8217;s dresses in April 2015. In June 2015, we entered into a license for Karl Lagerfeld women&#8217;s apparel, women&#8217;s handbags and men&#8217;s outerwear. In October 2015, we announced the launch of Hands High, a new licensed sports apparel line inspired by Tonight Show host, Jimmy Fallon.

The following table sets forth, for each of our principal licenses, the date on which the current term ends and the date on which any potential renewal term ends.

Under our license agreements, we are generally required to achieve minimum net sales of licensed products, pay guaranteed minimum royalties, make specified royalty and advertising payments (usually based on a percentage of net sales of licensed products), and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. License agreements also may restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy any of these requirements or otherwise fail to meet our obligations under a license agreement, a licensor usually will have the right to terminate our license. License agreements also typically restrict our ability to assign or transfer the agreement without the prior written consent of a licensor and generally provide that a change in control, including as a result of the acquisition of us by another company, is considered to be a transfer of the license agreement that would give a licensor the right to terminate the license unless it has approved the transaction. 

Our ability to renew the current term of a license agreement may be subject to the discretion of the licensor or to attaining minimum sales and/or royalty levels and to our compliance with the provisions of the agreement. We believe that brand owners are looking to consolidate the number of licensees they engage to develop product and to choose licensees who have a successful track record of developing brands. We continue to seek other opportunities to enter into license agreements in order to expand our product offerings under well-known labels and broaden the markets that we serve. 

Proprietary Brands

Dating back to the beginning of our company, G-III has sold apparel under our own proprietary brands. Over the years, we developed or acquired brands such as G-III Sports by Carl Banks, Eliza J, Jessica Howard and Black Rivet. Most recently, we acquired G.H. Bass, a well-known heritage brand, and Vilebrequin, which provides us with a premier brand selling status products worldwide. 

Andrew Marc and Marc New York provide us with upscale company-owned brands. We utilize our own in-house capabilities to create our core men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s outerwear and women&#8217;s performance wear. We also license these brands to select third parties in certain categories. 

Vilebrequin is a premier provider of status swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. Vilebrequin sells its products in over 50 countries around the world. Vilebrequin has also licensed its brand for the wholesale distribution of footwear. We believe that Vilebrequin is capable of significant worldwide expansion. A majority of Vilebrequin&#8217;s current revenues are derived from sales in Europe and the United States. As of January 31, 2016, Vilebrequin products were distributed through 81 Company-owned stores, as well as through 65 franchised locations and select wholesale distribution. 

Vilebrequin&#8217;s iconic designs and reputation are linked to its French Riviera heritage arising from its founding in St. Tropez over forty years ago. Vilebrequin&#8217;s men&#8217;s swimwear, which accounts for the majority of its sales, is known for its exclusive prints, wide range of colors, attention to detail, fabric quality and well-designed cut. In addition to swimwear, Vilebrequin sells a line of resort wear products, including shirts, T-shirts, Bermuda shorts and trousers, and related accessories, including hats, beach bags, beach towels and sunglasses. Vilebrequin also sells sandals and a collection of women&#8217;s swimwear and resort wear. We believe that Vilebrequin is a powerful brand. We plan to continue adding more company owned and franchised retail locations and increase our wholesale distribution of Vilebrequin product throughout the world, as well as develop the business beyond its heritage in men&#8217;s swimwear, resort wear and related accessories. 

Retail Operations 

We are a national retailer of outerwear, apparel, footwear and accessories in the United States. As of January 31, 2016, our retail operations segment consisted of 367 retail stores in 43 states and Puerto Rico, of which 199 are stores operated under the Wilsons Leather name, 163 are stores operated under our G.H. Bass brand and 5 stores are operated under the licensed Calvin Klein Performance brand. Substantially all of our Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass stores are operated as outlet stores and located in larger outlet centers with Wilsons Leather&#8217;s stores averaging approximately 3,715 square feet and G.H. Bass stores averaging approximately 5,890 square feet. At January 31, 2016, we operated 18 full price Wilsons Leather mall stores. We currently plan to open approximately 5 new Wilsons Leather outlet stores and 5 new G.H. Bass outlet stores in fiscal 2017. 

Our Wilsons Leather retail stores primarily sell men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s outerwear and accessories. Outerwear sold in our Wilsons Leather stores includes products primarily sourced by us and accessories which are purchased primarily from third parties. Merchandise is shipped from our main Brooklyn Park, Minnesota distribution center, as well as four regional distribution centers, to replenish stores as needed with key styles and to build inventory for the peak holiday selling season. 

Our Bass stores offer casual and dress shoes for men and women. Most of our Bass stores also carry apparel for men and women, including tops, bottoms and outerwear, as well as accessories such as handbags, wallets, belts and travel gear. We sell Bass products primarily through outlet stores located in the United States. 

We also license the Bass brand for the wholesale distribution of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s footwear, men&#8217;s sportswear and men&#8217;s and boy&#8217;s tailored clothing. In March 2015, we entered into a wholesale license agreement with Genesco to design, distribute, and market G.H. Bass men&#8217;s, women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s footwear in the United States and Canada. First shipments are expected for the Spring 2016 season. We believe Genesco&#8217;s expertise and market leadership in footwear will complement our G.H. Bass team. We also used our in-house expertise to produce certain key categories for Bass, including our launch of Bass women&#8217;s apparel in Fall 2015. 

Revenues from our retail operations, before intercompany eliminations, accounted for 20.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 compared to 22.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2015 and 16.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2015 in the percentage of sales from our retail operations resulted from the acquisition of G.H. Bass in November 2013. 

Manufacturing and Sourcing 

G-III arranges for the production of products from independent manufacturers located primarily in China and, to a lesser extent, in Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh and Central and South America. Vilebrequin&#8217;s products are manufactured in Bulgaria, Tunisia and Morocco. A small portion of our garments are manufactured in the United States. 

We currently have representative offices in Hangzhou, Nanjing and Qingdao, China, as well as in Vietnam and Indonesia. These offices act as our liaison with manufacturers in the Far East. As of January 31, 2016, we had 321 employees in these representative offices. 

G-III&#8217;s headquarters provides these liaison offices with production orders stating the quantity, quality, delivery time and types of garments to be produced. The personnel in our liaison offices assist in the negotiation and placement of orders with manufacturers. In allocating production among independent suppliers, we consider a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, quality, availability of production capacity, pricing and ability to meet changing production requirements. 

To facilitate better service for our customers and accommodate the volume of manufacturing in the Far East, we also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong subsidiary supports third party production of products on an agency fee basis. Our Hong Kong office acts as an agent for substantially all of our production. Our China and Hong Kong offices monitor production at manufacturers&#8217; facilities to ensure quality control, compliance with our specifications and timely delivery of finished garments to our distribution facilities and, in some cases, direct to our customers. At January 31, 2016, we had 28 employees in our Hong Kong office. 

In connection with the foreign manufacture of our products, manufacturers purchase raw materials including fabric, wool, leather and other submaterials (such as linings, zippers, buttons and trim) at our direction. Prior to commencing the manufacture of products, samples of raw materials or submaterials are sent to us for approval. We regularly inspect and supervise the manufacture of our products in order to ensure timely delivery, maintain quality control and monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications. We also inspect finished products at the factory site. 

We generally arrange for the production of products on a purchase order basis with completed products manufactured to our design specifications. We assume the risk of loss predominantly on a Freight-On-Board (F.O.B.) basis when goods are delivered to a shipper and are insured against casualty losses arising during shipping. 

As is customary, we have not entered into any long-term contractual arrangements with any contractor or manufacturer. We believe that the production capacity of foreign manufacturers with which we have developed, or are developing, a relationship is adequate to meet our production requirements for the foreseeable future. We believe that alternative foreign manufacturers are readily available. 

A majority of all finished goods manufactured for us is shipped to our New Jersey warehouse and distribution facilities or to designated third party facilities for final inspection and allocation, as well as reshipment to customers. The goods are delivered to our customers and us by independent shippers. We choose the form of shipment (principally ship, truck or air) based upon a customer&#8217;s needs, cost and timing considerations. 

Customs and Import Restrictions 

Our arrangements with textile manufacturers and suppliers are subject to requisite customs clearances for textile apparel and the imposition of export duties. United States Customs duties on our textile apparel presently range from duty free to 32%, depending upon the type of fabric used, how the garment is constructed and the country of export. A substantial majority of our product is imported into the United States and, to a lesser extent, into Canada and Europe. Countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges or other import controls or restrictions or adjust prevailing duty or tariff levels, as well as quota restrictions. Under the provisions of the World Trade Organization (&#8220;WTO&#8221;) agreement governing international trade in textiles, known as the &#8220;WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing,&#8221; the United States and other WTO member countries have eliminated quotas on textiles and apparel-related products from WTO member countries. As a result, quota restrictions generally do not affect our business in most countries. 

Apparel and other products sold by us are also subject to regulations that relate to product labeling, content and safety requirements, licensing requirements and flammability testing. We believe that we are in compliance with those regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. 

Raw Materials 

We purchase most products manufactured for us on a finished goods basis. We coordinate the sourcing of raw materials used in the production of our products which are generally available from numerous sources. The apparel industry competes with manufacturers of many other products for the supply of raw materials. In prior years, the majority of our raw material inventory consisted of leather skins. Until recently, we provided these raw materials to one of our subcontractors in China to manufacture some of our leather products. As this subcontractor is closing down its operations, we did not replenish our leather inventory in fiscal 2016. Going forward, we are planning to work with manufacturers who use their own leather skins inventory. 

Marketing and Distribution 

G-III&#8217;s products are sold primarily to department, specialty and mass merchant retail stores in the United States. We sell to approximately 2,800 customers, ranging from national and regional chains to small specialty stores. We also distribute our products through our retail stores and, to a lesser extent, through our G.H. Bass, Wilsons Leather, Vilebrequin and Andrew Marc websites. 

Sales to our 10 largest customers accounted for 63.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 compared to 58.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2015 and 61.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2014. Sales to Macy&#8217;s, which includes sales to its Macy&#8217;s and Bloomingdale&#8217;s store chains, accounted for an aggregate of 20.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 compared to 18.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2015 and 21.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2014. The loss of this customer or a significant reduction in purchases by our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

A substantial majority of our sales are made in the United States. We also market our products in Canada, Europe and the Far East, which, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 7.9% of our net sales in fiscal 2016. See Note K to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information with respect to revenues and long-lived assets attributed by geographic region. 

G-III&#8217;s products are sold primarily through a direct sales force consisting of 180 employees at January 31, 2016. Our principal executives are also actively involved in sales of our products. Some of our products are also sold by various retail buying offices and independent sales representatives located throughout the United States. Sales outside of the United States are managed by 13 salespeople located in our offices across Asia, as well as 11 salespeople for Kensie located in Canada and 8 salespeople for Vilebrequin located in Switzerland. The Canadian market is serviced by a sales and customer service team based both in the United States and in Canada. 

Brand name products sold by us pursuant to a license agreement are promoted by institutional and product advertisements placed by the licensor. Our license agreements generally require us to pay the licensor a fee, based on a percentage of net sales of licensed product, to pay for a portion of these advertising costs. We may also be required to spend a specified percentage of net sales of a licensed product on advertising placed by us. 

We advertise our Andrew Marc brand and are engaged in both cooperative advertising programs with retailers and direct to the consumer. We are focused on creating an image that will broaden the lifestyle appeal of our Andrew Marc brands. Our marketing strategy is focused on media, public relations and channel marketing. Our media strategy for Andrew Marc includes traditional print and outdoor advertising, as well as digital and social media initiatives. 

Wilsons Leather and G.H. Bass marketing efforts are primarily focused on increasing store traffic and then converting customers to buyers. This goal is mainly accomplished through our customer relations programs, local advertising and mall marketing promotions along with marketing initiatives through the Internet, social media and public relations support. 

Vilebrequin&#8217;s marketing efforts have been based on continually offering new swimwear prints, and expanding the range of its products to new categories such as women&#8217;s swimwear, ready to wear and accessories, while maintaining its core collection. Besides its traditional advertising networks (print and outdoor advertising), Vilebrequin is seeking to develop new marketing channels through the use of digital media, product placement and public relations. Through the growth of its network of stores, distributors and franchisees, Vilebrequin is seeking to reinforce its position in its traditional markets, such as the United States and Europe, and to develop new markets in Asia and the Middle East. 

We believe we have developed awareness of our other owned labels primarily through our reputation, consumer acceptance and the fashion press. We primarily rely on our reputation and relationships to generate business in the private label portion of our wholesale operations segment. We believe we have developed a significant customer following and positive reputation in the industry as a result of, among other things, our standards of quality control, on-time delivery, competitive pricing and willingness and ability to assist customers in their merchandising of our products. 

Seasonality 

Retail sales of outerwear and other apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, we have been dependent on our sales from July through November for the substantial majority of our net sales and net income. Net sales in the months of July through November accounted for approximately 57% of our net sales in fiscal 2016, 56% of our net sales in fiscal 2015 and 57% of our net sales in fiscal 2014. We are highly dependent on our results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year. The second half of the year is expected to continue to provide a disproportionate amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our net income for the foreseeable future. 

Order Book 

A portion of our orders consists of short-term purchase orders from customers who place orders on an as-needed basis. Information relative to open purchase orders at any date may also be materially affected by, among other things, the timing of the initial showing of apparel to the trade, as well as by the timing of recording of orders and shipments. As a result, we do not believe that disclosure of the amount of our unfilled customer orders at any time is meaningful. 

Competition 

We have numerous competitors with respect to the sale of our products, including brand owners, distributors that import products from abroad, and domestic retailers with established foreign manufacturing capabilities. Some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources and greater manufacturing capacity than we do. Our retail business competes against a diverse group of retailers, including, among others, other outlet stores, department stores, specialty stores, warehouse clubs and e-commerce retailers. Sales of our products are affected by style, price, quality, brand reputation and general fashion trends. 

Trademarks 

We own some of the trademarks used by us in connection with our wholesale operations segment, as well as almost all of the trademarks used in our retail operations segment. We act as licensee of certain trademarks owned by third parties that are used in connection with our wholesale operations segment. The principal brands that we license are summarized under the heading &#8220;Licensing&#8221; above. We own a number of proprietary brands that we use in connection with our business and products including, among others, Vilebrequin, Bass, G.H. Bass, Weejuns, Wilsons, Andrew Marc, Marc New York, Eliza J, Jessica Howard, Black Rivet and G-III Sports by Carl Banks. We have registered, or applied for registration of, many of our trademarks in multiple jurisdictions for use on a variety of apparel and related other products. 

In markets outside of the United States, our rights to some of our trademarks may not be clearly established. In the course of our attempt to expand into foreign markets, we may experience conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks that would impede our use and registration of some of our trademarks. Such conflicts may arise from time to time as we pursue international expansion. Although we have not in the past suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets or in new product categories, we cannot be sure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional brands to new markets. 

We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have value in the marketing of our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights against infringement. 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016, we had 7,693 employees, of whom 436 worked in executive or administrative capacities, 942 worked in design, merchandising and sourcing, 774 worked in warehouse and distribution facilities, 180 worked in wholesale sales, and 5,361 worked in our retail stores. Additionally, during our peak retail selling season from October through January, we employed approximately 2,451 additional seasonal associates in our retail stores. We employ both union and non-union personnel and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have not experienced any interruption of any of our operations due to a labor disagreement with our employees. 

We are a party to an agreement with one labor union. As of January 31, 2016, this agreement covers approximately 465 of our full-time employees, most of whom work in our warehouses located in New Jersey, and is currently in effect through November 15, 2017.
