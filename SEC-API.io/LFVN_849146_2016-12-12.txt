 ITEM 1 &#8212; BUSINESS 

Overview 

LifeVantage Corporation is a company focused on nutrigenomics, the study of how nutrition and naturally occurring compounds affect our genes. We are dedicated to helping people achieve their health, wellness and financial independence goals. We provide quality, scientifically-validated products and a financially rewarding direct sales business opportunity to preferred customers, retail customers and independent distributors who seek a healthy lifestyle and financial freedom. We sell our products in the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Canada, Philippines, Mexico, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. 

We engage in the identification, research, development and distribution of advanced nutraceutical dietary supplements and skin care products, including Protandim &#174; , our line of scientifically-validated dietary supplements, LifeVantage TrueScience &#174; , our line of anti-aging skin care products, Canine Health &#174; , our companion pet supplement formulated to combat oxidative stress in dogs, Axio &#174; , our energy drink mixes, and PhysIQ &#8482; , our smart weight management system. 

We were incorporated in Colorado in June 1988 under the name Andraplex Corporation. We changed our corporate name to Yaak River Resources, Inc. in January 1992, and subsequently changed it again in October 2004 to Lifeline Therapeutics, Inc. In October 2004 and March 2005, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Lifeline Nutraceuticals Corporation. In November 2006, we changed our name to LifeVantage Corporation. From our fiscal year 2005 until our fiscal year 2009, we marketed and sold a single product, Protandim &#174; , through traditional retail stores. In October 2008, we announced that we were transitioning our business model from a traditional retail model to a direct sales model in which Protandim &#174; &#32;would be sold primarily through our network of independent distributors. Since entering direct sales, we have increased our geographic reach by entering new international markets and increased our product offering by introducing additional scientifically-validated products. 

Fiscal Year 2016 Highlights 

International Expansion 

We expanded our international sales activities into the United Kingdom in March 2016 and the Netherlands in June 2016. 

New Science-Based Products 

We expanded our product offerings in fiscal year 2016 with three new products. In October 2015, we added Micro Lift Serum &#174; &#32;to our TrueScience &#174; &#32;Skin Care System, which was formulated as a natural way to visibly tighten, smooth and firm the skin around the eyes, quickly restoring a youthful looking radiance without sacrificing long-term skin health. In December 2015, we launched our PhysIQ&#8482; Smart Weight Management system, which includes four products to promote weight loss and support optimal digestion and immune function: PhysIQ&#8482; Cleanse, PhysIQ&#8482; Probio, PhysIQ&#8482; Fat Burn and PhysIQ&#8482; Protein. In May 2016, we expanded Protandim &#174; from a single product into a line of dietary supplements by introducing Protandim &#174; &#32;NRF1 Synergizer, which was formulated to strengthen the mitochondria, the powerhouse of all cells, for better cellular health. Protandim &#174; &#32;NRF1 Synergizer is designed to work in tandem with our flagship Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer. We currently have additional products in development. We intend to conduct additional research and development on these and other product candidates before introducing them through our network of independent distributors. We believe these new product lines show our commitment to delivering scientifically-backed products that help people feel, look and perform better. 

Executive Team 

We made significant changes to our executive management team during fiscal year 2016. In July 2015, we appointed Justin Rose as our Chief Sales Officer. Prior to joining LifeVantage, Mr. Rose spent 26 years in the direct selling industry in senior sales and marketing roles. In August 2015, we appointed Mark Jaggi as our Chief Financial Officer who, prior to joining LifeVantage, spent 20 years in lead financial, operational and strategic planning roles. In November 2015, we appointed Ryan Goodwin as our Chief Marketing Officer. Mr. Goodwin has more than a decade of experience building brands and marketing strategies for both direct sales companies and traditional consumer brands. 

Technology Innovation 

We introduced new mobile applications for our independent distributors to use to enhance their businesses. Our suite of four apps, available for both iPhone and Android, provide training and tools to help our independent distributors share our products and business opportunity. Our LV Pro App was designed for independent distributors access to their businesses in real-time, directly from their smart phones. Our LV Share App uses social media as an effective tool to connect and expand social 

- &#32;5 - 

reach on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram. Our Brandr App provides a library of professionally-designed overlays with our branding and other useful tools, including quotes, tips and facts independent distributors can share with their social networks. Lastly, our LV Move App is a platform designed to engage new distributors upon enrollment and mentor existing distributors to help them launch their respective businesses. 

Our Competitive Advantages 

We believe we have a competitive advantage in several key areas: 

&#8226; 

Our Compensation : We believe our compensation plan is one of the more financially rewarding in the direct selling industry. Our percentage of sales paid to independent distributors as compensation and incentive is one of the highest percentages reported in the direct selling industry. Our compensation plan also enables independent distributors to earn compensation early and often as they sell our products. Some elements of our compensation plan are paid weekly, allowing new independent distributors to receive compensation quickly. We believe more frequent payments of compensation helps us retain new independent distributors by allowing them to experience success soon after enrolling. We also offer a variety of incentive programs to our independent distributors for achieving specified sales goals. For example, our My LifeVenture &#174; &#32;is an incentive program that enables independent distributors to earn the title to a new Jeep Wrangler by achieving and maintaining specified sales goals. We believe our compensation plan and incentive programs help motivate our independent distributors to achieve success. 

&#8226; 

Our Products : We have a focus in nutrigenomics, the study of how nutrition and naturally occurring compounds affect our genes. We have developed quality, scientifically-validated nutrigenomics products focused on helping individuals look, feel and perform better. Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer is a patented dietary supplement clinically proven to combat oxidative stress, a natural consequence of cellular metabolism associated with many of the undesirable effects of aging. Protandim &#174; NRF1 Synergizer is a dietary supplement formulated to strengthen the mitochondria for better cellular health. Our skin care line, LifeVantage TrueScience &#174; , is a patented combination of scientifically based anti-aging skin care products formulated to target the visible signs of aging on the skin. Axio &#174; , our line of energy drink mixes, is formulated to promote alertness and support mental performance. PhysIQ&#8482;, our Smart Weight Management System, promotes weight loss and supports optimal digestion and immune function. Our companion pet supplement, Canine Health &#174; , incorporates some of the same active ingredients as Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer to combat oxidative stress in dogs. We believe our significant number of preferred customers who regularly purchase our products without the intention of becoming independent distributors is a strong indicator of the benefits of our products. 

&#8226; 

Distributor Training and Resources : We are committed to providing our independent distributors with resources and training designed to increase productivity and increase their potential for success. We provide training materials and we encourage our independent distributors to participate in company-sponsored events, including conventions, promotions and incentives. In addition, we are dedicated to using technology to facilitate a streamlined approach for independent distributors to manage their businesses and sell our products. Our suite of four new mobile applications provides the training and tools to help our independent distributors share our products and business opportunity directly from their smart phones. 

&#8226; 

Our Culture : We are committed to creating a culture for our independent distributors, customers and employees that focuses on ethical, legal and transparent business practices. At enrollment, our independent distributors agree to abide by our policies and procedures. Our policies and procedures, when followed, ensure that our independent distributors comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our compliance department monitors the activities of our independent distributors as part of our effort to enforce our policies and procedures. Similarly, our code of business conduct and ethics sets forth guidelines and expectations for our employees. We believe our ethical, legal and transparent culture attracts highly qualified employees and independent distributors who share our commitment to these principles. 

&#8226; 

Our Employees : We believe that our employees are an essential asset. We have a dedicated team of professionals that support our system of independent distributors, work to generate long-term value for our shareholders and contribute to the broader public through LifeVantage Legacy and other charitable programs. In turn, we offer competitive compensation, invest in our employees' careers and direct their focus on the long-term goals of our independent distributors and shareholders. 

Scientific Background 

Oxidative Stress 

Oxidative stress refers to the cellular and tissue damage caused by chemically reactive oxygen species that is generated as a natural result of cellular metabolism and the body's use of oxygen to generate energy. Levels of reactive oxygen species, also known as ROS, and free radicals can be elevated under a wide variety of conditions, including radiation, UV light, smoking, 

- &#32;6 - 

excessive alcohol consumption, as well as medical conditions involving inflammation, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes and advancing age. Elevated ROS levels inflict structural damage on nucleic acid, lipid, carbohydrate and protein components of cells, thereby directly contributing to or exacerbating tissue dysfunction, disease and age-related debilitation. 

Cellular antioxidant enzymes normally serve to inactivate ROS and maintain levels of ROS at those compatible with normal cell function. Important among these cellular antioxidant enzymes are superoxide dismutase and catalase. However, the levels of these protective antioxidant enzymes decrease with age and in a number of disease conditions. As we age and the levels of antioxidant enzymes decrease, oxidative stress levels increase significantly and our body is unable to maintain homeostasis relative to elevated ROS levels. 

Oxidative stress is widely believed to be a key factor in many of the undesirable effects of aging because it promotes cell death. Additionally, high levels of oxidative stress have also been linked as a causative or associated factor in over 100 diseases. 

Nrf2 Activation 

Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, also known as NFE2L2 or Nrf2, is a transcription factor that in humans is encoded by the NFE2L2 gene. Nrf2 is the master regulator of the antioxidant response, which is important for the amelioration of oxidative stress. Because Nrf2 is able to induce gene activity important in combating oxidative stress, thereby activating the body&#8217;s own protective response, it helps protect from a variety of complications related to oxidative stress. 

Under normal or unstressed conditions, Nrf2 resides in the cytoplasm of the cell, outside the nucleus, and is targeted for degradation. When activated, Nrf2 is able to move into the nucleus where it promotes the expression of several thousand genes, including those that encode antioxidant enzymes as well as anti-inflammatory and stress response proteins. 

In recent years, Nrf2 has become the subject of intense research. A common theme in much of this research is that activation of Nrf2 upregulates a coordinated antioxidant response and is therefore capable of protecting against oxidative stress-related injury and inflammatory disease in a wide variety of animal models. Therefore, Nrf2 represents an important therapeutic target. 

NRF1 Activation 

Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 or NRF1 is a transcription factor that contributes to the expression of many genes required for the maintenance and function of the mitochondria. Mitochondria are subcellular self-autonomous organelles and are primarily responsible for the generation of the chemical energy (ATP) that cells require to stay alive. Mitochondria constantly expand and divide based on the demand of the tissue cells in which they reside. They also play an important role in triggering the signaling cascade that results in the death of cells (apoptosis). Proper regulation of these mitochondrial functions is vitally important for the life and death of cells and for human health. 

Dysfunction of mitochondria has been associated with many chronic diseases in a wide variety of animal models. Therefore, the upregulation of NRF1 represents an important therapeutic target to support the proper function of mitochondria and human health. 

Research and Development 

Historically, we have focused our research and development efforts on creating and supporting scientifically-validated, yet highly demonstrative products under the Protandim &#174; , TrueScience &#174; , Canine Health &#174; , Axio &#174; , and PhysIQ &#8482; federation of brands. We anticipate that our future research and development efforts will be focused on creating, developing and evaluating new products that are consistent with our commitment to provide quality, scientifically-validated products. We intend to build on our foundation of combating oxidative stress and targeting specific benefit areas that help individuals feel, look and perform better. We also plan to continue sponsoring additional studies on our current products in an effort to further validate the benefits they provide. 

Product Overview 

Protandim &#174; Nrf2 Synergizer 

Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer is a patented dietary supplement that has been shown in a clinical trial to reduce the age-dependent increase in markers of oxidative stress, and has also been shown to provide substantial benefits to combat the variety of negative health effects linked to oxidative stress. 

Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer combats oxidative stress by increasing the body&#8217;s natural antioxidant protection at the genetic level. The unique blend of phytonutrients in Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer signals the activation of Nrf2 to increase production 

- &#32;7 - 

of antioxidant enzymes, specifically superoxide dismutase and catalase, and other cell-protective gene products. The body's internally produced antioxidant enzymes provide a better defense against oxidative stress than externally derived sources of antioxidants such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E and Coenzyme Q-10. Unlike externally derived sources of antioxidants, these enzymes are &#8220;catalytic,&#8221; which means these enzymes are not used up upon neutralizing free radicals. 

We hold multiple U.S. and international patents relating to Protandim &#174; Nrf2 Synergizer. We believe these patents set Protandim &#174; &#32;apart from other dietary supplements and protect the original formula as well as certain formula modifications we could create to extend our Protandim &#174; &#32;product line. We sell Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer in two formulas, one for our Japan market and one for all our other markets where registered. 

Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer has been, and is currently, the subject of numerous independent scientific studies at various universities and research facilities including Ohio State University, Louisiana State University, University of Colorado Denver, Virginia Commonwealth University, Colorado State University, Texas Tech University and the National Institute on Aging. The results of these studies have been published in a variety of peer-reviewed scientific journals, including Free Radical Biology &#38; Medicine, Enzyme Research, Circulation-the scientific journal of the American Heart Association, American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology, PLoS One, Journal of Dietary Supplements, Molecular Aspects of Medicine, Oxidative Medicine and Cell Longevity, Exercise &#38; Sports Science Reviews , Clinical Pharmacology, and The FASEB Journal. 

Protandim &#174; &#32;NRF1 Synergizer 

Protandim &#174; &#32;NRF1 Synergizer is a dietary supplement which was formulated to strengthen the mitochondria, the powerhouse of all cells, for better cellular health. It is designed to work in tandem with our flagship Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer and further enhance the body's internal ability to naturally produce antioxidants and reduce the effects of cellular stress. Protandim &#174; &#32;NRF1 Synergizer activates NRF1, a protein that regulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription, translation and repair. The unique blend of ingredients in Protandim &#174; &#32;NRF1 Synergizer supports the mitochondria to slow cellular aging and increase cellular energy.

Distribution of Products 

We believe our products are well suited for person-to-person sales through our direct selling model. This model allows our independent distributors to educate our customers regarding the benefits of our unique products more thoroughly than other business models. Our direct selling model also allows our independent distributors to offer personalized customer service to our customers and encourage regular use of our products. 

Product Return Policy 

All products purchased directly from us include a customer satisfaction guarantee. Subject to some exceptions based on local regulations, customers may return unopened product to us within 30 days of purchase for a refund of the purchase price less shipping and handling. In addition, our inventory repurchase program allows independent distributors who terminate their distributorship to return certain amounts of unopened, unexpired product purchased within the prior 12 months for a refund of the purchase price less a 10% restocking fee. The amount of inventory we will repurchase from an independent distributor is subject to specified consumption limitations. 

Customers 

We generally categorize our customers as independent distributors and preferred customers. 

Independent Distributors 

An independent distributor in our company is someone who participates in our direct sales business opportunity by purchasing our products at wholesale prices and selling our products to others interested in the products. We believe our independent distributors are typically entrepreneurs who believe in our products and desire to earn income by building a business of their own. Many of our independent distributors are attracted by the opportunity to sell unique, scientifically-validated products without incurring significant start-up costs. Independent distributors sign a contract with us that includes a requirement that they adhere to strict policies and procedures. Independent distributors purchase product from us for individual consumption, but also purchase small quantities of product from us to use for demonstrations and one-off, person-to-person retailing opportunities. They also spend a large amount of their time encouraging others to purchase our products, either for personal consumption or resale. 

While we provide support, product samples, brochures, magazines, and other sales and marketing materials, independent distributors are primarily responsible for attracting, enrolling and educating new independent distributors with respect to our products and compensation plan. An independent distributor creates multiple levels of compensation by selling our products and enrolling new independent distributors who sell our products. These newly enrolled independent distributors form a &#8220;downline&#8221; for the independent distributor who enrolled them. If downline independent distributors enroll new independent distributors who purchase our products, they create additional levels of compensation and their downline independent distributors remain in the same downline network as the original enrolling independent distributor. We pay commissions only upon the sale of our products. We do not pay commissions for enrolling independent distributors. 

We define &#8220;active independent distributors&#8221; as those independent distributors who have purchased product from us for retail or personal consumption during the prior three months. As of June 30, 2016 &#32;and June 30, 2015 , we had approximately 69,000 &#32;and 65,000 &#32;active independent distributors, respectively. 

- &#32;9 - 

Independent Distributor Compensation 

We believe our compensation plan is one of the more financially rewarding in the direct selling industry. Our percentage of sales paid to independent distributors as compensation and incentives is one of the highest percentages reported in the direct selling industry. Some elements of our compensation plan are paid weekly. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage and helps retain new distributors by allowing them to experience success quickly from their efforts. Our compensation plan is intended to appeal to a broad cross-section of people, particularly those seeking to supplement family income, start a home-based business or pursue entrepreneurial opportunities full- or part-time. Our independent distributors earn compensation on their product sales and product sales made by independent distributors within their sales organization, or "downline." Our independent distributors can also earn money by purchasing product from us at our wholesale cost and selling that product to others at the retail cost. We generally pay commissions in the local currency of the independent distributor&#8217;s home country. 

Independent Distributor Motivation and Training 

Our revenue depends in part on the success and productivity of our independent distributors. We provide tools, training and technology designed to increase our independent distributors' productivity and increase their potential for success. We offer training and business development opportunities to our independent distributors, including the following: 

&#8226; 

Blueprint : professionally-designed training materials independent distributors can utilize in their sales efforts; 

&#8226; 

Pro Audio Series : our weekly audio series presented by our independent distributor leaders providing training and tips on becoming more productive independent distributors; 

&#8226; 

Elite Academy and Global Convention : regularly occurring company-sponsored events intended to provide training and motivation to our independent distributors; and 

&#8226; 

Promotions and Incentive Trips : we hold special promotions and incentive trips from time to time in order to motivate our independent distributors to accomplish specific sales goals. 

We also introduced the following new mobile applications for our independent distributors to use to enhance their businesses: 

&#8226; 

LV Pro App : designed for independent distributors to access to their business in real-time, directly from their smart phone; 

&#8226; 

LV Share App : uses social media as an effective tool to connect and expand social reach on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Instagram; 

&#8226; 

Brandr App : library equipped with professionally-designed overlays with LifeVantage&#8217;s branding and other useful tools, including quotes, tips and facts independent distributors can share with their social networks; and 

&#8226; 

LV Move App : platform designed to engage new distributors upon enrollment and mentor existing distributors to help them launch their respective businesses. 

We are continuing to evaluate new ways in which to incorporate new technology and training opportunities to improve distributor success. 

Distributor Compliance Activities 

Given that our independent distributors are independent contractors, we do not control or direct their promotional efforts. We do, however, require that our independent distributors abide by policies and procedures that require them to act in an ethical manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As a member of the United States Direct Selling Association and similar organizations in many of the markets where we do business, we are also subject to the ethical business practices and consumer service standards required by the industry's code of ethics. 

Independent distributors must represent to us that their receipt of commissions is based on retail sales and substantial personal sales efforts. We must produce or pre-approve all sales aids used by distributors such as brochures and online materials. Products may be promoted only by personal contact or by collateral materials produced or approved by us. Independent distributors may not use our trademarks or other intellectual property without our consent. 

We monitor and systematically review alleged independent distributor misbehavior through our internal compliance department. If we determine one of our independent distributors has violated any of our policies and procedures, we may discipline the independent distributor and may terminate the independent distributor&#8217;s rights to distribute our products. When necessary, we have brought legal action against independent distributors, or former independent distributors, to enforce our 

- &#32;10 - 

policies and procedures. Short of termination or legal action, we may impose sanctions against independent distributors whose actions are in violation of our policies and procedures. Such sanctions may include warnings, probation, withdrawal or denial of an award, suspension of privileges of a distributorship, fines and/or withholding of commissions until specified conditions are satisfied, or other appropriate injunctive relief. 

Preferred Customers 

Preferred customers are customers who purchase products directly from us at our wholesale price on a monthly auto-ship basis for personal consumption, without the intent to resell or earn commissions from the sale of products. A preferred customer may enroll as an independent distributor at any time if he or she becomes interested in reselling the product. We believe our preferred customers are a great source of word-of-mouth advertising for our products. We also believe our large base of preferred customers validates the benefits of our products, separate from the direct selling business opportunity. 

We define an &#8220;active preferred customer&#8221; as a preferred customer who has purchased product from us within the prior three months. As of June 30, 2016 &#32;and June 30, 2015 , we had approximately 117,000 &#32;and 115,000 &#32;active preferred customers, respectively. 

Sales of Our Products 

We accept orders for our products through our own website at www.lifevantage.com and through personalized websites we provide to our independent distributors, which we refer to as &#8220;Virtual Offices&#8221;. Orders placed through Virtual Offices and through our website are processed daily at our fulfillment centers, where orders are shipped directly to the consumer. 

We offer toll-free numbers for our independent distributors and other customers to order product or ask questions. Our customer service representatives assist customers in placing orders through our web order processing system, answering questions, tracking packages, and initiating refunds. The customer service representatives receive extensive training about our products and our direct selling business model. Independent distributors and preferred customers generally pay for products by credit card, prior to shipment, and as a result, we carry minimal accounts receivable. 

Seasonality 

In addition to general economic factors, we are impacted by seasonal factors and trends such as major cultural events and vacation patterns. We believe that direct selling in Japan and the United States is also generally negatively impacted during our first fiscal quarter, from July 1 through September 30, when many individuals, including our independent distributors, traditionally take vacations. 

Although our product launch process may vary by market, we may introduce new products to our independent distributors and customers through limited-time offers and promotions. The limited-time offers and promotions typically generate significant activity and a high level of purchasing, which may result in a higher than normal increase in revenue during the quarter of the limited-time offer and skew year-over-year and sequential comparisons. 

Geographic Information 

We currently sell and distribute products in the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, Canada, Philippines, Mexico, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In fiscal year 2016 , revenue generated in the United States accounted for approximately 74% &#32;of our total revenue and revenue generated from Japan accounted for approximately 18% &#32;of our total revenue. For reporting purposes, we generally divide our markets into two geographic regions: the Americas region and the Asia/Pacific &#38; Europe region. The following table sets forth net revenue information by region for the periods indicated (in thousands):

Marketing 

We have a sales, marketing, public relations and customer service group consisting of 70 full-time employees as of June 30, 2016 . We utilize our network of independent distributors located throughout the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Philippines, Mexico, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to market and sell our products. 

Raw Materials and Manufacturing 

We outsource the primary manufacturing, fulfillment, and shipping components of our business to companies we believe possess a high degree of expertise. We believe outsourcing provides us access to advanced manufacturing process capabilities and expertise without incurring fixed costs associated with manufacturing our own products. 

We currently outsource the manufacturing of Protandim &#174; , Canine Health &#174; , Axio &#174; , LifeVantage TrueScience &#174; , and PhysIQ &#8482; products to multiple contract manufacturers. Our contract manufacturers of Protandim &#174; &#32;have a legal obligation to comply with the current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations that are applicable to those who manufacture, package, label and hold dietary supplements. Additionally, we are subject to regulations that, among other things, obligate us to know what and how manufacturing activities are performed so that we can make decisions related to whether the packaged and labeled product conforms to our established specifications and whether to approve and release product for distribution. We maintain and qualify alternative manufacturing options in order to keep our costs low, maintain the quality of our products, and be prepared for unanticipated spikes in demand or manufacturing failure. Our contract manufacturers deliver products to our fulfillment centers based on our purchase orders. 

We acquire raw materials for our products from third-party suppliers. Although we generally have good relationships with our suppliers, we believe we could replace any of our current suppliers without great difficulty or significant increase to our cost of goods sold. We also have ongoing relationships with secondary and tertiary suppliers. Please refer to " Risk Factors - High quality material for our products may be difficult to obtain or expensive " for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our sourcing of raw materials. 

Product Liability and Other Insurance 

We have product liability insurance coverage for our products that we believe is adequate for our needs. We also maintain commercial property and liability coverage and directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance. 

Intellectual Property 

We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect our intellectual property and license rights through patent protection, trade secrets and contractual protections, and intend to continue to develop a strong brand identity for our company and our products. 

Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer is a proprietary, patented dietary supplement formulation for enhancing antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase and catalase. The patents and patent applications protecting this formulation are held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lifeline Nutraceuticals Corporation. Our intellectual property is covered, in part, by seven issued U.S. and eight issued foreign patents. Our patents and patent applications claim the benefit of priority of multiple U.S. provisional patent applications, the earliest of which was filed on March 23, 2004, and relate to compositions, methods of use, and methods of manufacture of various compositions, including those embodied by the Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer formulation. The expected duration of our patent protection via granted patents for Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer is through approximately March 2025. In fiscal 2016, we received a composition patent for our LifeVantage TrueScience &#174; &#32;skin care products. This patent expires in approximately April 2034. 

We continue to protect our products and brands using trademarks. We have filed and successfully procured registered trademarks for Protandim &#174; , LifeVantage &#174; , TrueScience &#174; &#32;and Axio &#174; in many countries around the world, and we have pending trademark applications in many other countries. We anticipate seeking protection in other countries as we deem appropriate. 

In order to protect the confidentiality of our intellectual property, including trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary technical and business information, it is our policy to limit access to such information to those who require access in order to perform their functions and to enter into agreements with employees, consultants and vendors to contractually protect such information. 

Competition 

Direct Selling Companies 

We compete with other direct selling companies, many of which have longer operating histories and greater visibility, name recognition and financial resources than we do. We also compete with newer direct selling companies that attempt to 

- &#32;12 - 

solicit our independent distributors by offering the possibility of a more financially rewarding opportunity by being among the Company's early distributor base. We compete for new independent distributors with these companies on the basis of our business opportunity, product offerings, compensation plan, management and our operations. In order to successfully compete in the direct selling industry and attract and retain independent distributors, we must maintain the attractiveness of our business opportunity, product offerings and compensation plan. 

Dietary Supplement Market 

We compete with other companies that sell dietary supplements. We believe the dietary supplement market is a highly fragmented and competitive market. We believe competition in the dietary supplement market is based primarily on quality, price, efficacy of products, brand name and recognition of product benefits. In the dietary supplement industry, our competition includes numerous nutritional supplement companies, pharmaceutical companies and packaged food and beverage companies. Many of these companies have broader product lines, larger sales volumes and greater financial resources than we do. Additionally, some of these companies are able to compete more effectively due to greater vertical integration. Increased competition in the dietary supplement market could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Nrf2 Activators 

In the last few years we have seen the number of products marketed as Nrf2 activators increase, and we are currently aware of at least five such products. We anticipate the number of products that claim to activate Nrf2 will continue to increase as the technology becomes more popular and more broadly accepted. Although we are unaware of any competing direct selling company marketing products as Nrf2 activators, we are aware that at least two competing direct selling companies have sponsored research studies related to Nrf2 activation. 

Direct Antioxidants 

Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Coenzyme Q-10, and other sources of externally derived antioxidants may be considered competitors of Protandim &#174; &#32;but they are mechanistically distinct from Protandim &#174; . These other sources of antioxidants do not increase the body&#8217;s elimination of oxidants using internal antioxidant enzymes. Our research indicates that Protandim &#174; &#32;increases production of hundreds of stress-related anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic gene products including antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase and catalase, within the cells of the body. We believe that the body&#8217;s internally produced antioxidant enzymes provide a better defense against oxidative stress than externally derived sources of antioxidants. 

Oral Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase 

There are many companies performing research into antioxidants. Several companies sell oral forms of superoxide dismutase and catalase. Although we believe Protandim &#174; is a superior alternative to oral forms of superoxide dismutase and catalase, these products do compete with Protandim &#174; &#32;in the marketplace. We anticipate additional companies will likely develop, purchase or in-license products that are competitive with Protandim &#174; . 

Personal Skin Care Market 

In the personal skin care market, we compete principally with large, well-known cosmetics companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We believe, however, we can compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based skin care products. 

Animal Supplement Market 

We compete principally with large, well-known companies in the animal supplement market. Most of the companies we compete with in the animal supplement market have broad distribution channels that include retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We believe, however, we can compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based animal supplement product. 

Energy Drink Market 

We compete with large, well-known companies in the energy drink market. Most of the companies we compete with in the energy drink market have broad distribution channels that include big box retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We intend to compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based energy drink product. Axio is a no sugar, low-carbohydrate and low calorie energy drink that is also non-GMO, gluten-free and vegan. 

- &#32;13 - 

Weight Management Market 

We compete with large, well-known companies in the weight management market. Most of the companies we compete with in the weight management market have broad distribution channels that include big box retail establishments. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. We intend to compete with these larger companies by leveraging our direct selling model and emphasizing our unique, science-based weight management products. 

Regulatory Environment 

The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and advertising of our products in the United States are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, as well as comparable state laws. 

FDA Regulations and DSHEA 

We market our Protandim &#174; &#32;products as &#8220;dietary supplements&#8221; as defined in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA. DSHEA is intended to promote access to safe, quality dietary supplements, and information about dietary supplements. DSHEA established a new framework governing the composition and labeling of dietary supplements. DSHEA does not apply to animal supplements like Canine Health &#174; . We are not required to obtain FDA pre-market approval to sell our products in the United States under current laws. 

DSHEA permits statements of nutritional support, called &#8220;structure-function&#8221; statements, to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without FDA marketing approval. Such statements may claim a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease and disclose the prevalence of such disease in the United States, describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans, characterize the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function, or describe general well-being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient. Such statements may not expressly or impliedly claim that a dietary supplement is intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading and is supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. 

The FDA may assert that a particular statement of nutritional support that a company is using is an illegal claim; that assertion, normally, is in the form of a warning letter to that company. We have a duty to send to the FDA a notice that lists each new structure-function statement made by us; we are obligated to send that notice within 30 days after the first marketing of a supplement with such a statement. 

DSHEA also permits certain scientific literature, for example a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication, to be used in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. However, such literature must not be false or misleading, the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement and it must include a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter, among other requirements. 

The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, or CVM, is responsible for enforcing the portion of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the Act, that relates to animal supplements, like our Canine Health &#174; &#32;product. CVM's primary responsibility in enforcing the Act is to ensure that animal supplements are safe, effective, and can be manufactured to a consistent standard. 

While we exercise care in our formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and advertising of our products, we cannot guarantee the FDA will never inform us that the FDA believes some violation of law has occurred either by us or by our independent distributors. Any allegations of our non-compliance may result in time-consuming and expensive defense of our activities. The FDA&#8217;s normal course of action is to issue a warning letter if it believes that a product is misbranded or adulterated. The responsive action requested by the FDA differs depending upon the nature of the product and claims in question. Typically, the FDA expects a written response within 15 working days of the receipt of a warning letter. The warning letter is public information posted on the FDA&#8217;s web site. That information could affect our relationships with our investors, independent distributors, vendors, and consumers. Warning letters also often spark private class action litigation under state consumer protection statutes. The FDA could also order compliance activities, such as an inspection of our facilities and products, and could file a civil lawsuit in which an arrest warrant (seizure) could be issued as to some or all of our products. In extraordinary cases, we could be named a defendant and sued for declaratory and injunctive relief. 

FTC Regulations 

Advertising and marketing of our products in the United States are also subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act. Among other things, the FTC Act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair false 

- &#32;14 - 

or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The FTC Act also makes it illegal to disseminate or cause to be disseminated any false advertisement. The FTC Act provides that disseminating any false advertisement pertaining to foods, which would include dietary supplements, is an unfair or deceptive act or practice. An advertiser is required to have competent and reliable scientific evidence for all express and implied health-related product claims at the time the claims are first made. We are required to have adequate scientific substantiation for all material advertising claims made for our products in the United States. The FTC routinely reviews websites to identify questionable advertising claims and practices. Competitors sometimes inform the FTC when they believe other competitors are violating the FTC Act and consumers also notify the FTC of what they believe may be wrongful advertising. The FTC may initiate a non-public investigation that focuses on our advertising claims which usually involves non-public pre-lawsuit extensive formal discovery. Such an investigation may be very expensive to defend, be lengthy, and result in a publicly disclosed Consent Decree, which is a settlement agreement. If no settlement can be reached, the FTC may start an administrative proceeding or a federal court lawsuit against us or our principal officers. The FTC often seeks to recover from the defendants, whether in a Consent Decree or a proceeding, any or all of the following: (i) consumer redress in the form of monetary relief or disgorgement of profits; (ii) significant reporting requirements for several years; and (iii) injunctive relief. In addition, most, if not all, states have statutes prohibiting deceptive and unfair acts and practices. The requirements under these state statutes are similar to those of the FTC Act. 

The National Advertising Division, or NAD, of the national Better Business Bureau, a non-governmental not-for-profit organization through its Advertising Self-Regulatory Council, or ASRC, is also actively engaged in conducting investigations, called inquiries, which are focused on determining whether the requisite claim substantiation standard exists for specific structure-function claims. Although the results of each inquiry or proceeding are not binding on the recipient, they are posted on NAD&#8217;s website, and the NAD often refers cases to the FTC if the advertisers do not agree to modify their advertising in conformance with the NAD decision. We have been the subject of a NAD proceeding in 2008 and 2009, which was concluded in 2009. 

Regulation of Direct Selling Activities 

Direct selling activities are regulated by the FTC, as well as various federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States and foreign countries. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often referred to as &#8220;pyramid&#8221; schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales. The laws and regulations often: 

&#8226; 

require us or our distributors to register with governmental agencies; 

&#8226; 

impose caps on the amount of commission we can pay; 

&#8226; 

impose reporting requirements; and 

&#8226; 

require that we ensure, among other things, that our distributors maintain levels of product sales to qualify to receive commissions and that our distributors are being compensated primarily for sales of products and not primarily for recruiting additional participants. 

The laws and regulations governing direct selling are modified from time to time, and, like other direct selling companies, we may be subject from time to time to government investigations related to our direct selling activities. This may require us to make changes to our business model and our compensation plan. 

State Regulations 

In addition to United States federal regulation, each state has enacted its own food and drug laws. We may receive requests to supply information regarding our sales or advertising to state regulatory agencies. We remain subject to the risk that, in one or more of our present or future markets, our products, sales, and advertising could be found non-compliant with state laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business in a particular market or in general. In addition, these laws and regulations could affect our ability to enter new markets. 

The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act 

The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, was enacted in 2011 and is now part of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. The FSMA is a comprehensive set of laws that gives the FDA considerable authority with respect to the prevention of food contamination and the serious problems associated with such contamination. Among other things, it does the following: 

&#8226; 

gives the FDA explicit authority to inspect and copy certain records related to any food and to compel a recall if the FDA believes there is a reasonable probability of serious adverse health consequences or death; 

- &#32;15 - 

&#8226; 

places strict obligations on food and dietary supplement importers to verify that food from foreign suppliers is not adulterated or misbranded; and 

&#8226; 

provides whistle blower protection for employees of conventional food or dietary supplement companies who provide information to governmental authorities about violations of the FFDCA. 

International Regulations 

In addition to the regulations applicable to our activities in the United States, all other markets in which we operate our business regulate our products under a variety of statutory and regulatory schemes. We typically market our Protandim &#174; &#32;line of products in international markets as foods, health foods or dietary supplements under applicable regulatory regimes. However, because of varied regulations, some products or ingredients that are recognized as a &#8220;food&#8221; in certain markets may be treated as a &#8220;pharmaceutical&#8221; or equivalent in other markets. In the event a product, or an ingredient in a product, is classified as a drug or pharmaceutical product in any market, we will generally not be able to distribute that product through our distribution channel because of pre-marketing approval requirements and strict regulations applicable to drug and pharmaceutical products. In Japan, for example, ashwagandha was determined to be inappropriate for inclusion in food products. Ashwagandha is one of the ingredients in Protandim &#174; Nrf2 Synergizer. While we disagree with the assessment of ashwagandha by Japanese regulatory authorities, we are restricted from selling a formulation of Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer that contains ashwagandha in Japan. As such, we reformulated Protandim &#174; Nrf2 Synergizer for the Japan market to exclude ashwagandha. This reformulated Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer was introduced in Japan in fiscal 2013. 

Similarly, our other markets outside the United States regulate advertising and product claims regarding the efficacy of our products and require adequate substantiation of claims. As such, we are unable to claim that any of our products will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent diseases. For example, in Japan, Protandim &#174; &#32;Nrf2 Synergizer is considered a food product, which significantly limits our ability to make claims regarding the product. If marketing materials make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for dietary supplements, regulatory authorities could deem our products to be unapproved drugs and we could experience substantial harm. 

Our business model is also subject to regulatory frameworks that may limit or significantly alter the way business is done in foreign markets vis-&#224;-vis the United States. For example, our marketing of products or business opportunity as a distributor in the United Kingdom differs significantly from marketing to United States customers and distributors. Consequently, we may experience additional costs and delays in entering or continuing to do business in foreign markets in order to comply with local regulations. 

Potential FDA and Other Regulation 

We could become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA, FTC, or other federal, state, local or international regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we consider favorable, such as DSHEA, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. Because of negative publicity associated with some adulterated or misbranded supplements, including pharmaceutical drugs marketed as dietary supplements, there has been an increased movement in the United States and other markets to expand the regulation of dietary supplements, which could impose additional restrictions or requirements in the future. In general, the regulatory environment is becoming more complex with increasingly strict regulations. 

The Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act requires us to report to the FDA all serious adverse events and to maintain for six years records of all adverse events, whether or not serious. An adverse event is defined as any health-related event associated with the use of a dietary supplement that is adverse. In addition, this law requires the label of each dietary supplement, including our Protandim &#174; &#32;products, to include a domestic address or telephone number by which the company selling the product may receive a report of a serious adverse event associated with such product. The labels of our Protandim &#174; &#32;products comply with that statutory provision. 

Legislation known as the Dietary Supplement Labeling Act was introduced in the United States in 2013. This proposed legislation purports to help consumers distinguish between dietary supplements that are safe and those that have potentially serious side-effects or drug interactions. The Dietary Supplement Labeling Act would require dietary supplement manufacturers to disclose known ingredient risks and display mandatory warnings if a product contains an ingredient that could cause potentially serious adverse events. Although it is not currently known if, or in what form, the Dietary Supplement Labeling Act will be enacted, it could create additional regulatory burdens on our business and increase our cost of goods sold. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016 &#32;and June 30, 2015 , we had 208 and 166 full time employees, respectively. As of June 30, 2016 , 160 of our full time employees were based in the United States, 36 were based in Japan, nine were based in Thailand and three were 

- &#32;16 - 

based in Hong Kong. We do not include our independent distributors in our number of employees because our independent distributors are independent contractors and not employees. We outsource our manufacturing and distribution operations.
