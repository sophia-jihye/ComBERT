 Item 1. Business. 

Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to &#8220;Four Corners,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; include Four Corners Property Trust, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. 

General Development of Business 

We were incorporated as a Maryland corporation on July 2, 2015 as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Darden Restaurants, Inc., (together with its consolidated subsidiaries &#8220;Darden&#8221;), for the purpose of owning, acquiring and leasing properties on a triple-net basis, primarily for use in the restaurant industry. On November 9, 2015, Darden completed a spin-off of Four Corners whereby Darden contributed to us 100% of the equity interest in entities that own 418 properties (the &#8220;Properties&#8221; or &#8220;Property&#8221;) in which Darden operates restaurants, representing five of their brands, and six LongHorn Steakhouse&#174; restaurants located in the San Antonio, Texas area (the &#8220;Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business&#8221;) along with the underlying properties or interests therein associated with the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. In exchange, we issued to Darden all of our common stock and paid a $315.0 million cash dividend to Darden. Subsequently, Darden distributed all of our outstanding shares of common stock pro rata to holders of Darden common stock whereby each Darden shareholder received one share of our common stock for every three shares of Darden common stock held at the close of business on the record date, which was November 2, 2015, as well as cash in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock which they would have otherwise received (the &#8220;Spin-Off&#8221;). The Spin-Off is intended to qualify as tax-free to Darden shareholders for U. S. federal income tax purposes, except for cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. We intend to qualify as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT,&#8221;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the taxable year beginning January 1, 2016. 

Following completion of the Spin-Off, we became an independent, publicly traded, self-administered company, primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition and leasing of restaurant properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Four Corners Operating Partnership, LP (&#8220;Four Corners OP&#8221;), a Delaware limited partnership of which we are the initial limited partner and our wholly owned subsidiary, Four Corners GP, LLC (&#8220;Four Corners GP&#8221;), is its sole general partner and our wholly owned subsidiary. 

Our shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;FCPT&#8221;. 

Our executive offices are located at 501 Redwood Highway, Suite 1150, Mill Valley, California 94941, and our telephone number is (415) 965-8030. 

At March 16, 2016 we employed 334 individuals. 

Overview of our Business 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 424 properties, all within the continental United States. Our revenues from our leasing operations segment are primarily generated by leasing the Properties to Darden and additional properties to other tenants through triple-net lease arrangements (the &#8220;Leases&#8221; or &#8220;Lease&#8221;) under which Darden is primarily responsible for ongoing costs relating to the Properties, including utilities, property taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges, and maintenance and repair costs. For more information about our two segments, see &#8220;Segments&#8221; below. 

We also generate revenues by operating the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business through our restaurants operations segment pursuant to franchise agreements with Darden (the &#8220;Franchise Agreements&#8221;). Of the six LongHorn SteakHouse &#174; &#32;restaurant properties located in the San Antonio area, three are properties that we lease to our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, Kerrow Holdings, LLC (together with its subsidiaries &#8220;Kerrow&#8221;), and three are owned by Kerrow, subject to ground leases. Kerrow is our taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;). During 2015, we operated our business in two segments: real estate operations and restaurant operations. 

In addition to managing our existing properties, our strategy includes investing in additional restaurant and food service real estate properties to grow and diversify our existing restaurant portfolio. We intend to purchase properties that are well located, occupied by durable restaurant concepts, with creditworthy tenants whose operating cash flow are expected to meaningfully exceed their lease payments to us. We seek to improve the probability of successful tenant renewal at the end of initial lease terms by acquiring demographically favored properties that have high levels of restaurant operator profitability compared to rent payments and have absolute rent levels that are consistent with, or below, market rates. 

Segments 

W e operate in two segments, real estate operations and restaurant operations. Our segments are based on our organizational and management structure, which aligns with how our results are monitored and performance is assessed. 

Our real estate operations segment consists of rental revenues primarily generated by leasing restaurant properties to tenants through triple-net lease arrangements under which the tenant is primarily responsible for ongoing costs relating to the properties. It also includes expenses associated with continuing efforts to invest in additional restaurant and food service real estate properties and our corporate operating expenses. Our real estate operations are funded by a $750 million credit agreement consisting of a 5-year term loan facility of $400 million and a currently undrawn 4-year revolving credit facility of $350 million. Interest expense associated with this agreement is included in real estate operations. 

Our restaurant operations segment is conducted through our TRS and consists of our Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. The associated sales revenues, restaurant expenses and overhead, and depreciation on the six buildings and equipment are components of restaurant operations. 

Competitive Advantage 

We believe that we have significant competitive advantages that support our core business of owning and leasing restaurant and retail properties as further outlined below. 

Leading Nationwide REIT Focused on Restaurant Properties 

We are focused on the ownership of properties used in the restaurant industry and have tailored our business strategy to address the needs of restaurant operators. We believe our scale, national reach, restaurant operations experience, and efficient lease structuring will help us achieve operational efficiencies and support future growth opportunities. In contrast to the majority of existing net-lease REITs that are diversified by retail industry and property type, we believe that our focus and expertise in the restaurant space will generate data and understanding to better support effective investment and leasing decisions. 

Large Addressable Market Potential in US Food Service Industry 

As a whole, the restaurant industry has been able to achieve healthy same-restaurant and restaurant-count growth recently. According to Nation&#8217;s Restaurant News 2015 Top 100, the top 100 restaurant chains (the &#8220;Top 100&#8221;) achieved aggregate sales of more than $230 billion in 2014, an increase of 4.6% over 2013. While improving same-restaurant sales support the credit worthiness 

of restaurant companies and stand-alone restaurants, we believe the net additions of nearly 4,000 restaurants by the top 100 restaurant chains, an increase in the restaurant count of 2.1%, has driven the demand for external investment in restaurant real estate. By virtue of its large scale, we believe that the U.S. restaurant industry offers a sizable pool of attractive property acquisition targets across different types of restaurant properties, including quick service, take-out, casual dining, fast casual, and fine dining, to enable diversified growth for us. Furthermore, continuing strong unit growth trends could create opportunities for us to partner with both restaurant companies and franchisees. 

According to Nation&#8217;s Restaurant News 2015 Top 100, franchisees operate over 80% of the Top 100&#8217;s new restaurants opened in 2014 and over 75% of the Top 100&#8217;s aggregate units, representing more than 144,000 restaurants and growing as restaurant companies migrate increasingly to an &#8220;asset light&#8221; strategy. As restaurant companies implement &#8220;asset light&#8221; strategies, external capital is required by franchisees and landlords to finance individual restaurant operations and real estate, respectively. Franchisees, which often lease the restaurants that they operate, are potential future partners for us. 

Furthermore, implementation of &#8220;asset light&#8221; strategies by restaurant companies may provide landlords like us an opportunity to enter into sale-leaseback transactions with the parent company of corporate-operated restaurants for their existing properties and to finance future restaurant development by these restaurant companies. 

We also believe there may be other attractive opportunities for growth outside the traditional restaurant sector. This may include one or more of the following: food service distribution facilities, and cold storage facilities. 

Uniquely Positioned to Capitalize on Expansion Opportunities 

We believe there is a large market opportunity to acquire additional restaurant properties and that a number of restaurant operators would like the opportunity to monetize their real estate holdings while continuing to operate their existing core businesses. We believe that a number of restaurant operators would be willing to enter into transactions designed to monetize their real estate assets through sale-leaseback transactions with an unrelated party not perceived to be a competitor, such as us. These restaurant operators could use the proceeds from the sale of their real estate assets for several different business purposes, including (i) reducing bank loans and lines of credit, (ii) reinvestment in existing operations, or (iii) for new business initiatives including opening new locations or pursuing acquisitions. Sale-leaseback transactions can provide an attractive means for both mature operators as well as fast-growing businesses to repatriate capital into more attractive opportunities. We may also provide such restaurant and retail operators with expansion opportunities that they may not otherwise be in a position to pursue by providing them with capital to expand and enhance their operations at rates that provide both an attractive risk-adjusted return to us and are more attractive to the restaurant or retail operators than they may be able to receive through traditional debt financing arrangements. 

Geographically Diverse Asset Portfolio 

The Properties are located in 44 different states across the continental United States. The Properties in any one state do not account for more than 11% of the Properties and no more than 14% of our total rental revenue. We believe this geographic diversification will limit the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance. 

Diversity in Tenant Product Offerings 

Darden, currently the sole lessee of the Properties, operates multiple restaurant concepts, offering various types of cuisines at multiple price-points. The following table shows the approximate average cost per person of a meal at each of the five Darden brands that are represented among the Properties we lease to Darden.

As the Properties we lease to Darden include restaurants from five of Darden&#8217;s nationally-recognized brands, we believe that we benefit from Darden&#8217;s diverse product offerings. 

Financially Secure Tenant 

Darden is our only tenant. Darden owns and operates seven nationally recognized brands, including the five brands that are represented among the Properties we lease to Darden: Olive Garden&#174;, LongHorn Steakhouse&#174;, Bahama Breeze&#174;, Seasons 52&#174; and Wildfish Seafood Grille&#174;. Darden continues to operate its nationally recognized portfolio of restaurant brands both on the Properties leased from us under the Leases and on other properties. For the year ended November 29, 2015, Darden reported revenue of approximately $6.8 billion and net cash from operations of $867.0 million. Darden&#8217;s liquidity position, leverage position and ability to generate significant free cash flow should provide it with the ability to pay the annual lease obligations to us for the foreseeable future. Darden is publicly traded and is subject to SEC reporting requirements, which provide ongoing transparency regarding its operating and financial performance. For further information, refer to the investor relations section of www.darden.com . We do not intend for Darden&#8217;s website to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the information contained on its website into this report or other filings with the SEC. 

Long-Term, Triple-Net Lease Structure 

The Properties are leased to Darden on a triple-net lease basis with an average initial term of approximately fifteen years, thereby providing a long-term, stable income stream. Under the Leases, the tenant is responsible for maintaining the Properties in accordance with prudent industry practice and in compliance with all federal and state standards. The maintenance responsibilities include, among others, maintaining the building, building systems and improvements. In addition to maintenance requirements, the tenant is also responsible for insurance required to be carried under the Leases, taxes levied on or with respect to the Properties, payment of common area maintenance charges and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the Properties and the business conducted on the Properties. At the option of the tenant, the Leases will generally allow extensions for a certain number of five-year renewal terms beyond the initial term and the tenant can elect which of the Properties then subject to the Leases to renew. The number and duration of the renewal terms for any given Property may vary, however, based on the initial term of the relevant Lease and other factors. 

Our Business Objectives and Strategy 

Our primary goal is to create long-term stockholder value by executing our investment objectives to maximize the value of our assets, to acquire assets at attractive investment returns including growth opportunities due to favorable lease structures and attractive submarket demographics, and to provide attractive and growing quarterly cash dividends. To achieve this goal, we intend to own the properties and collect rents under the Leases, as well as pursue a business strategy focused on opportunistic acquisitions and asset and tenant diversification. We do not currently have a fixed target of the number of acquisitions we intend to make over a particular time period, but rather, we intend to pursue those acquisitions that meet our investing and financing objectives where we can earn a return above our weighted-average cost of capital adjusted to reflect counterparty risk. 

The key components of our business strategy, beyond servicing our Leases with Darden, include: 

&#8226; 

Acquire Additional Restaurant Properties: Initially, we expect to focus on growing and diversifying our property portfolio by acquiring restaurant properties. These transactions may take many forms including triple-net sale-leaseback transactions with restaurant operators, acquisitions in the 1031 exchange market or acquisitions of portfolios of properties from other REITs and other public and private real estate owners. We will employ a disciplined, opportunistic acquisition strategy and price transactions appropriately based on, among other things, the mix of assets acquired, length and terms of the lease, location and submarket attractiveness, building quality and estimated remaining useful life, and the credit worthiness of the initial tenant. 

&#8226; 

Fund Strategic Capital Improvements for Existing and Future Tenants: Currently, Darden constitutes our entire tenant base. We will consider supporting the growth initiatives of Darden, and any future tenant operators, by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including capacity augmentation projects. If completed, we expect to structure these investments under terms that we deem to be economically attractive to our stockholders, either as lease amendments that produce additional rents or as loans that are repaid by operators during the applicable lease term. 

&#8226; 

Re-leasing Properties: Over time we will face a re-tenanting risk and opportunity. If Darden or other future tenants elect to cease operations at any of our properties, we will be faced with finding a replacement tenant at the end of the lease term. We plan to use leasing expertise and relationships developed through our national operations to replace tenants under any expiring leases. 

&#8226; 

Develop New Tenant Relationships: Our focus in the restaurant and related food service industry should allow us to cultivate new relationships with potential tenants and restaurant operators in order to expand the mix of tenants operating our properties and, in doing so, reduce our concentration with Darden. 

&#8226; 

Maintain Balance Sheet Strength and Liquidity: We intend to maintain a capital structure that provides the resources and financial flexibility to support the growth of our business. Our principal sources of liquidity will be our cash generated through our operations as well as our revolving credit facility that is undrawn as of March 18, 2016. Through disciplined capital spending and working capital management, we intend to maximize our cash flows and maintain our targeted balance sheet and leverage ratios. 

&#8226; 

Operate the Kerrow Operating Business : We operate the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business through Kerrow. Although we intend to derive the majority of our revenue from leasing properties on a triple-net basis to restaurant and retail operators, the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business will provide us with the expertise to better analyze other restaurant properties that could serve as expansion opportunities 

Investment and Financing Policies 

Our investment objectives are to increase cash flow, provide quarterly cash dividends which grow annually, maximize the value of our assets and acquire assets with cash flow growth potential. Initially, we intend to invest primarily in restaurant properties. Over time, we believe we have the potential to diversify into other food service and related property types beyond the restaurant industry. 

We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of currently owned or newly-acquired restaurant properties, will be financed, in whole or in part, with cash flow from our operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, or the proceeds from issuances of common stock, preferred stock, debt or other securities. Our investment and financing policies and objectives are subject to change periodically at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of stockholders. 

Flexible UPREIT Structure 

We operate in what is commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which substantially all of our properties and assets are held through Four Corners OP. Four Corners OP is managed by Four Corners GP, which accordingly controls the management and decisions of Four Corners OP. Conducting business through Four Corners OP allows us flexibility in the manner in which we structure and acquire properties. In particular, an UPREIT structure enables us to acquire additional properties from sellers in exchange for limited partnership units in Four Corners OP. As a result, this structure potentially may facilitate our acquisition of assets in a more efficient manner and may allow us to acquire assets that the owner would otherwise be unwilling to sell to us. 

Our Portfolio 

At December 31, 2015, we owned 424 properties, all within the continental United States. Of these properties, 418 were held for investment and leased to Darden under triple-net leases. These 418 properties had an aggregate leasable area of approximately 3,287,000 square feet, were located in 44 states, and had a weighted average remaining non-cancelable lease term of 14.5 years before any lease renewals. The remaining six properties are operated by the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business as LongHorn Steakhouses subject to franchise agreements with Darden. Three of these restaurants are subject to ground leases. See &#8220;Item 2. Properties&#8221; for additional information about properties and tenants. 

The Properties represent five of the Restaurant brands Darden operates. The following table summarizes the Leased Properties by brand as of December 31, 2015.

Leases with Darden 

The initial estimated annual cash rent under the Leases is approximately $94.4 million during the first year of the Leases. Commencing with the second year of the Leases and continuing for the initial term, under the Leases, the rent is subject to annual escalation of 1.5%, as well as, in most of the leases, a fair market value adjustment at the start of one of the renewal options. Darden also entered into guaranties, pursuant to which it guarantied the obligations of the tenants under substantially all of the Leases entered into in respect of the Properties. The Properties are leased to one or more of Darden&#8217;s operating subsidiaries pursuant to the Leases, which are triple-net leases. The Leases provide for an average initial term of approximately fifteen years, with no purchase options provided that Darden will have a right of first offer with respect to our sale of any Property, if there is no default under the Lease, and we will be prohibited from selling any Properties to (i) any nationally recognized casual or fine dining brand restaurant or entity operating the same or (ii) any other regionally recognized casual or fine dining brand restaurant or entity operating the same, with 25 or more units. At the option of the tenant, the Leases will generally allow extensions for a certain number of renewal terms of five years each beyond the initial term and the tenant can elect which of the Properties then subject to the Leases to renew. The number and duration of the renewal terms for any given Property may vary, however, based on the initial term of the relevant Lease and other factors. 

Because we lease the Properties to one or more of Darden&#8217;s operating subsidiaries under the Leases, Darden is currently the source of a substantial majority of our revenues, and Darden&#8217;s financial condition and ability and willingness to satisfy its obligations under the Leases and its willingness to renew the Leases upon expiration of the initial base term thereof significantly impacts our revenues and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that Darden will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Leases, and any inability or unwillingness on its part to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, on our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and on our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, as required for us to qualify, and maintain our status, as a REIT. We also cannot assure you that the tenant will elect to renew the lease arrangements with us upon expiration of the initial base terms or any renewal terms thereof or, if such leases are not renewed, that we can re-lease the affected properties on the same or better terms. See &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-We are dependent on Darden to make payments to us under the Leases as well as to provide services to us under the Transition Services Agreement and the Franchise Agreements and an event that materially and adversely affects Darden&#8217;s business, financial position or results of operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.&#8221; 

The following table provides a summary of some of the notable terms of the Leases: 

Number of Leases: 

Average Remaining Term: 

Approximately 14.5 years 

Duration of Darden Renewal Option: 

Typically five years; however, the number and duration of renewal options may vary by property based on the initial term of the relevant Lease and other factors 

Average Initial Annual Cash Rent Amount: 

$226,000 

Annual Rent Escalation: 

1.5% during the initial term 

Guaranties: 

Darden Restaurants, Inc. has entered into guaranties, pursuant to which it will guaranty the obligations of the tenants under substantially all of the Leases entered into by its subsidiaries with Four Corners Properties 

The above table is not intended to be a complete summary of the terms of the Leases and is not a substitute for carefully reviewing the Form of Lease, which was filed as an exhibit to our registration statement on Form 10 filed with the SEC on October 5, 2015. 

Franchise Agreements 

Pursuant to the Franchise Agreements, Darden grants the right and license to our subsidiary, Kerrow, to operate the Longhorn Steakhouse restaurants of the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. The Franchise Agreements include, among other things, a license to display trademarks, utilize trade secrets and purchase proprietary products from Darden. Other services to be included pursuant to the Franchise Agreements are marketing services, training and access to certain LongHorn &#174; &#32;operating procedures. The Franchise Agreements also contain provisions under which Darden may provide certain technical support for the Kerrow Restaurant Operating Business. The fees and conditions of these franchising services are on terms comparable to similar franchising services negotiated on an arm&#8217;s length basis and consistent with industry standard provisions. 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, restaurant and retail operators, lenders and other investors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources and lower costs of capital. These institutions may accept greater risk or lower returns, allowing them to offer more attractive terms to prospective tenants or for the acquisition of restaurant properties. Our restaurant operations also face active competition with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel. 

Governmental Regulations Affecting Properties 

Property Environmental Considerations 

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Although we do not operate or manage most of our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of any of our current or former properties at or from which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous material, as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the contamination. 

In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property&#8217;s value, we or our tenants could be subject to other liabilities, including governmental penalties for violation of environmental, health and safety laws, liabilities for injuries to persons for exposure to hazardous materials, and damages to property or natural resources. Furthermore, some environmental laws can create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination or can restrict the manner in which a property may be used because of contamination. We also could be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at third party sites, e.g., landfills, where we send waste for disposal without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. 

Although the Leases require Darden to indemnify us for environmental liabilities, and although we intend to require our other operators and tenants to undertake to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities, including environmental liabilities they cause, the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of Darden, or such other tenant or operator to indemnify us. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell, develop or lease the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. 

As of March 18, 2016, we have not been notified by any governmental authority of, nor is management aware of, any non-compliance or liability with respect to environmental laws that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. 

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 

The properties, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws and regulations (collectively the &#8220;ADA&#8221;). Investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with the ADA. The tenant has the primary responsibility for complying with the ADA, but we may incur costs if the tenant does not comply. As of March 18, 2016, we have not been notified by any governmental authority of, nor is management aware of, any non-compliance with the ADA that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. 

Other Regulations 

State and local fire, life-safety and similar entities regulate the use of the properties. The tenant has the primary responsibility for complying with regulations but failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions to conduct business on such properties. 

Insurance 

We require that our tenants maintain all customary lines of insurance on our properties and their operations, including comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance. The tenants under the Leases may have the ability to self-insure or use a captive provider with respect to its insurance obligations. We believe that the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, we cannot make any assurances that Darden or any other tenants in the future will maintain the required insurance coverages, and the failure by any of them to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Emerging Growth Company 

We currently qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;). Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition 

period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of such extended transition period, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

For as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may also take advantage of certain limited exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for up to five years; 

&#8226; 

reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 

&#8226; 

exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

We have elected not to take advantage of any of the reduced disclosure obligations afforded to emerging growth companies by the JOBS Act, other than the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We expect to remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we are deemed to be a &#8220;large accelerated filer,&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act or any successor statute, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period, and (4) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act.
