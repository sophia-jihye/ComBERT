 Item 1. BUSINESS Overview 

We are one of the largest specialty molecular diagnostic laboratories in the world and since our founding in 1992, have tested over 2.0 million patients. We are headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah and generated worldwide revenues of approximately $754 million during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We are a leading personalized medicine company dedicated to being a trusted advisor transforming patient lives through pioneering molecular diagnostics. Through our proprietary technologies, we believe we are positioned to identify important disease genes, the proteins they produce, and the biological pathways in which they are involved to better understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins may play in the disease process. We believe that identifying biomarkers (DNA, RNA and proteins) will enable us to develop novel molecular diagnostic tests that can provide important information to solve unmet medical needs. 

Our Mission 

Our goal is to provide physicians with critical information to guide the healthcare management of their patients by addressing four major questions a patient may have about their healthcare: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; What is the likelihood of my getting a disease? 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Do I have a disease? 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; How aggressively should my disease be treated? 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Which therapy will work best to treat my disease? 

Over time, we have developed and plan to develop additional products that answer these important questions in six medical specialties: oncology, preventive care, urology, dermatology, autoimmune and neuroscience. We believe that these product channels represent markets where there is a significant opportunity for high-value molecular diagnostic tests to positively impact patient care and drive value for the healthcare system. 

Our Business Strategy 

Our strategy is focused on executing the following three strategic imperatives: 

&#160;

&#160; 1. Transition and expand the hereditary cancer market &#151;In fiscal year 2016, approximately 84 percent of our revenue was derived from the sale of products to assess a patient&#146;s risk for hereditary cancer. Given that this is our most important market and that we are the worldwide leader in hereditary cancer testing, we are focused on transitioning this market from single-syndrome testing to a more sensitive panel approach. Additionally, we are continuing to expand market penetration as well as grow the number of patients eligible for testing. In the United States, we are currently conducting multiple clinical studies focused on expanding the addressable patient populations who qualify for hereditary cancer testing. Upon completion of these studies, we plan to work with professional guideline organizations to expand access to our hereditary cancer testing products. &#160;

&#160; 2. Launch new products across a diverse set of disease indications &#151;We plan to continue to use our proprietary DNA sequencing, RNA expression and protein analysis technologies, including our supporting bioinformatics and robotic technologies, in an effort to efficiently discover important genes and their proteins and to understand their role in human disease. Based on these biomarkers, we plan to develop highly accurate, informative tests that may help physicians better manage their patients&#146; healthcare. We believe that our technologies provide us with a significant competitive advantage and the potential for numerous product opportunities. Our goal is to commercialize informative molecular diagnostic tests that can save lives and improve the quality of life of patients. In addition to the 

&#160; 

&#160; commercially marketed products mentioned below in our molecular diagnostic testing segment we have a pipeline of additional publicly announced tests. We believe the global market for all of our commercial and pipeline products exceeds $25 billion annually. &#160;

&#160; 3. Expand our molecular diagnostic business internationally &#151;We believe that the market for our molecular diagnostic products in Europe, Latin America and Asia represents an attractive commercial opportunity. We have established sales offices in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, Australia and Canada; laboratory operations in Germany; and international headquarters in Switzerland. We believe that our portfolio of products would benefit patients worldwide by assisting physicians in guiding their health care decisions. Molecular Diagnostic Testing 

Our molecular diagnostic tests are designed to analyze genes, their expression levels and corresponding proteins to assess an individual&#146;s risk for developing disease later in life, accurately diagnose disease, determine a patient&#146;s likelihood of responding to a particular drug, or assess a patient&#146;s risk of disease progression and disease recurrence. Provided with this valuable information, physicians may more effectively manage their patient&#146;s healthcare to prevent or delay the onset of disease and help ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment for their disease. 

Below are the descriptions of our primary molecular diagnostic tests: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; myRisk&#153; Hereditary Cancer: DNA sequencing test for assessing the risks for hereditary cancers. Our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test represents the next generation of our existing hereditary cancer testing franchise which we anticipate will eventually replace our current predictive medicine test offerings (BRAC Analysis , BART, Colaris and Colaris AP and Melaris) with a single comprehensive test. myRisk Hereditary Cancer is designed to determine a patient&#146;s hereditary cancer risk for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, uterine cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and gastric cancer. The test analyzes 25 separate genes to look for deleterious mutations that would put a patient at a substantially higher risk than the general population for developing one or more of the above cancers. All 25 genes in the panel are well documented in clinical literature for the role they play in hereditary cancer and have been shown to have actionable clinical interventions for the patient to lower disease risk or risk of cancer recurrence. The myRisk report presents the myRisk Genetic Test Result and myRisk Management Tool that summarizes published management guidelines related to the patient&#146;s genetic mutation as well as their personal and family history of cancer. myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing identifies more mutation carriers than BRAC Analysis &#174; and COLARIS &#174; combined. We believe the global market for myRisk Hereditary Cancer and all of our hereditary cancer tests is approximately $5 billion annually. myRisk Hereditary Cancer was initially released through an early access launch that began in September 2013. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; BRACAnalysis &#174; : DNA sequencing test for assessing the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Our BRAC Analysis test is an analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes for assessing a woman&#146;s risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. A woman who tests positive for a deleterious mutation with the BRAC Analysis test has up to an 87% risk of developing breast cancer and up to a 44% risk of developing ovarian cancer by age 70. As published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute , researchers have shown that pre-symptomatic individuals who have a high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer can reduce their risk by more than 50% with appropriate preventive therapies. Additionally, BRAC Analysis may be used to assist patients already diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer and their physicians in determining the most appropriate therapeutic interventions to address their disease. 

According to the American Cancer Society, in 2016 there will be approximately 271,000 women in the United States diagnosed with breast cancer or ovarian cancer. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; BART &#174; : DNA sequencing test for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Our BART test is based on proprietary technology for detecting large genomic rearrangements in the genes involved in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer patients. As published in the journal Cancer , researchers have shown that up to 10% of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility is due to large rearrangement mutations that can&#146;t be detected using conventional sequencing technology. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; BRACAnalysis CDx TM : DNA sequencing test for use as a companion diagnostic with the PARP inhibitor Lynparza TM (olaparib) currently indicated for use in identifying ovarian cancer patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants eligible for treatment with Lynparza TM . Approximately 15% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer are BRCA positive. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Tumor BRACAnalysis CDx TM : DNA sequencing test designed to be utilized to predict response to DNA damaging agents such as platinum based chemotherapy agents and poly ADP ribose (PARP) inhibitors. Tumor BRACAnalysis CDx looks at both germline and somatic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes giving a more complete picture of potential loss of DNA repair ability within the tumor. Approximately 22% of epithelial ovarian cancer patients will test positive for Tumor BRACAnalysis CDx. Currently the test is only offered through our European laboratory in Munich Germany. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; COLARIS &#174; : DNA sequencing test for assessing the risk of colorectal and uterine cancer. Our COLARIS test is an analysis of the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM and MYH genes for assessing a person&#146;s risk of developing colorectal and uterine cancer. Individuals who carry a deleterious mutation in one of the colon cancer genes in the COLARIS test have a greater than 80% lifetime risk of developing colon cancer and women have up to a 71% lifetime chance of developing uterine cancer. Colon cancer is a preventable disease if high-risk individuals diligently have colonoscopies and remove any precancerous polyps. 

According to the American Cancer Society, approximately 207,000 new cases of colorectal cancer or uterine cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; COLARIS AP &#174; : DNA sequencing test for assessing the risk of colorectal cancer. Our COLARIS AP test detects mutations in the APC and MYH genes, which cause a colon polyp-forming syndrome such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a more common variation of the syndrome known as attenuated FAP, and the MYH-associated polyposis signature (MAP). Individuals who carry a deleterious mutation in the APC or MYH gene may have a greater than 90% lifetime risk of developing colon cancer. Effective preventive measures include colonoscopy and the removal of pre-cancerous polyps and prophylactic surgery. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Vectra &#174; DA : protein detection test for assessing the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Our Vectra DA test is a quantitative, objective multi-biomarker blood test validated to measure rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity. Vectra DA assesses multiple mechanisms and pathways associated with RA disease activity and integrates the concentrations of 12 serum proteins into a single score reported on a scale of 1 to 100. The test may be used throughout the course of a patient&#146;s disease and provides clinicians with expanded insight on disease severity and the risk of radiographic progression. 

According to the Arthritis Foundation, there are over 1.5 million Americans with rheumatoid arthritis. We believe the global market for Vectra DA is approximately $3 billion annually. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Prolaris &#174; : RNA expression test for assessing the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Our Prolaris test is a gene expression assay that assesses whether a patient is likely to have a slow growing, indolent form of prostate cancer that can be safely monitored through active surveillance, or a more aggressive form of the disease that would warrant aggressive intervention such as a radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The Prolaris test was developed to improve physicians&#146; ability to predict disease outcome and to thereby optimize patient treatment. 

According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States approximately 181,000 men are expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2016. We believe the global market for Prolaris is approximately $1.5 billion annually. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; EndoPredict &#174; : RNA expression test for assessing the aggressiveness of breast cancer . The EndoPredict test is a next-generation RNA expression test used to determine which women with breast cancer would benefit from chemotherapy. EndoPredict predicts the likelihood of metastases to help guide treatment decisions for chemotherapy and extended anti-hormonal therapy. EndoPredict has been shown to accurately predict cancer-specific disease progression and metastases with no confusing intermediate results in 13 published clinical studies with more than 2,200 patients and is CE marked. We believe the global market opportunity for EndoPredict is greater than $600 million with the majority of that market existing in major European countries, Canada, and the United States. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; myPath &#153; Melanoma : RNA expression test for diagnosing melanoma. Our myPath Melanoma test is a gene expression based profile that is performed on biopsy tissue for the purpose of aiding a dermatopathologist in the diagnosis of melanoma. Every year in the United States, there are approximately two million skin biopsies performed specifically for the diagnosis of melanoma. Approximately 14% of these biopsies are classified as indeterminate where a dermatopathologist cannot make a definitive call as to whether the biopsy is benign or malignant. Outcomes for patients are poor if melanoma is not caught in early stages with five year survival rates dropping from 98% for localized to less than 20% for distant stage disease cancer based upon data from the American Cancer Society. We believe myPath Melanoma may provide an accurate tool to assist physicians in correctly diagnosing indeterminate skin lesions. 

We believe the global market for myPath Melanoma is approximately $1 billion annually. myPath Melanoma was released through an early access launch that began in November 2013. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; myChoice &#174; HRD : C ompanion diagnostic to measure three modes of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) including loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale state transitions in cancer cells. Our myChoice HRD test is the most comprehensive homologous recombination deficiency test to detect when a tumor has lost the ability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, resulting in increased susceptibility to DNA-damaging drugs such as platinum drugs or PARP inhibitors. The myChoice HRD score is a composite of three proprietary technologies: loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale state transitions. Positive myChoice HRD scores, reflective of DNA repair deficiencies, are prevalent in all breast cancer subtypes, ovarian and most other major cancers. In previously published data, Myriad showed that the myChoice HRD test predicted drug response to platinum therapy in certain patients with triple-negative breast and ovarian cancers. It is estimated that 1.4 million people in the United States and Europe who are diagnosed with cancers annually may be candidates for treatment with DNA-damaging agents. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; myPlan&#153; Lung Cancer : RNA expression test for assessing the aggressiveness of lung cancer. Our myPlan Lung Cancer test is a gene expression based profile that may aid a physician in making a determination as to the aggressiveness of a patient&#146;s lung cancer and based upon this determination more accurately guide patient therapy. Most early stage lung cancer patients do not see added benefit from chemotherapy. We believe the global market for myPlan Lung Cancer is approximately $200 million annually. 

myPlan Lung Cancer was released through an early access launch that began in October 2013. 

Pharmaceutical and Clinical Services 

Our pharmaceutical and clinical services consist of the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Through Myriad RBM, we provide biomarker discovery and pharmaceutical and clinical services to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical research industries utilizing our multiplexed immunoassay technology. Our technology enables us to efficiently screen large sets of well-characterized clinical samples from both diseased and non-diseased populations against our extensive menu of biomarkers. During the year ended June 30, 2016, Myriad RBM accounted for 3.6% of total revenue. In addition to the fees received from analyzing these samples, we also use this information to create and validate potential companion diagnostic test panels. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; On February 27, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Privatklinik Dr. Robert Schindlbeck GmbH &#38; Co. KG (the &#147;Clinic&#148;) located approximately 15 miles from the Company&#146;s European laboratories in Munich, Germany for total consideration of $20.1 million. We believe the acquisition of the Clinic should allow us to have better access to payors. 

The Molecular Diagnostic Industry and Competition 

The markets in which we compete are rapidly evolving, and we face competition from multiple public companies, private companies, and academic/university laboratories for a number of our laboratory testing services. 

In the hereditary cancer testing market we have faced increased competition since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2013 invalidated some of the key patent claims covering our hereditary cancer testing products. These patents were originally set to begin expiring in 2015 and beyond. Since this Supreme Court decision, numerous large reference laboratories, small private laboratories, and academic/university laboratories have launched competing hereditary cancer tests. Despite the impact from competition, we continue to have a dominant market position in hereditary cancer testing. 

The market for hereditary cancer testing has evolved dramatically over time. Broad reimbursement coverage for hereditary cancer tests began emerging in the early 2000s and coupled with increased public awareness around genetics and Myriad&#146;s marketing and promotional efforts, there has been significant growth in testing volumes. One of the largest drivers of growth has been increased testing in asymptomatic patients in the preventive care setting which now comprise nearly half of all tests performed in the United States. We are working to continue to expand awareness around hereditary cancer testing and expand the number of patients that qualify for hereditary cancer testing under medical guidelines and health insurance coverage policies. 

Another factor influencing the marketplace has been the advent of next generation sequencing. This has allowed the transition from single syndrome tests to targeted pan-cancer panels in a cost effective manner without sacrificing test accuracy. We launched our first pan-cancer panel, myRisk Hereditary Cancer, in September, 2013, and we believe panel based tests will become standard of care in the marketplace based upon their greater sensitivity at finding cancer causing mutations. We have presented multiple studies showing that myRisk Hereditary Cancer can detect greater than 60 percent more deleterious mutations when compared to our legacy hereditary cancer tests. 

Myriad competes in the hereditary cancer testing market based upon several factors including: 

&#160;

&#160; 1) the analytical accuracy of our tests &#160;

&#160; 2) our ability to classify genetic variants in hereditary cancer genes &#160;

&#160; 3) the quality of our sales and marketing for our products &#160;

&#160; 4) the quality of our customer service and support &#160;

&#160; 5) turnaround time; and &#160;

&#160; 6) value We believe that we have substantial advantages in terms of our test accuracy and ability to classify variants. Based on our testing experience of over 2.0 million patients, and our substantial investments in our variant classification program, we have compiled a proprietary database of over 40,000 unique genetic variants in the genes tested by myRisk Hereditary Cancer. We believe this database allows us to provide more accurate results to patients and return a variant of unknown significance (VUS) result to patients less frequently. We have demonstrated that this classification advantage leads to lower long-term healthcare costs and lower utilization of unnecessary healthcare services. 

&#160; 

Given our scale relative to other laboratories in the hereditary cancer testing market, we believe we also have substantial competitive advantages in terms of cost efficiencies and laboratory automation, which leads to faster turnaround times for our tests. 

In the urology market, we compete against a small number of public and private companies for our prostate cancer prognostic test, Prolaris. We compete in this market primarily based upon the quality of the clinical data supporting the test, its first mover advantage in the marketplace and the strength of its sales support and customer service. 

In the autoimmune market, our Vectra DA test competes primarily against traditional methodologies for assessing rheumatoid arthritis disease activity such as a physician&#146;s clinical assessment of the patient and single marker laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP). We believe we have the only clinically validated multi-biomarker product on the market to assess rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. 

In the pharmaceutical and clinical services segment, our Myriad RBM division competes against other contract research organizations and academic laboratories for business from pharmaceutical and research customers. 

Sales and Marketing 

We sell our tests through our own direct sales force and marketing efforts in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada. Our United States sales force is comprised of approximately 502 individuals across five separate sales channels. In connection with any additional tests that we may launch, we plan to expand our existing oncology, preventive care, urology, dermatology, and autoimmune care sales forces, and build new sales forces to address other physician specialty groups. We have entered into distributor agreements with organizations in selected European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, Asian and African countries. 

Research and Development 

We plan to continue to use our proprietary DNA sequencing, RNA expression and protein analysis technologies, including our supporting bioinformatics and robotic technologies, in an effort to efficiently discover important genes and their proteins and to understand their role in human disease. Based on these biomarkers we plan to develop highly accurate, informative tests that may help physicians better manage their patients&#146; healthcare. We believe that our technologies provide us with a significant competitive advantage and the potential for numerous product opportunities. For the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had research and development expense of $70.6 million, $75.5 million, and $67.5 million, respectively. 

Acquisitions 

We intend to continue to take advantage of in-licensing or acquisition opportunities to augment our internal research and development programs. We recognize that we cannot meet all of our research discovery goals internally and can benefit from the research performed by other organizations. We hope to leverage our financial strength, product development expertise, and sales and marketing presence to acquire new product opportunities in our molecular diagnostic areas of focus. 

In February 2014, we completed the acquisition of privately-held Crescendo Bioscience, Inc. (&#147;Crescendo&#148;) for $270 million in cash, which was reduced by the repayment of a loan made to Crescendo and other customary adjustments in accordance with the acquisition agreement. We believe that the acquisition of Crescendo facilitates our entry into the high growth autoimmune and inflammatory disease market, diversifies our product revenues and enhances our strength in protein-based diagnostics. The business of Crescendo, including its Vectra &#174; DA blood test for rheumatoid arthritis disease management, is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary. 

In February 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Clinic located in Germany approximately 15 miles from our European laboratories in Munich, Germany for total consideration of $20.1 million. We believe the acquisition of 

&#160; 

the Clinic should facilitate our penetration into the German molecular diagnostic market. The Clinic will allow us to directly negotiate reimbursement with government and private insurance providers in the German market and collaborate with hospitals and physician groups. 

In May 2016, we completed the acquisition of Sividon Diagnostics GmbH (&#147;Sividon&#148;), a leading breast cancer prognostic company, for $39.0 million upfront with the potential for &#128;15.0 million ($16.7 million converted at the June 30, 2016 period end exchange rate) in additional performance-based milestones. We believe the acquisition brings us the best-in-class breast cancer prognostic test and strengthens our market leading oncology portfolio of high value personalized medicine products. 

Seasonality 

We experience seasonality in our testing business. The volume of testing is negatively impacted by the summer holiday season which is generally reflected in our fiscal first quarter. Our fiscal second quarter ending December 31 is generally strong as we see an increase in volume from patients who have met their annual insurance deductible. Conversely, fiscal third quarter ending March 31 is typically negatively impacted by the annual reset of patient deductibles. Additionally, we can experience increases in testing volume due to celebrity publicity. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

We own or have license rights to various issued patents as well as patent applications in the United States and foreign countries. These patents and patent applications cover a variety of subject matter including, diagnostic biomarkers, gene expression signatures, antibodies, primers, probes, assays, disease-associated genetic mutations, methods for determining genetic predisposition, methods for disease diagnosis, methods for determining disease progression, methods for disease treatment, methods for determining disease treatment, and general molecular diagnostic techniques. For some of the patent assets, we hold rights through exclusive or non-exclusive license agreements. We also own additional patent assets and hold other non-exclusive license rights to patents which cover various aspects of our tests or processes. Material patent assets relating to our tests that generate material revenue are described below. 

Vectra DA. We hold an exclusive license to one issued U.S. patent and pending U.S. patent applications relating to Vectra &#174; DA testing. This issued U.S. patent has a term expected to expire in 2031 and these U.S. applications, if issued as patents and depending on term adjustments or terminal disclaimers if applicable, are expected to have similar terms. These patents and applications contain multiple claims including but not limited to claims relating to biomarkers, kits, systems and methods for measuring and monitoring inflammatory disease activity. 

Prolaris. We own or hold an exclusive license to one allowed U.S. patent application and pending U.S. patent applications relating to Prolaris &#174; testing. This allowed U.S. patent application, if and when issued, will have a term expected to expire in 2031 and these U.S. applications, if issued as patents and depending on term adjustments or terminal disclaimers if applicable, are expected to have expiration timeframes ranging from 2030 to 2035. These patents and applications contain multiple claims including but not limited to claims relating to biomarkers, kits, systems and methods for detecting, diagnosing, prognosing and selecting therapy for prostate cancer. 

EndoPredict. We own or hold an exclusive license to two issued European patents and pending U.S. and European patent applications relating to EndoPredict &#174; testing. These issued European patents have a term expected to expire in 2031 and these U.S. and European applications, if issued as patents and depending on term adjustments or terminal disclaimers if applicable, are expected to have similar expiration timeframes. These patents and applications contain multiple claims including but not limited to claims relating to biomarkers, kits, systems and methods for prognosing and selecting therapy for breast cancer. 

myChoice HRD. We own or hold an exclusive license to two issued U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications relating to myChoice &#174; HRD testing. These issued U.S. patents have terms expected to expire in 2032 

&#160; 

and these U.S. applications, if issued as patents and depending on term adjustments or terminal disclaimers if applicable, are expected to have expiration timeframes ranging from 2031 to 2035. These patents contain multiple claims including but not limited to claims relating to biomarkers, kits, systems and methods for detecting homologous recombination deficiency and selecting therapy based on such detection. 

We intend to seek patent protection in the United States and major foreign jurisdictions for synthetic nucleic acids, antibodies, biomarker signatures, assays, probes, primers, technologies, methods, processes and other inventions which we believe are patentable and where we believe our interests would be best served by seeking patent protection. However, any patents issued to us or our licensors may not afford meaningful protection for our products or technology or may be subsequently circumvented, invalidated or narrowed or found unenforceable. Any patent applications which we have filed or will file or to which we have licensed or will license rights may not issue, and patents that do issue may not contain commercially valuable claims. In addition, others may obtain patents having claims which cover aspects of our tests or processes which are necessary for or useful to the development, use or performance of our diagnostic products. Should any other group obtain patent protection with respect to our discoveries, our commercialization of our molecular diagnostic tests could be limited or prohibited. 

Others may offer clinical diagnostic genomic laboratory testing services which may infringe patents we control. We may seek to negotiate a license to use our patent rights or decide to seek enforcement of our patent rights through litigation. Patent litigation is expensive and the outcome is often uncertain and we may not be able to enforce our patent rights against others. 

Our tests and processes may also conflict with patents which have been or may be granted to competitors, academic institutions or others. In addition, third parties could bring legal actions against us seeking to invalidate our owned or licensed patents, claiming damages, or seeking to enjoin clinical testing, developing and marketing of our tests or processes. If any of these actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could lose patent coverage for our tests, be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain a license in order to continue to develop or market the relevant test or process. We may not prevail in any such action, and any license required under any such patent may not be made available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to maintain patent protection for our test and processes or to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our tests and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, and in the future may determine in some cases that our interests would be better served by reliance on trade secrets or confidentiality agreements rather than patents or licenses. These include some of our genomic, proteomic, RNA expression, mutation analysis, robotic and bioinformatic technologies which may be used in discovering and characterizing new genes and proteins and ultimately used in the development or analysis of molecular diagnostic tests. We also maintain a database of gene mutations and their status as either harmful or benign for all of our hereditary cancer tests. To further protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require that our employees and consultants enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements. However, those confidentiality and invention assignment agreements may not provide us with adequate protection. We may not be able to protect our rights to such unpatented proprietary technology and others may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies. If we are unable to obtain strong proprietary rights to our processes or tests, competitors may be able to market competing processes and tests. 

License Agreements 

We are a party to license agreements which give us the rights to use certain technologies in the research, development, testing processes, and commercialization of our molecular diagnostic tests and pharmaceutical and clinical services. We may not be able to continue to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Additionally, patents underlying our license agreements may not afford meaningful protection for our technology or tests or may be subsequently circumvented, invalidated or narrowed, or found unenforceable. Our failure to maintain rights to this technology could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

In 2010, Crescendo Bioscience, Inc. (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) entered into a license agreement with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (the &#147;OMRF&#148;), for the exclusive world-wide right to utilize certain intellectual property rights of OMRF including patent applications relating to what is now Vectra DA testing. Under this license agreement we pay OMRF a royalty based on net sales of our Vectra DA test. This license agreement ends on expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the license agreement, which presently is not anticipated to expire until 2031. OMRF has the right to terminate the license agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the license agreement. 

In 2012, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (the &#147;UTMDACC&#148;), for the exclusive world-wide right to utilize certain rights of UTMDACC in intellectual property relating to what is now myChoice &#174; HRD testing. Under this license agreement we will pay UTMDACC a royalty based on net sales of our myChoice &#174; HRD test, if any. This license agreement ends on expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the license agreement, which presently is not anticipated to expire until 2032. UTMDACC has the right to terminate the license agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the license agreement. 

Governmental Regulation 

The services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from state and federal health care programs. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below. 

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation 

Each of our clinical laboratories must hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Laboratories in the United States that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (&#147;CLIA&#148;). CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification also is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. Our laboratories in Salt Lake City, Utah, Austin, Texas and South San Francisco, California are CLIA certified to perform high complexity tests. 

In addition, CLIA requires each of our certified laboratories to enroll in an approved proficiency testing program if performing testing in any category for which proficiency testing is required. Each of our laboratories periodically tests specimens received from an outside proficiency testing organization and then submits the results back to that organization for evaluation. If one of our laboratories fails to achieve a passing score on a proficiency test, then it loses its right to perform testing. Further, failure to comply with other proficiency testing regulations, such as the prohibition on referral of a proficiency testing specimen to another laboratory for analysis, can result in revocation of the laboratory&#146;s CLIA certification. 

As a condition of CLIA certification, each of our laboratories is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or, a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Because our laboratories are accredited by the College of American Pathologists (&#147;CAP&#148;), which is a CMS-approved accreditation organization, they are typically subject to CAP inspections. 

Our laboratories are licensed by the appropriate state agencies in the states in which they operate, if such licensure is required. In addition, our laboratories hold state licenses or permits, as applicable, from California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Maryland, to the extent that they accept specimens from one or more of these states, each of which requires out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure. 

&#160; 

If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories or with CLIA, may include suspension, limitation or revocation of the license or CLIA certificate, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. Loss of a laboratory&#146;s CLIA certificate or state license may also result in the inability to receive payments from state and federal health care programs as well as private third party payors. We believe that we are in material compliance with CLIA and all applicable licensing laws and regulations. 

Food and Drug Administration 

Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has consistently claimed that it has the authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests (&#147;LDTs&#148;) that are developed, validated and performed only by a CLIA certified laboratory, it has historically exercised enforcement discretion in not otherwise regulating most LDTs and has not required laboratories that furnish LDTs to comply with the agency&#146;s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls). In recent years, however, the FDA has stated it intends to end its policy of general enforcement discretion and regulate certain LDTs as medical devices. To this end, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents, entitled &#147;Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)&#148; and &#147;FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)&#148;, respectively, that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs. The FDA has indicated that it does not intend to modify its policy of enforcement discretion until the draft guidance documents are finalized. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the draft guidance documents will be finalized, and even then, the new regulatory requirements are proposed to be phased-in consistent with the schedule set forth in the guidance (in as little as 12 months after the draft guidance is finalized for certain high-priority LDTs). Nevertheless, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time. LDTs with the same intended use as a cleared or approved companion diagnostic are defined in FDA&#146;s draft guidance as &#147;high-risk LDTs (Class III medical devices)&#148; for which premarket review would be first to occur. 

We are developing companion diagnostic tests for use with drug products in development by pharmaceutical companies, such as our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies on PARP inhibitors for the treatment of ovarian, breast and other cancers. Companion diagnostic tests are currently subject to regulation by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA issued Guidance on In-Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices in July 2014, which is intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product. The FDA defined an in vitro companion diagnostic device (&#147;IVD Companion Dx&#148;) as a device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an approved or cleared IVD Companion Dx in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding companion diagnostic will be developed contemporaneously. In December 2014, we obtained premarket approval (&#147;PMA&#148;) for BRAC Analysis CDx, which is used as a companion diagnostic to identify ovarian cancer patients who may benefit from AstraZeneca&#146;s PARP inhibitor Lynparza&#153; (olaparib). The premarket approval process is a complex, costly and time consuming procedure. PMAs must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including quality technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data to demonstrate to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the companion diagnostic. We are currently collaborating with several pharmaceutical companies, including an expanded collaboration with AstraZeneca for an additional indication for BRACAnalysis CDx, to evaluate the use of several of our tests as companion diagnostics with other drugs. 

After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; compliance with the FDA&#146;s Quality System Regulation (&#147;QSR&#148;), which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or &#147;off-label&#148; uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or serious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMAs of new devices; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMAs; and civil or criminal prosecution. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA. 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

Our laboratories are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples and other human tissue. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste. 

HIPAA and other privacy laws 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#147;HIPAA&#148;), established comprehensive federal standards for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (&#147;Covered Entities&#148;). Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. 

On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH expanded and strengthened HIPAA, created new targets for enforcement, imposed new penalties for noncompliance and established new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities. Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013 through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (the &#147;Omnibus Rule&#148;). 

Under HITECH&#146;s breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the &#147;Secretary&#148;). Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and, in some cases depending on the size of the breach; they must be reported through local and national media. Breach reports can lead to investigation, enforcement and civil litigation, including class action lawsuits. 

We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations and maintain an active compliance program that is designed to identify security incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, mitigate harm or 

&#160; 

report if required by law. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach. 

In May 2016, a complaint was filed with the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;OCR&#148;) by four patients alleging deficiencies in our policies regarding information that must be disclosed to patients as part of a &#147;designated record set&#148; under HIPAA. We proactively reached out to OCR on these issues to explain our compliance with all applicable regulations and OCR guidance. To date, this complaint has not resulted in any investigation or other action by OCR. 

A similar complaint was filed with the College of American Pathologists (&#147;CAP&#148;), which is the designated agency administering CLIA for Myriad Genetic Laboratories. We responded to CAP&#146;s notice of the complaint and, on July 27, 2016, received a letter notifying us that the matter has been closed. 

In addition to the federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our clinical laboratories. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results by strictly limiting the disclosure of those results. State requirements are particularly stringent regarding predictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a high risk for disease. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, including genetic testing and genetic information privacy laws in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, these laws constantly change and we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, significant reputational damage and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#147;OSHA&#148;) has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 

Transparency Laws and Regulations 

A federal law known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the &#147;Sunshine Act&#148;) requires medical device manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers must report data for the previous calendar year by the 90 th day of the then-current calendar year. CMS then publishes the data on a publicly available website no later than June 30 th. There are also state &#147;sunshine&#148; laws that require manufacturers to provide reports to state governments on pricing and marketing information. Several states have enacted legislation requiring medical device manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and such laws may also prohibit or limit certain other sales 

&#160; 

and marketing practices. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or to otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 

Reimbursement and Billing 

Reimbursement and billing for diagnostic services is highly complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as private third-party payors, including managed care organizations (&#147;MCO&#148;), and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing requirements. Additionally, the audit requirements we must meet to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process. Other factors that complicate billing include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; variability in coverage and information requirements among various payors; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; patient financial assistance programs; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; missing, incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; billings to payors with whom we do not have contracts; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; disputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; disputes with payors as to the appropriate level of reimbursement. 

Depending on the reimbursement arrangement and applicable law, the party that reimburses us for our services may be: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a third party who provides coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company or MCO; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; a state or federal healthcare program; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the patient. 

Presently, approximately 85% of our revenue comes from private third party payors. 

In February 2011, the American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology (&#147;CPT&#148;) Editorial Panel approved 101 new molecular pathology codes to describe molecular diagnostic tests that currently require multiple CPT codes for billing purposes. The new reimbursement rates for the new codes went into effect on January 1, 2013. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 

A variety of federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;OIG&#148;), and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. Any overpayments must be repaid within 60 days of identification unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments. 

Anti-Kickback Laws 

The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an 

&#160; 

individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. &#147;Remuneration&#148; is broadly defined to include anything of monetary value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. 

Recognizing the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors intended to protect such arrangements. Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors. 

Physician Self-Referral Bans 

The federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including but not limited to: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor. 

State and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims 

The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, as well as possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor. 

Civil Monetary Penalties Law 

The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary&#146;s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or 

&#160; 

contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense. 

International regulations 

We market some of our tests outside of the United States and are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical testing, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may require us to implement additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. On September 26, 2012, the European Commission released the first drafts of the new European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) regulations for medical devices and IVDs that if finalized will impose additional regulatory requirements on IVDs used in the EU. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. We are also required to maintain accurate information on and control over sales and distributors&#146; activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions. 

Human Resources 

As of June 30, 2016, we have over 2,206 full-time equivalent employees. Most of our employees are engaged directly in research, development, production, sales and marketing activities. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
