(&#8220;Investments&#8221;). Systems was incorporated on December 2, 1992, and was primarily established to franchise Big Apple Bagels&#174; (&#8220;BAB&#8221;) specialty bagel retail stores. My Favorite Muffin (&#8220;MFM&#8221;) was acquired in 1997 and is included as a part of Systems. Brewster&#8217;s (&#8220;Brewster&#8217;s&#8221;) was established in 1996 and the coffee is sold in BAB and MFM locations. SweetDuet&#174; (&#8220;SD&#8221;) frozen yogurt can be added as an additional brand in a BAB or MFM location. Operations was formed in 1995, primarily to operate Company-owned stores of which there are currently none. The assets of Jacobs Bros. Bagels (&#8220;Jacobs Bros.&#8221;) were acquired in 1999, and any branded wholesale business uses this trademark. Investments was incorporated in 2009 to be used for the purpose of acquisitions. To date there have been no acquisitions. 

&#160; 

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 12, 2000. The Company currently franchises and licenses bagel and muffin retail units under the BAB and MFM trade names. At November 30, 2015, the Company had 84 franchise units and 3 licensed units in operation in 23 states and one international location. There are 7 units under development. The Company additionally derives income from the sale of its trademark bagels, muffins and coffee through nontraditional channels of distribution including under licensing agreements with Kohr Bros. Frozen Custard, Kaleidoscoops and Green Beans Coffee. Also, included in licensing fees and other income is Operations Sign Shop results. For franchise consistency and convenience, the Sign Shop provides the majority of signage to franchisees, including but not limited to, menu panels, build charts, interior and exterior signage and point of purchase materials. 

&#160; 

The BAB franchised brand consists of units operating as &#8220;Big Apple Bagels&#174;,&#8221; featuring daily baked bagels, flavored cream cheeses, premium coffees, gourmet bagel sandwiches and other related products. Licensed BAB units serve the Company&#39;s frozen bagel and related products baked daily. BAB units are primarily concentrated in the Midwest and Western United States. The MFM brand consists of units operating as "My Favorite Muffin&#174;," featuring a large variety of freshly baked muffins, coffees and related products, and units operating as "My Favorite Muffin and Bagel Cafe," featuring these products as well as a variety of specialty bagel sandwiches and related products. The SweetDuet&#174; brand is a fusion concept, pairing self-serve frozen yogurt with MFM&#8217;s exclusive line of My Favorite Muffin gourmet muffins. SD frozen yogurt can be added as an additional brand in a BAB or MFM location. Although the Company doesn&#39;t actively market Brewster&#39;s stand-alone franchises, Brewster&#39;s coffee products are sold in most franchised units. 

&#160; 

The Company is leveraging on the natural synergy of distributing muffin products in existing BAB units and, alternatively, bagel products and Brewster&#39;s Coffee in existing MFM units. The Company expects to continue to realize efficiencies in servicing the combined base of BAB and MFM franchisees. 

&#160; 

Net Income 

The Company reported net income of $110,000 and $512,000 for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160; 

Food Service Industry 

Food service businesses are often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional, and local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Multi-unit food service chains, such as the Company&#39;s, can also be substantially adversely affected by publicity resulting from problems with food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one store or a limited number of stores. The food service business is also subject to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather or other conditions could negatively affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients and other food products. In addition, factors such as inflation, increased food and labor costs, regional weather conditions, availability and cost of suitable sites and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the food service industry in general and the Company&#39;s results of operations and financial condition in particular. 

&#160; 

CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s franchisees represent a varied geographic and demographic group. Among some of the primary services the Company provides to its franchisees are marketing assistance, training, time-tested successful recipes, bulk purchasing discounts, food service knowledgeable personnel and brand recognition. 

&#160; 

SUPPLIERS 

&#160; 

The Company&#39;s major suppliers are Coffee Bean International, Dawn Food Products, Inc., Schreiber Foods, Coca-Cola and U.S. Foods. The Company is not dependent on any of these suppliers for future growth and profitability since like products may be purchased from these suppliers are available from other sources. 

&#160; 

LOCATIONS 

&#160; 

The Company had 84 franchised locations and 3 licensed units in 23 states and one international location. There are 7 units under development. 

&#160; 

STORE OPERATIONS 

&#160; 

BIG APPLE BAGELS&#174;--BAB franchised stores bake a variety of fresh bagels daily and offer up to 11 flavors of cream cheese spreads. Stores also offer a wide assortment of breakfast and lunch bagel sandwiches, salads, soups, various dessert items, fruit smoothies, gourmet coffees and other beverages. A typical BAB store is in an area with a mix of both residential and commercial properties and ranges from 1,500 to 2,000 square feet. The Company&#39;s current store design is approximately 1,800 square feet, with seating capacity for 20 to 30 persons, and includes approximately 750 square feet devoted to production and baking. A satellite store is typically smaller than a production store, averaging 800 to 1,200 square feet. Although franchise stores may vary in size from other franchise stores, store layout is generally consistent. 

&#160; 

MY FAVORITE MUFFIN&#174;--MFM franchised stores bake 20 to 25 varieties of muffins daily from over 250 recipes, plus a variety of bagels. They also serve gourmet coffees, beverages and, at My Favorite Muffin and Bagel Cafe locations, a variety of bagel sandwiches and related products.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

FRANCHISING 

&#160; 

The Company requires payment of an initial franchise fee per store, plus an ongoing 5% royalty on net sales. Additionally, BAB, MFM and SD franchisees are members of a marketing fund requiring an ongoing 3% contribution for general system-wide marketing. The Company currently requires a franchise fee of $25,000 on a franchisee&#39;s first full production BAB or MFM store. There is currently a $10,000 veterans discount for the franchise fee for the first location. The fee for subsequent production stores for BAB and MFM is $20,000. Beginning in 2014, the SD concept is available at no additional charge as an added brand to a BAB or MFM location. 

&#160; 

The Company&#39;s current Franchise Disclosure Documents (&#8220;FDD&#8221;) provides for, among other things, the opportunity for prospective franchisees to enter into a Preliminary Agreement for their first production store. This agreement enables a prospective franchisee a period of 60 days in which to locate a site. The fee for this Preliminary Agreement is $10,000. If a site is not located and approved by the Company within the 60 days, the prospective franchisee will receive a refund of $7,000. If a site is approved, the entire $10,000 will be applied toward the initial franchise fee. See also last paragraph under "Government Regulation" section in this 10-K. The Company&#39;s Franchise Agreement provides a franchisee with the right to develop one store at a specific location. Each Franchise Agreement is for a term of 10 years with the right to renew. Franchisees are expected to be in operation no later than 10 months following the signing of the Franchise Agreement. 

&#160; 

In 2014 a Master Franchise Agreement (&#8220;MFA&#8221;) was entered into with a Dubai based organization which includes ten Middle East Countries. The MFA is for $200,000, is nonrefundable and represents full payment for the MFA and the first fifteen owned by the Master Franchisee, and/or franchised locations. There was an initial payment of $100,000 paid upon execution of the agreement, $50,000 was paid April 2015 and the remaining $50,000 was paid September 2015. Master Franchisee owned BAB locations will pay a 3% royalty and service fee on gross sales. All BAB locations under the MFA operated by a franchisee will pay BAB Systems 50% of the current royalty and service fee payable to the Master Franchisee. The first Big Apple Bagels location, which is owned by the Master Franchisee, opened October 2015. 

&#160; 

The Company currently advertises its franchising opportunities in directories, newspapers and the internet. In addition, prospective franchisees contact the Company as a result of patronizing an existing store. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The quick service restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to product quality, concept, location, service and price. There are a number of national, regional and local chains operating both owned and franchised stores which compete with the Company on a national level or solely in a specific market or region. The Company believes that because the industry is extremely fragmented, there is a significant opportunity for expansion in the bagel, muffin, frozen yogurt and coffee concept chains. 

&#160; 

The Company believes the primary direct competitors of its bagel units are Panera Bread Company, Bruegger&#39;s Bagel Bakery and Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, which operate Einstein Bros. Bagels. There are several other regional bagel chains with fewer than 50 stores, as well as numerous small, independently owned bagel bakeries and national fast food restaurants such as Dunkin&#8217; Donuts and McDonald&#8217;s, all of which may compete with the Company. There is no major national competitor in the muffin business, but there are a number of regional and local operators. The Company believes the primary direct competitors for its yogurt concept are Red Mango, Yogurtland and TCBY. There are several regional and a number of local individual operators. Additionally, the Company competes directly with a number of national, regional and local coffee competitors. 

&#160; 

Other competition includes supermarket bakery sections and prepackaged, fresh and frozen bagels, muffins and yogurt. Certain of these competitors may have greater product and name recognition and larger financial, marketing and distribution capabilities than the Company. The Company believes the startup costs associated with opening a retail food establishment offering similar products on a stand-alone basis are competitive with the startup costs associated with opening its stores and, accordingly, such startup costs are not an impediment to entry into the retail bagel, muffin, frozen yogurt or coffee businesses. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company believes that its stores compete favorably in terms of food quality, and taste, convenience and customer service and value, which the Company believes are important factors to its targeted customers. Competition in the food service industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic and real estate conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns, the cost and availability of labor, consumer purchasing power, availability of product and local competitive factors. The Company attempts to manage or adapt to these factors, but not all such factors are within the Company&#39;s control. Such factors could cause the Company and some or all of its franchisees to be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

The Company competes for qualified franchisees with a wide variety of investment opportunities in the restaurant business, as well as other industries. Investment opportunities in the bagel bakery cafe business include franchises offered by Einstein Noah Restaurant Group, Panera Bread Company and opportunities in the frozen yogurt business, including Red Mango, Yogurtland and TCBY. The Company&#39;s continued success is dependent on its reputation for providing high quality and value with respect to its service, products and franchises. This reputation is affected by the performance of its franchise stores and licensed units that sell branded products over which the Company has limited control. 

&#160; 

TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS 

&#160; 

The trademarks, trade names and service marks used by the Company contain common descriptive English words and thus may be subject to challenge by users of these words, alone or in combination with other words, to describe other services or products. Some persons or entities may have prior rights to these names or marks in their respective localities. Accordingly, there is no assurance that such names and marks are available in all locations. Any challenge, if successful, in whole or in part, could restrict the Company&#39;s use of the names and marks in areas in which the challenger is found to have used the name or mark prior to the Company&#39;s use. Any such restriction could limit the expansion of the Company&#39;s use of the names or marks into that region, and the Company and its franchisees may be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160; 

The trademarks and service marks "Big Apple Bagels&#174;," "My Favorite Muffin&#174;," &#8220;SweetDuet&#174;&#8221;and "Brewster&#39;s&#174; Coffee" are registered under applicable federal trademark law. These marks are licensed by the Company to its franchisees pursuant to Franchise Agreements. In February 1999, the Company acquired the trademark of "Jacobs Bros. Bagels&#174;" upon purchasing certain assets of Jacobs Bros. The "Jacobs Bros. Bagels&#174;" mark is also registered under applicable federal trademark law. 

&#160; 

The Company is aware of the use by other persons and entities in certain geographic areas of names and marks which are the same as, or similar to, the Company&#39;s names and marks. Some of these persons or entities may have prior rights to those names or marks in their respective localities; therefore, there is no assurance that the names and marks are available in all locations. It is the Company&#39;s policy to pursue registration of its names and marks whenever possible and to vigorously oppose any infringement of its names and marks. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to the Trade Regulation Rule of the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") entitled &#8220;Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures&#39;&#39; (the "FTC Franchise Rule") and state and local laws and regulations that govern the offer, sale and termination of franchises and the refusal to renew franchises. Continued compliance with these broad federal, state and local regulatory networks is essential and costly. The failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company and its franchisees. Violations of franchising laws and/or state laws and regulations regulating substantive aspects of doing business in a particular state could limit the Company&#39;s ability to sell franchises or subject the Company and its affiliates to rescission offers, monetary damages, penalties, imprisonment and/or injunctive proceedings. In addition, under court decisions in certain states, absolute vicarious liability may be imposed upon franchisors based upon claims made against franchisees. Even if the Company is able to obtain insurance coverage for such claims, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover potential claims against the Company. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company and its franchisees are required to comply with federal, state and local government regulations applicable to consumer food service businesses, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food, minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety conditions, citizenship requirements, as well as regulations relating to zoning, construction, health and business licensing. Each store is subject to regulation by federal agencies and to licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new Company-owned or franchise store, and failure to remain in compliance with applicable regulations could cause the temporary or permanent closing of an existing store. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with these provisions. Continued compliance with these federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly but essential, and failure to comply may have an adverse effect on the Company and its franchisees. 

&#160; 

The Company&#39;s franchising operations are subject to regulation by the FTC under the Uniform Franchise Act which requires, among other things, that the Company prepare and periodically update a comprehensive disclosure document known as a FDD in connection with the sale and operation of its franchises. In addition, some states require a franchisor to register its franchise with the state before it may offer a franchise to a prospective franchisee. The Company believes its FDD, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, comply with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which it has offered franchises. 

&#160; 

The Company is also subject to a number of state laws, as well as foreign laws (to the extent it offers franchises outside of the United States), that regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including, but not limited to, those concerning termination and non-renewal of a franchise. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of November 30, 2015, the Company employed 17 persons in the Corporate headquarters, consisting of 16 full time and 1 part-time employees. The employees are responsible for corporate management and oversight, franchising, accounting, advertising and Sign Shop operations. None of the Company&#39;s employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements and management considers its relations with its employees to be good.
