 ITEM 1 BUSINESS 

&#160;

OVERVIEW 

&#160;

Lifeway Foods, Inc. (the "Company" or "Lifeway") was co-founded in 1986 by Michael and Ludmila Smolyansky shortly after their emigration from Russia to the United States. Mr. and Mrs. Smolyansky were the first to successfully introduce Kefir to the U.S. consumer on a commercial scale, initially catering to ethnic consumers in the Chicago metropolitan area. In the thirty years that have followed, Lifeway has grown to become the largest producer and marketer of Kefir in the U.S. and an important player in the broader market spaces of probiotic-based products and natural, "better for you" foods. 

&#160;

PRODUCTS 

&#160;

Lifeway's primary product is drinkable kefir, a fermented dairy product. Kefir has a tart and tangy taste similar to yogurt and the consistency of a smoothie. Kefir also has a slightly effervescent quality all its own. Unlike yogurt though, Lifeway incorporates a unique blend of probiotic kefir cultures in the fermentation process. The probiotic feature, in concert with the base-line nutritional value of a staple beverage that is high in protein, calcium and vitamin D, and low in calories, presents a unique and differentiated taste profile that we believe appeals to a broad and growing demographic. 

&#160;

Because of its drinkable feature, kefir requires no spoon and is ideal for on-the-go consumption &#8230; straight from the bottle. Lifeway's Kefir is commonly consumed as part of a healthy breakfast or as an "any-time, better for you" snack in its native form or as a smoothie input. Kefir also serves as a base for lower-calorie dressings, dips, marinades, soups or sauces and as a basic ingredient in other healthy, home-prepared foods. Recipes are made available through the company's website. 

&#160;

In addition to the drinkable kefir that we broadly market to consumers of all ages, we also market and sell our ProBugs line of drinkable kefir which is delivered in our proprietary non-spill pouches (and in 3.5 oz. bottles) intended for children with caring, health-conscious parents. Our frozen kefir offers a nutritional profile similar to our drinkable kefir but in a frozen bar and pint size container conventionally thought of as an indulgent treat. In addition to kefir, Lifeway produces a variety of Kefir-based Eastern European style soft cheeses.

Product innovation and new product development 

&#160;

The company is committed to maintaining its position as the leading producer of Kefir and routinely evaluates opportunities for new product flavors and formulations, improved package design, new product configurations and other forms of routine innovation. As of December 31, 2015 the company offered over 50 unique varieties of its Kefir product including more than 20 unique flavors delivered to consumers on three different milk platforms (fat- free, 1% and whole milk) as well as in both organic and conventional ingredient profiles. During 2015 our routine innovations led to the introduction of several new items, including our new 16 ounce protein enhanced Kefir aimed at the fitness-oriented consumer looking to incorporate more protein into their diets. 

&#160;

Beyond routine innovation, the company has an on-going effort to extend the strength of the Lifeway brand and leverage the capabilities of the Lifeway organization into categories outside of the dairy aisle including into non-food categories. Though we have not yet delivered a product to the market place that has clear commercial viability, our efforts will continue. 

&#160;

The company's innovation, research and development efforts are largely accomplished leveraging an intuitive entrepreneurial, unstructured approach; not a highly formalized, distinct "R&#38;D" function commonly found with large food processors. Research and development costs are not significant.

Product Quality Assurance 

&#160;

The Company employs many skilled production managers across its three Kefir producing facilities who closely monitor our kefir-production process. The production managers have a complement of deep capabilities that spans from traditional dairy operations to the artisan, old-world practices first introduced by Michael and Ludmila Smolyansky at the inception of the Company. We conduct routine tests, tastings and evaluations to ensure that each batch of kefir conforms to the Company's product quality and safety standards. The Company leverages both on-site and third party quality control labs.

&#160;

The Company includes a clearly legible "freshness" code on every Kefir product in order to ensure that our customers enjoy only the freshest products. To maintain the best of product freshness in the channel, we expect our channel customers (a) to ensure that our products are delivered directly to the retailer's dairy cooler and (b) to rotate such product in a routine and timely way. Due to the perishable nature of our products and the costs associated with moving product back through the channel, the Company does not offer return privileges to any of its channel customers; however, from time to time we do provide our customers with allowances for non-saleable product. 

&#160;

DISTRIBUTION 

&#160;

Lifeway's products reach the consumer through three primary "route-to-market" pathways: 

Direct store delivery ("DSD"); Retail-direct; and, Distributor. Under the direct store delivery (DSD) route to market, we distribute our products directly to the grocer's dairy cooler using a fleet of company-owned vehicles and a team of seasoned Lifeway merchandisers who engage face-to-face with store management to ensure optimal product assortments and presentation. We operate our DSD model in the Chicago metropolitan area only. Sales to our DSD customers represents less than10% of total company net sales. 

&#160;

Under the retail-direct channel, our products are sold to the retailer and shipped to that retailer's distribution center. In turn our retail customer then delivers the product to their respective stores within their chain. Customers in this route-to-market grouping include among others Kroger, Wal Mart and Costco. Under the retail direct model, optimal product merchandising, assortments and product presentation are attended to by the retailer with support from Lifeway's broker network. Sales to our retail-direct customers represents about 50% of total company net sales. 

&#160;

Under the distributor channel, our products are sold to distributors and shipped to that distributors designated warehouse. In turn, our distributor customers then sell the product to their retail customers and ship the products to their retail customers. Our distributors often use a DSD model of their own to make deliveries directly to individual stores but also make deliveries to the retailer's warehouse. Our distributor customers include among others United Natural Foods, Kehe Foods and C&#38;S Wholesale. Optimal product merchandising, assortments and product presentation at the retail end of the channel are attended to by the distributor with support from Lifeway's broker network. Sales to our distributor customers represents about 40% of total company net sales. 

&#160;

Distribution outside of the U.S . 

&#160;

Substantially all of Lifeway's products are distributed within the United States; however, certain of our distributors sell our products to retailers in Mexico, Costa Rica, Dubai, Hong Kong, China, and the Caribbean. Additionally, the company's products reach a small number of consumers across Canada and in London, England under third party co-manufacturing agreements and in-country distributor arrangements.

Distribution arrangements 

&#160;

Beyond the customer's purchase order, we do not have written agreements with our distributors. Consequently we believe that our arrangements with distributors allow us the latitude to establish new relationships with distributors as the need arises. Lifeway does not offer exclusive territories to any of its distributors.

&#160;

Distributors are provided Lifeway products at wholesale prices for distribution to their retail accounts. Lifeway believes that the price at which its products are sold to its distributors is competitive with the prices generally paid by distributors for similar products in the markets served. Each distributor carries a line of Lifeway's products on its trucks, checks the retail stores for space allocated to Lifeway's products, determines inventory requirements of the store and places Lifeway products directly into the retailers' dairy cases. Lifeway believes this method of distribution best serves the needs of each retail store, and is the best available means to ensure consistency and quality of product handling, quality control, flavor selection and favorable retail display. 

&#160;

MARKETING 

&#160;

The Company engages in an on-going and wide variety marketing and media campaigns - primarily digital and social media, print advertising in some newspapers and magazines and to a lesser extent television advertising. These marketing and media efforts are complemented by participation in sponsorships of cultural and community events, various festivals, industry-related trade shows and in-store promotional events. Our marketing efforts also include co-op advertising programs with our retail customers and various couponing campaigns. 

&#160;

Our marketing efforts are aimed at stimulating demand with our existing consumers and at driving trial with new consumers by elevating Kefir awareness. Our Kefir awareness marketing seeks to promote the verifiable nutritional profile, purity and good taste of our Kefir and to promote the common perception that our products may have a particular health benefit, such as promoting digestion.

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

Lifeway competes with a limited number of other domestic kefir producers and consequently faces a small amount of direct competition for kefir products; however, Lifeway's kefir-based products compete with other dairy products, notably yogurt. Many producers of yogurt and other dairy products are well-established and have significantly greater financial resources than Lifeway to promote their products.

&#160;

SUPPLIERS 

&#160;

We purchase our ingredients such as raw milk, cane and other forms of sugar and packaging materials from unaffiliated suppliers. Lifeway is not limited or contractually bound to any supplier beyond the terms of our purchase orders, which generally do not exceed our expected demand for periods more than one year. Lifeway has ready access to multiple suppliers for all of its ingredients and packaging requirements.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS 

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015 one distributor, United Natural Foods, Inc., represented approximately 19% of the Company's total sales and one retail customer, Kroger, represented approximately 7% of the Company's total sales. These customers collectively accounted for approximately 19% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

SEGMENTS 

&#160;

The Company has determined that it has one reportable segment based on how the Company's chief operating decision maker manages the business and in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing company performance, has been identified collectively as the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors. Substantially all of the consolidated revenues of the Company relate to the sale of fermented dairy products which are produced using the same processes and materials and are sold to consumers through a network of distributors and retailers in the United States. 

&#160;

GROUPE DANONE SA 

&#160;

Since October, 1999 Groupe Danone SA has been the beneficial owner of approximately 20% of the outstanding common stock of Lifeway. Lifeway and Danone are parties to a Stockholders' Agreement dated October 1, 1999, which as amended provides Danone the right to nominate one director, provides Danone with anti-dilutive rights relating to future offerings and grants Danone limited registration rights. 

&#160;

Danone's interest as of December 31, 2015 was approximately 21%.
