 Item 1. Business . 

Overview 

We are a Delaware financial holding company and our primary subsidiary, wholly owned, is The Bancorp Bank, which we refer to as the Bank. The vast majority of our revenue and income is currently generated through the Bank. In our continuing operations, we have four primary lines of specialty lending: securities backed lines of credit, or SBLOC, automobile fleet and other equipment leasing, Small Business Administration, or SBA, loans and loans generated for sale into capital markets primarily through both commercial mortgage backed securities, or CMBS and collateralized loan obligations , or C LOs. SBLOCs are loans which are generated through institutional banking affinity groups and are collateralized by marketable securities. SBLOCs are typically offered in conjunction with brokerage accounts and are offered nationally. Automobile fleet and other equipment leases are generated in a number of Atlantic Coast and other states. SBA loans and loans generated for sale into CMBS and CLO capital markets are made nationally. At December 31, 2015, SBLOC, leasing, SBA and loans for sale in secondary markets totaled $575.9 million, $231.5 million, $307.1 million (including SBA loans held for sale) and $380.8 million, respectively, and comprised 37%, 15%, 20% and 24% of our loan portfolio and loans held for sale. Our investment portfolio amounted to $1.16 billion at December 31, 2015, representing a decrease from the prior year as a portion of repayments and sales proceeds funded loan growth. 

For our institutional banking, including SBLOC and our other deposit generating activities, we focus on providing our services to organizations with a pre-existing customer base who can use one or more selected banking services tailored to support or complement the services provided by these organizations to their customers. These services include private label banking for investment advisory companies through our institutional banking department; credit and debit card processing for merchants affiliated with independent service organizations; and prepaid cards for general purpose card sponsors, insurers, incentive plans, large retail chains, consumer service organizations and others. We typically provide these services under the name and through the facilities of each organization with whom we develop a relationship. &#160; We refer to this, generally, as affinity group banking. Our prepaid card, private label banking for investment advisory compani es and card payment processing are our primary sources of deposits. The vast majority of our services are provided in the United States although we have limited prepaid card operations in Europe. 

Our main office is located at 409 Silverside Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19809 and our telephone number is (302) 385-5000. Our web address is www.thebancorp.com. We make available free of charge on our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports and our proxy statements as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with the SEC. Investors are encouraged to access these reports and other information about our business on our website, www.thebancorp.com. Information found on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We also will provide copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, free of charge, upon written request to our Investor Relations Department at the Company&#8217;s address for its principal executive offices, 409 Silverside Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19809. Also posted on our website, and available in print upon request by any shareholder to our Investor Relations Department, are the charters of the standing committees of our Board of Directors and standards of conduct governing our directors, officers and employees. 

Our Strategies 

Our principal strategies are to: 

&#160; 

Fund our Loan and Investment Portfolio Growth through Low-cost Deposits and Generate Noninterest Income from Prepaid Cards and Other Areas. Our principal focus is to grow our specialty lending operations and investment portfolio, and fund the loans and investments through a variety of sources that provide low cost and stable deposits. Funding sources include prepaid cards, institutional banking money market accounts and card payment processing. The largest component of our deposits is prepaid cards and the largest component of our noninterest income is derived from prepaid cards. 

Develop Relationships with Affinity Groups to Gain Sponsored Access to their Membership, Client or Customer Bases to Market our Services. We seek to develop relationships with organizations with established membership, client or customer bases. Through these affinity group relationships, we gain access to an organization&#8217;s members, clients and customers under the organization&#8217;s sponsorship. We believe that by marketing targeted products and services to these constituencies through their pre-existing relationships with the organizations, we will continue to generate lower cost deposits, generate fee income and, with respect to private label banking, lower our customer acquisition costs and build close customer relationships. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Use Our Existing Infrastructure as a Platform for Growth. We have made significant investments in our banking infrastructure to support our growth. We believe that this infrastructure can accommodate significant additional growth without proportionate increases in expense. We believe that this infrastructure enables us to maximize efficiencies through economies of scale as we grow without adversely affecting our relationships with our customers. 

&#160; 

Deposit Products and Services. &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

We offer a range of products and services to our affinity groups and their client bases, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

checking accounts; 

&#183; 

savings accounts; 

&#183; 

money market accounts; 

&#183; 

commercial accounts; and 

&#183; 

various types of prepaid and payroll cards. 

&#160; 

Lending &#160; Activities 

&#160; 

In the third quarter of 2014, we discontinued our &#160; commercial lending operations following our determination that those operations were inconsistent with our strategic focus on generating low cost deposits and deploying that funding into lower risk, more granular and national lines of business. We have sold loans with a n approximate book value of $342.2 million . On the date of discontinuance, September 30, 2014 there was approximate ly $1.1 billion in book value of loans in th e discontinued portfolio . The $342.2 million of loans sold had a face value of approximately $417.1 million. These sales were comprised of the following: Loans with an approximate face and book value of $267.6 million and $192.7 million, respectively, were sold in the fourth quarter of 2014 to a private securitization entity . The securitization is managed by an independent investor, which contributed $16 million of equity to that entity. The balance of the sale was financed by the Bank and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as investment in unconsolidated entity . After $74.9 million of loan charges reflected in the difference between the face value and book value of the loans sold to the securitization, we recognized a gain of $17.0 million. In the second quarter of 2015, an additional $149.6 million of loans were sold at a gain of approximately $2.2 million . &#160; At December 31, 2015 our net discontinued loan portfolio amounted to $568.7 million . We &#160; continue to pursue additional loan sales. We currently focus our lending activities upon four specialty lending segments: SBLOC loans, automobile fleet and other equipment leasing, SBA loans and loans originated for sale into CMBS and CLO capital markets. 

&#160; 

SBLOC . We make loans to individuals, trusts and entities which are secured by a pledge of marketable securities maintained in one or more accounts with respect to which we obtain a securities account control agreement. The securities pledged may be either debt or equity securities or a combination thereof, but all such securities must be listed for trading on a national securities exchange or automated inter-dealer quotation system. SBLOCs are typically payable on demand. Most of our SBLOCs are drawn to meet a specific need of the borrower (such as for bridge financing of real estate) and are typically drawn for 12 to 18 months at a time. Maximum SBLOC line amounts are calculated by applying a standard &#8216;advance rate&#8217; calculation against the eligible security type depending on asset class: typically up to 5 0% for equity securities and mutual fund securities and 8 0% for investment grade (Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s rating of BBB- or higher or Moody&#8217;s rating of Baa3 or higher) municipal or corporate debt securities. Borrowers generally must have a credit score of 660 or higher, although we may allow exceptions based upon a review of the borrower&#8217;s income, assets and other credit information. All SBLOCs are with full recourse to the borrower. The underlying securities that act as collateral for our SBLOC commitments are monitored on a daily basis to confirm the composition of the client portfolio and its daily market value. Although these accounts are closely monitored, severely falling markets or sudden drops in price with respect to individual pledged securities could result in the loan being under-collateralized and consequently in default and, upon sale of the collateral, could result in losses to the Bank. 

&#160; 

Leases . We provide lease financing for commercial and government automobile fleets and, to a lesser extent, provide lease financing for other equipment. Our leases are either open end or closed end. An open end lease is one in which, at the end of the lease term, the lessee must pay us the difference between the amount at which we sell the leased asset and the stated &#8220;residual value.&#8221; &#8220;Residual value&#8221; is a contractual value agreed to by the parties at the inception of a lease as to the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term. A closed end lease is one in which no such payment is due on lease termination. In a closed end lease, the risk that 

&#160;

the amount received on a sale of the leased asset will be less than the residual value is assumed by us, as lessor. While we do not have specific underwriting criteria for our lease financing, we analyze information we obtain about the lessee, including financial statements and credit reports, to determine the lessee&#8217;s ability to perform its obligations. 

&#160; 

SBA Loans . We participate in two loan programs established by the SBA: the 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program and the 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program. The 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program is designed to help small business borrowers start or expand their businesses by providing partial guarantees of loans made by banks and non-bank lending institutions for specific business purposes, including long or short term working capital; funds for the purchase of equipment, machinery, supplies and materials; funds for the purchase, construction or renovation of real estate; and funds to acquire, operate or expand an existing business or refinance existing debt, all under conditions established by the SBA. The terms of the loans must come within parameters set by the SBA, including borrower eligibility, loan maturity, and maximum loan amount. 7(a) loans must be secured by all available assets (both business and personal) until the recovery value equals the loan amount or until all assets of the borrower have been pledged. Personal guarantees are required from all owners of 20% or more of the equity of the business, although lenders may also require personal guarantees of owners of less than 20%. Loan guarantees can range to 85% of loan principal for loans of up to $150,000 and 75% for loans in excess of that amount. 

&#160; 

The SBA loan guaranty is paid to the lender after the liquidation of all collateral, mitigating the losses due to collateral deficiencies up to the percentage of the guarantee. To maintain the guarantee, we must comply with applicable SBA regulations and we risk repair or loss of the guarantee should we fail to comply. 7(a) loan amounts are not limited to a percentage of estimated collateral value and are instead based on the business &#8217;s ability to repay the loan from its cash flow . If the business generates inadequate cash flow to repay principal and interest and borrowers are otherwise unable to repay the loan, losses may result if related collateral is sold for less than the unguaranteed balance of the loan. Losses may result if related collateral is sold for less than the unguaranteed balance of the loan. Because these loans are generally at variable rates, higher rate environments will increase required payments from borrowers, with increased payment default risk. As a result of a wide variety of collateral with very specific uses, markets for resale of the collateral may be limited, which could adversely affect amounts realized upon sale. The 7(a) program is funded through annual appropriations approved by Congress matching funding requirements for loans approved within the budget year. Should those appropriations be reduced or cease, our ability to make 7(a) loans will be curtailed or terminated. 

&#160; 

The 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program is designed to provide small businesses with financing for the purchase of fixed assets, including real estate and buildings; the purchase of improvements to real estate; the construction of new facilities or modernizing, renovating or converting existing facilities; the purchase of long-term machinery and equipment &#160; and debt refinancing which the SBA currently has approved for 2016 . A 504 loan may not be used for working capital, debt refinancing or investment in rental real estate. In a 504 financing, the borrower must supply 10% of the financing amount, we provide 50% of the financing amount and a Certified Development Company, or CDC, provides 40% of the financing amount. If the borrower has less than two years of operating history or if the assets being financed are considered &#8220;special purpose,&#8221; the funding percentages are 15%, 50% and 35%, respectively. If both conditions are met the funding percentages are 25%, 50% and 30%, respectively. We receive a first lien on the assets being financed and the CDC receives a second lien. Personal guarantees of the principal owners of the business are required. The funds for the CDC loans are raised through a monthly auction of bonds that are guaranteed by the U.S. government and, accordingly, if the government guarantees are curtailed or terminated, our ability to make 504 loans would be curtailed or terminated. Certain basic loan terms, as with the 7(a) program, are established by the SBA, including borrower eligibility, maximum loan amount, maximum maturity date, interest rates and loan fees. While real estate is appraised and values are established for other collateral, and the loan amount is limited to a percentage of cost of the assets being acquired by the borrower, such amounts may not be realized upon resale if the borrower defaults and the Bank forecloses on the collateral. 

&#160; 

SBA 7(a) and 504 loans may include construction advances which are subject to risk inherent to construction projects, including environmental risks, engineering defects, contractor risk, and risk of project completion. Delays in construction may also compromise the owner&#8217;s business plan and result in additional stresses on cash flow required to service the loan. Higher than expected construction costs may also result, impacting repayment capability and collateral values. 

&#160; 

Additionally, the Bank makes SBA loans to franchisees of various business concepts, including loans to multiple franchisees with the same concept. In making loans to franchisees, the Bank considers franchisee failure rates for the specific franchise concept. However, factors adversely affecting a specific type of franchisor or franchise concept, including in particular risks that a franchise concept loses popularity with consumers or encounters negative publicity about its products or services, could harm the value not only of a particular franchisee&#8217;s business but also of multiple loans to other franchisees with the same concept. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Loans Originated for Sale into Secondary Securities Markets. We originate loans for sale into secondary securities markets. These loans are typically collateralized by various types of commercial real estate, including retail space, office space, apartments and hotels, and are with recourse only to the properties securing the loans, are not guaranteed by the borrower and, accordingly, depend on cash reserves and cash generated by the underlying properties for repayment. Some of these loans are variable rate and, as a result, higher market rates will result in higher payments and greater cash flow requirements. Inadequate sales at retail properties and inadequate occupancy rates for office space, apartments and hotels may negatively impact loan repayment. Should cash flow and available cash reserves prove inadequate to cover debt service on these loans, repayment will depend upon the sales price of the property. Because these loans are being originated for resale, the underwriting criteria used are those that buyers in the capital markets indicate are the parameters under which they are willing to buy the loans, including interest rate, loan to value ratio and maturity; however, in the period during which we hold a loan prior to sale, property values may fall below appraised values and below the outstanding balance of the loan which would reduce the price at which we could sell the loan. Inadequate retail sales or occupancy, in addition to impacting repayment, may also result in a lower realizable sales price. While we historically have been successful in selling to these markets, adverse market conditions may delay, or possibly preclude, expected sales into the secondary market or cause losses upon any resale. To mitigate these risks, we establish guidelines for the maximum amounts of such loans we will hold on our balance sheet. 

&#160; 

Affinity Banking 

Private Label Banking. For our private label banking, we create unique banking websites for each affinity group, enabling the affinity group to provide its members with the banking services and products we offer or just those banking services and products it believes will be of interest to its members. We design each website to carry the brand of the affinity group and carry the &#8220;look and feel&#8221; of the affinity group&#8217;s own website. Each such website, however, indicates that we are the provider of banking services. To facilitate the creation of these individualized banking websites, we have packaged our products and services into a series of modules, with each module providing a specific service, such as deposit products, electronic payment systems and loans. Each affinity group selects from our menu of service modules those that it wants to offer its members or customers. We and the affinity group also may create products and services, or modify products and services already on our menu, that specifically relate to the needs and interests of the affinity group&#8217;s members or customers. We pay fees to certain affinity groups based upon deposits and loans they generate. These fees vary, and certain fees increase as market interest rates increase, while other fee rates are fixed. We include these fees as a component of interest expense in calculating our net interest margin. These fees totaled $9.3 million, $7.2 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively. These amounts include fees paid related to prepaid cards, healthcare accounts, card payment processing and institutional banking which are described below. 

Prepaid Cards . We have developed prepaid card programs for general purpose re-loadable cards, insurance indemnity payments, flexible spending account funds, corporate and incentive rewards, payroll cards, consumer gift cards and others. Our cards are offered to end users through our relationships with insurers, benefits administrators, third-party administrators, corporate incentive companies, rebate fulfillment organizations, payroll administrators, large retail chains and consumer service organizations. Our cards are network-branded through our agreements with Visa, MasterCard, and Discover. The majority of fees we earn result from contractual fees paid by third party sponsors, computed on a per transaction basis, and monthly service fees. Additionally, we earn interchange fees paid through settlement associations such as Visa, which are also determined on a per transaction basis. Prepaid cards also provide us with low cost deposits from the amounts delivered to us to fund the cards. Our prepaid card programs are offered predominantly in the United States. However, we also offer our services in the Europe an Union through subsidiaries which offer prepaid card and electronic money issuing services. Our European operations contributed less than 2% of total prepaid card revenue. For information relating to current constraints on our prepaid card programs resulting from a consent order we have entered into with the FDIC, see &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-The entry into the Consent O rders, as amended, and the supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve, have imposed certain restrictions and requirements on us and the Bank.&#8221; 

Card Payment Processing . We act as the depository institution for the processing of credit and debit card payments made to various businesses. We also act as the bank sponsor and depository institution for independent service organizations that process such payments. We have designed products that enable those organizations to more easily process electronic payments and to better manage their risk of loss. Our services also enable independent service organizations to provide their members with access to their account balances through the Internet. These relationships are a source of demand deposits and fee income. 

Institutional Banking. We have developed strategic relationships with limited-purpose trust companies, registered investment advisers, broker-dealers and other firms offering institutional banking services. We provide customized, private label demand, money market and security backed loan products to the client base of these groups. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Other Operations 

&#160; 

Account Services . Account holders may access our products through the website of their affinity group or other organizational affiliate, or through our website, from any personal computer with a secure web browser, regardless of its location. This access allows account holders to apply for loans, review account activity, enter transactions into an online account register, pay bills electronically, receive statements electronically and print bank statements. 

&#160; 

Call Centers . We have call center operations that serve as inbound customer support. The call centers provide account holders or potential account holders with assistance accessing the Bank&#8217;s products and services, and in resolving any problems that may arise in the servicing of accounts or other banking products. Call Center services are operated in three locations: Domestically in Wilmington, Delaware, the Bank&#8217;s Customer Care center operates from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST Monday through Friday and handles complex calls and escalations. &#160; Transact Payments Limited (TPL) customer support is managed from our site in Sofia, Bulgaria, where support to European cardholders and program managers is provided in several European languages. In addition, two third party servicers provide &#8216;first tier&#8217; customer support. Located in Manila, Philippines, TELUS International operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week and Ubiquity Global Services operates from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. EST Monday through Friday. 

Third-Party Service Providers . To reduce operating costs and capitalize on the technical capabilities of selected vendors, we outsource certain bank operations and systems to third-party service providers, principally the following: 

&#183; 

data processing services, including check processing, check imaging, loan processing, electronic bill payment and statement rendering; 

&#183; 

fulfillment and servicing of prepaid cards; 

&#183; 

call center customer support; 

&#183; 

access to automated teller machine networks; 

&#183; 

bank accounting and general ledger system; 

&#183; 

data warehousing services; and 

&#183; 

certain software development. 

Because we outsource these operational functions to experienced third-party service providers that have the capacity to process a high volume of transactions, we believe we can more readily and cost-effectively respond to growth than if we sought to develop these capabilities internally. Should any of our current relationships terminate, we believe we could secure the required services from an alternative source without material interruption of our operations. 

European Prepaid Operations. Transact Payments Limited, or TPL, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is a prepaid product issuer (termed electronic money in Europe) organized in Gibraltar and licensed by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission or the FSC. TPL issues prepaid products throughout the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) with service and support provided by three service subsidiaries. 

Sales and Marketing 

Affinity Group Banking . Because of the national scope of our affinity group banking operation, we use a personal sales/targeted media advertising approach to market to existing and potential commercial affinity group organizations. The affinity group organizations with which we have a relationship perform marketing functions to ultimate individual customers. Our marketing program to affinity group organizations consists of: 

&#183; 

print advertising; 

&#183; 

attending and making presentations at trade shows and other events for targeted affinity organizations; 

&#183; 

direct mail; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Direct contact with potential affinity organizations by our marketing staff, with relationship managers focusing on particular regional markets. 

Loan Administration Offices. We maintain offices to market and administer our leasing programs in Crofton, Maryland, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Kent, Washington and Orlando, Florida. We maintain an SBA loan office in Chicago, Illinois. 

Technology 

&#160; 

Primary Domestic System Architecture. We provide financial products and services through a highly-secure three-tiered architecture using commercially available software. We maintain a platform of several web technologies, databases, firewalls, and licensed and proprietary financial services software to support our unique client base. User activity is distributed using load-balance technologies and our proprietary design, with internally developed software and third-party equipment. We also use third party data processors. The goal of our systems designs is to service our client requirements efficiently which has been accomplished using data and service replication between multiple data centers. The system&#8217;s flexible architecture is designed to meet current capacity needs and allow expansion for future demands. In addition to built-in redundancies, we continuously operate automated internal monitoring tools and use independent third parties to continuously monitor our systems. 

European Prepaid Card and Electronic Money Operation . European prepaid card infrastructure includes consumer servicing functions and program management. Related software includes risk management, reporting, a dynamic security system , and transaction management. 

European Prepaid System Architecture . We have a primary data center in Sofia, Bulgaria that supports our European prepaid business with a redundant network system that connects to a back-up center in London (UK). Our architecture allows for rapid expansion and flexibility. 

Domestic and European Prepaid Security . All our systems are subject to regular certification for data security standards under multiple certification requirements. 

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights 

A significant portion of the core and Internet banking systems and operations we use comes from third-party providers. Our proprietary intellectual property includes the software for creating affinity group bank websites. We rely principally upon trade secret and trademark law to protect our intellectual property. We do not typically enter into intellectual property-related confidentiality agreements with our affinity group customers because we maintain control over the software used to create the sites and their banking functions rather than licensing them for customers to use. Moreover, we believe that factors such as the relationships we develop with our affinity group and banking customers, the quality of our banking products, the level and reliability of the service we provide, and the customization of our products and services to meet the needs of our affinity groups are substantially more significant to our ability to succeed. 

Competition 

We compete with numerous banks and other financial institutions such as finance companies, leasing companies, credit unions, insurance companies, money market funds, investment firms and private lenders, as well as on-line lenders and other non-traditional competitors. Our primary competitors in each of our business lines differ significantly from those in our other business lines principally because few financial institutions compete against us in all business segments in which we operate. A number of banks and other financial institutions compete with us in the prepaid card market; however, we do not believe that any single bank or group of banks is a predominant provider . We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: 

&#183; 

our ability to expand our affinity group banking program; 

&#183; 

competitors&#8217; interest rates and service fees; 

&#183; 

the scope of our products and services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the relevance of our products and services to customer needs and the rate at which we and our competitors introduce them; 

&#183; 

satisfaction of our customers with our customer service; 

&#183; 

our perceived safety as a depository institution, including our size, credit rating, capital strength, earnings strength and regulatory posture; 

&#183; 

ease of use of our banking websites and other customer interfaces; and 

&#183; 

the capacity, reliability and security of our network infrastructure. 

&#160; 

If we experience difficulty in any of these areas, our competitive position could be materially adversely affected, which would affect our growth, our profitability and, possibly, our ability to continue operations. With respect to our affinity group operations, we believe we can compete effectively as a result of our ability to customize our product offerings to the affinity group&#8217;s needs. We believe that the costs of entry, especially compliance costs, to offering prepaid cards through affinity groups are relatively high and somewhat prohibitive to new competitors. We have competed successfully with institutions much larger than ourselves; however, many of our competitors have larger customer bases, greater name recognition, greater financial and other resources and longer operating histories which may impact our ability to compete. Our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive market. 

&#160; 

Regulation Under Banking Law 

&#160; 

Overview 

We are regulated extensively under both federal and state banking law and related regulations in the United States, and TPL is extensively regulated by the laws and related regulations of Gibraltar and of EU and EEA member countries in which it issues prepaid products. We are a Delaware corporation and a financial holding company registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve. We are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner, or the Commissioner. The Bank, as a state-chartered, nonmember depository institution, is supervised by the Commissioner, as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. TPL is a Gibraltar e-money licensee and is supervised by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission. 

The Bank is subject to requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the Bank&#8217;s operations. Any change in the regulatory requirements and policies by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Commissioner, the United States Congress, or the states in which our customers reside could have a material adverse impact on us, the Bank and our operations. We have entered into consent orders with the FDIC and have received a supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve which have imposed certain restrictions upon us and the Bank. See &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-The entry into the Consent Orders, as amended, and a supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve have imposed certain restrictions and requirements on us and the Bank.&#8221; 

Certain regulatory requirements applicable to us and the Bank are referred to below or elsewhere herein. The description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations or their effects on the Bank or us and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations. 

Federal Regulation 

As a financial holding company, we are subject to regular examination by the Federal Reserve and must file annual reports and provide any additional information that the Federal Reserve may request. Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, which we refer to as the BHCA, a financial holding company may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or merge or consolidate with another financial holding company, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. 

&#160;

Permitted Activities. The BHCA generally limits the activities of a financial holding company and its subsidiaries to that of banking, managing or controlling banks, or any other activity that is determined to be so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks that an exception is allowed for those activities. These activities include, among other things, and subject to limitations, operating a mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing data processing operations; the issuance and sale of consumer-type payment instruments; provide investment and financial advice; acting as an insurance agent for particular types of credit related insurance and providing specified securities brokerage services for customers. In November 2012, we began conducting permissible activities through TPL, an electronic money issuer organized and licensed in Gibraltar. 

Change in Control. The BHCA prohibits a company from acquiring control of a financial holding company without prior Federal Reserve approval. Similarly, the Change in Bank Control Act, which we refer to as the CBCA, prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a financial holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. In general, under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities of a financial holding company is presumed to be an acquisition of control of the holding company if: &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

the financial holding company has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

&#160; 

no other person will own or control a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the transaction. 

An acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a financial holding company is conclusively deemed to be the acquisition of control. In determining percentage ownership for a person, Federal Reserve policy is to count securities obtainable by that person through the exercise of options or warrants, even if the options or warrants have not then vested. 

The Federal Reserve has revised its minority investment policy statement, under which, subject to the filing of certain commitments with the Federal Reserve, an investor can acquire up to one-third of our equity without being deemed to have engaged in a change in control, provided that no more than 15% of the investor&#8217;s equity is voting stock. This revised policy statement also permits non-controlling passive investors to engage in interactions with our management without being considered as controlling our operations. 

Regulatory Restrictions on Dividends . It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that financial holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that financial holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the financial holding company&#8217;s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. See &#8220;Holding Company Liability,&#8221; below. Federal Reserve policies also affect the ability of a financial holding company to pay in-kind dividends. 

Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. The Bank is also subject to limitations under state law regarding the payment of dividends, including the requirement that dividends may be paid only out of net profits. See &#8220;Delaware Regulation&#8221; below. In addition to these explicit limitations, federal and state regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or financial holding company from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices. Depending upon the circumstances, the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. In August 2015, we consented to the issuance of a consent order amendment pursuant to which the payment of dividends by the Bank to us would require prior FDIC approval, and received a Federal Reserve supervisory letter pursuant to which any payment of dividends by us would require prior approval from the Federal Reserve. See &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-The entry into the Consent Orders, as amended, and a supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve have imposed certain restrictions and requirements on us and the Bank.&#8221; 

Because we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, our right to participate in the distribution of assets of the Bank, or any other subsidiary, upon the Bank&#8217;s or the subsidiary&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the Bank&#8217;s or subsidiary&#8217;s creditors. In the event of liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors and other general or subordinated creditors have priority of payment over the claims of holders of any obligation of the institution&#8217;s holding company or any of the holding company&#8217;s shareholders or creditors. 

&#160;

Holding Company Liability . Under Federal Reserve policy, a financial holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. As discussed below under &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action,&#8221; a financial holding company in certain circumstances could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary. 

In the event of a financial holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the trustee will be deemed to have assumed, and is required to cure immediately, any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution, and any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims. 

Capital Adequacy. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued standards for measuring capital adequacy for financial holding companies and banks. These standards are designed to provide risk-based capital guidelines and to incorporate a consistent framework. The risk-based guidelines are used by the agencies in their examination and supervisory process, as well as in the analysis of any applications. As discussed below under &#8220;Prompt Corrective Action,&#8221; a failure to meet minimum capital requirements could subject us or the Bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities, including, in the most severe cases, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and placing the Bank into conservatorship or receivership. 

In general, these risk-related standards require banks and financial holding companies to maintain capital based on &#8220;risk-adjusted&#8221; assets so that the categories of assets with potentially higher credit risk will require more capital backing than categories with lower credit risk. In addition, banks and financial holding companies are required to maintain capital to support off-balance sheet activities such as loan commitments. 

As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, our financial holding company status depends upon our maintaining our status as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; under applicable Federal Reserve regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these requirements, the Federal Reserve may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve may require divestiture of the holding company&#8217;s depository institution if the deficiencies persist. 

The standards classify total capital for this risk-based measure into two tiers, referred to as Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders&#8217; equity, certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less certain adjustments. Tier 2 capital consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses (within certain limits), perpetual preferred stock not included in Tier 1, hybrid capital instruments, term subordinate debt, and intermediate-term preferred stock, less certain adjustments. Together, these two categories of capital comprise a bank&#8217;s or financial holding company&#8217;s &#8220;qualifying total capital.&#8221; However, capital that qualifies as Tier 2 capital is limited in amount to 100% of Tier 1 capital in testing compliance with the total risk-based capital minimum standards. Banks and financial holding companies must have a minimum ratio of 8% of qualifying total capital to total risk-weighted assets, and a minimum ratio of 4% of qualifying Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2015, we and the Bank had total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratios of 14. 8 8 % and 14. 1 8 %, respectively, and Tier 1 capital to ris k-adjusted assets ratios of 14.6 7 % and 1 3 . 9 8 %, respectively. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have established minimum leverage ratio guidelines. The principal objective of these guidelines is to constrain the maximum degree to which a financial institution can leverage its equity capital base. It is intended to be used as a supplement to the risk-based capital guidelines. These guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets of 3% for financial holding companies that meet certain specified criteria, including those having the highest regulatory rating. Other financial institutions generally must maintain a leverage ratio of at least 3% plus 100 to 200 basis points. The guidelines also provide that financial institutions experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore, the banking agencies have indicated that they may consider other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. At December 31, 2015 we and the Bank had leverage ratios of 7.1 7 % and 6.9 0 %, respectively. 

The federal banking agencies&#8217; standards provide that concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities, as well as an institution&#8217;s ability to manage these risks, are important factors to be taken into account by them in assessing a 

&#160;

financial institution&#8217;s overall capital adequacy. The risk-based capital standards also provide for the consideration of interest rate risk in the agency&#8217;s determination of a financial institution&#8217;s capital adequacy. The standards require financial institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain capital adequate for that risk. These standards can be expected to be amended from time to time. 

The Dodd-Frank Act includes certain related provisions which are often referred to as the &#8220;Collins Amendment.&#8221; These provisions are intended to subject bank holding companies to the same capital requirements as their bank subsidiaries and to eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Under the Collins Amendment, trust preferred securities issued by a company, such as our company, with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion before May 19, 2010 and treated as regulatory capital are grandfathered, but any such securities issued later are not eligible as regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators issued final rules setting minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for holding companies and banks on a consolidated basis that are no less stringent than the generally applicable requirements in effect for depository institutions under the prompt corrective action regulations discussed below and other components of the Collins Amendment. 

&#160; 

Basel III Capital Rules 

In July 2013, the Company&#8217;s primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator, the FDIC, approved final rules, which we refer to as the New Capital Rules, establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The New Capital Rules generally implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s December 2010 final capital framework referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards. The New Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries, including us and the Bank, as compared to the current U.S. general risk-based capital rules. The New Capital Rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The New Capital Rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing general risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel Committee&#8217;s 1988 &#8220;Basel I&#8221; capital accords, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the &#8220;standardized approach&#8221; in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 &#8220;Basel II&#8221; capital accords. In addition, the New Capital Rules implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirements of Section 939A to remove references to credit ratings from the federal agencies&#8217; rules. The New Capital Rules became effective for us and the Bank on January 1, 2015, subject to phase-in periods for certain of their components and other provisions. 

&#160; 

Among other matters, the New Capital Rules: (i) introduce a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1,&#8221; or CET1 and related regulatory capital ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets; (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting certain revised requirements; (iii) mandate that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital; and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. Under the New Capital Rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to the New Capital Rules&#8217; specific requirements. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015, with the first measurement date as of March 31, 2015, are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; 

&#183; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; 

&#183; 

8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and 

&#183; 

4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The New Capital Rules also introduce a new &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221;, composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will 

&#160;

face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. Thus, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, we and the Bank will be required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5%, and (iii) Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5%. 

&#160; 

The New Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. 

&#160; 

In addition, under the current general risk-based capital rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, or AOCI, items included in shareholders&#8217; equity (for example, marks-to-market of securities held in the available for sale portfolio) under U.S. GAAP are reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Pursuant to the New Capital Rules, the effects of certain AOCI items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including us and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. This election must be made concurrently with the first filing of certain of our and the Bank&#8217;s periodic regulatory reports in the beginning of 2015. We and the Bank made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of our securities portfolio. The New Capital Rules also preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from inclusion in bank holding companies&#8217; Tier 1 capital, subject to grandfathering in the case of bank holding companies, such as us, that had less than $15 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a 4-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and increase by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

With respect to the Bank, the New Capital Rules revise the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; or PCA, regulations adopted pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The New Capital Rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category. 

&#160; 

The New Capital Rules prescribe a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset classes. 

We believe that we and the Bank will continue to be able to meet targeted capital ratios. Actual ratios are shown in the following paragraph. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions pursuant to the Prompt Corrective Action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories&#8212;&#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;&#8212;and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls. Under certain circumstances, a well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category. As we describe in Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources,&#8221; an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%. An institution is adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%. At December 31, 2015, our total risk-based capital ratio was 14. 8 8 %, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 14. 6 7 % and our leverage ratio was 7.1 7 % while the Bank&#8217;s ratios were 14. 1 8 %, 1 3.9 8 % and 6.9 0 %, respectively and, accordingly, both we and the Bank were &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; within the meaning of the regulations. A depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions (including paying dividends) or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the FDIC, and are subject to restrictions on 

&#160;

the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. 

Bank regulatory agencies are permitted or, in certain cases, required to take action with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories. Depending on the level of an institution&#8217;s capital, the agency&#8217;s corrective powers include, among other things: 

&#183; 

prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt; 

&#183; 

prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval; 

&#183; 

placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; 

&#183; 

placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates; 

&#183; 

restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; 

&#183; 

prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; and 

&#183; 

in the most severe cases, appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution. 

A banking institution that is undercapitalized must submit a capital restoration plan. This plan will not be accepted unless, among other things, the banking institution&#8217;s holding company guarantees the plan up to an agreed-upon amount. Any guarantee by a depository institution&#8217;s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy. Failure to implement a capital plan, or failure to have a capital restoration plan accepted, may result in a conservatorship or receivership. 

As noted above, the New Capital Rules became effective as of January 1, 2015, with the first measurement date as of March 31, 2015 subject to phased implementation in certain respects, and revise d the PCA regulations. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund or DIF. Upon enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 on October 3, 2008, federal deposit insurance coverage levels under the DIF temporarily increased from $100,000 to $250,000 per deposit category, per depositor, per institution, through December 31, 2009. On May 20, 2009, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act extended the temporary increase through December 31, 2012. &#160; The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per deposit category, per depositor, per institution retroactive to January 1, 2008. The Dodd-Frank Act provided unlimited deposit insurance coverage on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2012. Due to the expiration of this unlimited deposit insurance on December 31, 2012 beginning January 1, 2013 deposits held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts are aggregated with any interest-bearing deposits the owner my hold in the same ownership category, and the combined total is insured up to at least $250,000. 

As the insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against banks. 

The FDIC has implemented a risk-based assessment system under which FDIC-insured depository institutions pay annual premiums at rates based on their risk classification. A bank&#8217;s risk classification is based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the bank poses to the regulators. Institutions assigned to higher risk classifications (that is, institutions that pose a greater risk of loss to the DIF) pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk. A decrease in the Bank&#8217;s capital ratios or the occurrence of events that have an adverse effect on a bank&#8217;s asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity or sensitivity to market risk could result in a substantial increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by the Bank, which would adversely affect earnings. In addition, the FDIC can impose special assessments in certain instances. The range of assessments in the risk-based system is a function of the reserve ratio in the DIF. Each insured institution is assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. Unlike the other categories, Risk Category I contains further risk differentiation based on the FDIC&#8217;s analysis of financial ratios, examination component ratings and other information. Assessment rates are determined by the FDIC and, including potential adjustments to reflect an institution&#8217;s risk profile, currently range from five to nine basis points for the healthiest institutions (Risk Category I) to 35 basis points of assessable liabilities for the riskiest (Risk Category IV). Rates may be increased an additional ten basis points depending on the amount of brokered deposits utilized. The above rates apply to institutions with assets 

&#160;

under $10 billion. Other rates apply for larger or &#8220;highly complex&#8221; institutions. The FDIC may adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next, except that no single adjustment can exceed three basis points. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s DIF assessment rate was 2 4 basis points. A reduction in the assessment rate will depend on future FDIC evaluations of the Bank. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits of the total industry. &#160; The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC proposed rules in October 2015 regarding the offset. &#160; Under the proposal, banks with less than $10 billion in assets would receive an assessment credit for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase from 1.15% to 1.35%. &#160; These rules have not yet been finalized. 

Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if such loan is secured by specified collateral, generally readily marketable collateral (which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion) and real estate. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s limit on loans-to-one borrower was $46.7 million ($77.8 million for secured loans). 

Transactions with Affiliates and other Related Parties. There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which a financial holding company and its nonbank subsidiaries can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from banking subsidiaries or engage in other transactions with or involving those banking subsidiaries. The Bank&#8217;s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or &#8220;affiliates&#8221; (that is, any entity that controls, controlled by or is under common control with an institution, including us and our non-bank subsidiaries) is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W promulgated thereunder. Section 23A restricts the aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. At December 31, 2015, we were not indebted to the Bank. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in Section 23A and the purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Section 23B generally provides that certain transactions with affiliates, including loans and asset purchases, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivatives transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain assets sales to and from an insider to an institution including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution&#8217;s board of directors. 

The Bank&#8217;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank&#8217;s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank&#8217;s board of directors. At December 31, 2015, loans to related parties amounted to $1.8 million and at December 31, 2014 such loans amounted to $30.9 million. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires each federal banking agency to prescribe for all insured depository institutions standards relating to, among other things, internal controls, information and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees, benefits and such other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement these safety and soundness standards. The 

&#160;

guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 

Privacy. Financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Customers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing nonpublic personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except under narrow circumstances, such as the processing of transactions requested by the consumer or when the financial institution is jointly sponsoring a product or service with a nonaffiliated third party. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing to consumers. The Bank has adopted privacy standards that we believe will satisfy regulatory scrutiny , and communicates its privacy practices to its customers through privacy disclosures designed in a manner consistent with recommended model forms. 

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, known as the FACT Act, provides consumers with the ability to restrict companies from using certain information obtained from affiliates to make marketing solicitations. In general, a person is prohibited from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and had a reasonable opportunity to opt out of such solicitations. The rule permits opt-out notices to be given by any affiliate that has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and permits a joint notice from two or more affiliates. Moreover, such notice would not be applicable if the company using the information has a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer. This notice may be combined with other required disclosures, including notices required under other applicable privacy provisions. 

&#160; 

Section 315 of the FACT Act requires each financial institution or creditor to develop and implement a written Identity Theft Prevention Program to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. In accordance with this rule, the Bank was required to adopt &#8220;reasonable policies and procedures&#8221; to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

identify relevant red flags for covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 

&#183; 

detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 

&#183; 

respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 

&#183; 

ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial institution or creditor from identity theft. 

Bank Secrecy Act- Anti-Money Laundering and Related Regulations. The Bank Secrecy Act, which we refer to as BSA, requires the Bank to implement a risk-based compliance program in order to protect the Bank from being used as a conduit for financial or other illicit crimes including but not limited to money laundering and terrorist financing. These rules are administered by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, which we refer to as FinCEN. Under the law, the Bank must have a board-approved written BSA-Anti-Money Laundering, which we refer to as AML, program which must contain the following key requirements: (1) appointing responsible persons to manage the program, including a BSA Officer; (2) ongoing training of all appropriate Bank staff and management on BSA-AML compliance; (3) developing a system of internal controls (including appropriate policies, procedures and processes); and (4) requiring independent testing to ensure effective implementation of the program and appropriate compliance. Under BSA regulations, the Bank is subject to various reporting requirements such as currency transaction reporting (CTR) for all cash transactions initiated by or on behalf of a customer which, when aggregated, exceed $10,000 per day. The Bank is also required to monitor customer activity and transactions and file a suspicious activity report, or SAR, when suspicious activity is observed and the applicable dollar threshold for the observed suspicious activity is met. The BSA also contains numerous recordkeeping requirements. For a description of a consent order with the FDIC under the BSA that imposes certain requirements on the Bank, see Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Recent Developments&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-The entry into the Consent Orders, as amended, and a supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve have imposed certain restrictions and requirements on us and the Bank.&#8221; 

On June 21, 2010, FinCEN proposed new rules as directed by the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 to expand the reach of BSA-AML related compliance responsibilities to certain defined &#8220;prepaid access providers and sellers, a class of money services businesses formerly either outside or lightly regulated under the BSA.&#8221; On July 26, 2011, FinCEN issued its final rule imposing these affirmative BSA-AML compliance obligations. The Bank has evaluated the impact of these rules on its operations and its third-party relationships, and has established internal processes accordingly. 

&#160;

USA PATRIOT Act. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, which we refer to as the USA PATRIOT Act, amended, in part, the BSA, by, in pertinent part, criminalizing the financing of terrorism and augmenting the existing BSA framework by strengthening customer identification procedures, requiring financial institutions to have due diligence procedures, including enhanced due diligence procedures and, most significantly, improving information sharing between financial institutions and the U.S. government. 

Under the USA PATRIOT Act, FinCEN can send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities or money laundering. The Bank must search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must report specific information to FinCEN and implement other internal compliance procedures in accordance with the Bank&#8217;s BSA-AML compliance procedures. 

The Office of Foreign Assets Control, which we refer to as OFAC, is a division of the U.S. Treasury Department, and administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, and those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. OFAC functions under the President&#8217;s wartime and national emergency powers, as well as under authority granted by specific legislation, to impose controls on transactions and freeze assets under U.S. jurisdiction. In addition, many of the sanctions are based on United Nations and other international mandates, and typically involve close cooperation with allied governments. OFAC maintains lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, as well as sanctions programs for certain countries. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Bank must freeze or block such account, and perform additional procedures as required by OFAC regulations. The Bank filters its customer base and transactional activity against OFAC-issued lists. The Bank performs these checks utilizing purpose directed software, which is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies. 

Other Consumer Protection Regulations. The Bank is subject to a wide range of consumer protection regulations which may have an enterprise-wide impact or may principally govern its lending or deposit operations. To the extent the Bank engages third party service providers in any aspect of its products and services, these third parties may also be subject to compliance with applicable law, and must therefore be subject to Bank oversight. 

Unfair or Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices. Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits all persons, including financial institutions, from engaging in any unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. The Dodd-Frank Act codifies this prohibition, and expands it even further by prohibiting &#8220;abusive&#8221; practices as well. These prohibitions, which we refer to as UDAAP, apply in all areas of the Bank, including marketing and advertising practices, product features, terms and conditions, operational practices, and the conduct of third parties with whom the Bank may partner or on whom the Bank may rely in bringing Bank products and services to consumers. 

The Bank&#8217;s loan operations are also subject to federal consumer protection laws applicable to credit transactions, including: 

&#183; 

the federal &#8220;Truth-In-Lending Act,&#8221; governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975,&#8221; requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Equal Credit Opportunity Act,&#8221; prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978,&#8221; as amended by the &#8220;Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act,&#8221; governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies, certain identity theft protections and certain credit and other disclosures; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,&#8221; governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act&#8221; prohibiting unfair, abusive or deceptive home mortgage lending practices, restricting mortgage lending activities and providing advertising and mortgage disclosure standards. 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Service Members Civil Relief Act;&#8221; postponing or suspending some civil obligations of service members during periods of transition, deployment and other times; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws; 

&#160; 

In addition, interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank will be subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. 

&#160; 

The deposit operations of the Bank are subject to various consumer protection laws including but not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Truth in Savings Act,&#8221; which imposes disclosure obligations to enable consumers to make informed decisions about accounts at depository institutions; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Right to Financial Privacy Act,&#8221; which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Expedited Funds Availability Act&#8221; which establishes standards related to when financial institutions must make various deposit items available for withdrawal, and requires depository institutions to disclose their availability policies to their depositors; 

&#183; 

the &#8220;Electronic Fund Transfer Act&#8221; and which governs electronic fund transfers to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and 

&#183; 

the rules and regulations of various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which we refer to as the CRA, a federally-insured institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its community, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. The B ank shall delineate one or more assessment areas within which the FDIC evaluates the bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community. The CRA further requires that a record be kept of whether a financial institution meets its community&#8217;s credit needs, which record will be taken into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches and mergers and acquisitions. The CRA further requires that a record be kept of whether a financial institution meets its community&#8217;s credit needs, which record will be taken into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches and mergers and acquisitions. The regulations promulgated pursuant to the CRA contain three evaluation tests: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a lending test evaluates a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) through its lending activities by considering a bank's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and community development lending. ; 

&#183; 

a service test, evaluates a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) by analyzing both the availability and effectiveness of a bank's systems for delivering retail banking services and the extent and innovativeness of its community development services ; and 

&#183; 

an investment test, evaluates a bank's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area(s) through qualified investments that benefit its assessment area(s) or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank's assessment area(s). 

&#160; 

The Bank was examined for CRA compliance in 2015 and received a &#8220;needs to improve&#8221; rating for the 2015 examination which covered the period from 2012 through June 2, 2015. As a result of the current rating, certain business restrictions are in place, including FDIC limits on change in control, new branches, branch relocation, main office relocation, and mergers (regular, interim or corporate reorganizations). The Federal Reserve Bank restrictions include limitations on holding company commencement of direct or indirect new financial activity and holding company change in control. &#160; The Federal Housing Finance Agency has also imposed restrictions on receiving long-term advances and participating in their Affordable Housing Program and Community Investment Cash Advances Program. 

Given the nature of the private label branchless banking services the Bank offers, during the course of the examination the Bank elected to develop a CRA Strategic Plan to meet its regulatory requirements. Once the CRA Strategic Plan is approved, the Bank will operate under approved customized regulatory standards it believes will provide improved opportunities for performance. The Bank continues to closely monitor its performance in alignment with the CRA Strategic Plan to meet with lending, service and investment requirements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Enforcement. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the FDIC has the authority to bring actions against a bank and all affiliated parties, including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants, who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on the bank. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to institution of receivership or conservatorship proceedings, or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations. 

&#160; 

Federal Reserve System. Federal Reserve regulations require banks to maintain non-interest bearing reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily negotiated order of withdrawal, or NOW, and regular checking accounts). For 2015, Federal Reserve regulations generally required that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: for accounts aggregating $89.1 million or less (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve), the reserve requirement is 3%; and, for accounts aggregating greater than $89.1 million, the reserve requirement is 10% (subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve to between 8% and 14%). The first $14.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve) are exempt from the reserve requirements. At December 31, 2015, the Bank met these requirements by maintaining $266.8 million in cash and balances at the Federal Reserve Bank. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Reform 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act (as amended) implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things, will or have already: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, with broad rulemaking, supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and certain others, including the examination and enforcement powers with respect to any bank with more than $10 billion in assets. The CFPB has been officially established and has begun issuing rules, taking consumer complaints and performing its other core functions. 

&#183; 

Restrict the preemption of state consumer financial protection law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks, from availing themselves of such preemption. 

&#183; 

Require new capital rules and apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies. 

&#183; 

Require publicly-traded bank holding companies with assets of $10 billion or more to establish a risk committee responsible for enterprise-wide risk management practices. 

&#183; 

Change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated average assets less tangible capital. 

&#183; 

Increase the minimum ratio of net worth to insured deposits of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% and require the FDIC, in setting assessments, to offset the effect of the increase on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. 

&#183; 

Provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance, including guidelines or regulations on incentive-based compensation and a prohibition on compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks or that could provide excessive compensation. 

&#183; 

Make permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until January 1, 2013 for non-interest bearing demand transaction accounts and IOLTA accounts at all insured depository institutions. 

&#183; 

Repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. 

&#183; 

Allow de novo interstate branching by banks. 

&#183; 

Give the Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer. The Federal Reserve has issued final rules under this provision that limit the swipe fees that a debit card issuer can charge merchants to 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction value, subject to an adjustment for fraud prevention costs. 

&#183; 

Increase the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine the holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Require all bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their depository institution subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries suffer from financial distress. 

&#183; 

Restrict proprietary trading by banks, bank holding companies and others, and their acquisition and retention of ownership interests in and sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds. This restriction is commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; There is an exception in the Volcker Rule to allow a bank to organize and offer hedge funds and private equity funds to customers if certain conditions are met. These conditions include, among others, requirements that the bank provides bona fide investment advisory services; the funds are organized only in connection with such services and to customers of such services; the bank does not have more than a de minimis interest in the funds, limited to a 3% ownership interest in any single fund and an aggregated investment in all funds of 3% of Tier 1 capital; the bank does not guarantee the obligations or performance of the funds; and no director or employee of the bank has an ownership interest in the fund unless he or she provides services directly to the funds. 

&#160; 

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years. Specific rulemaking intended to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is underway and is addressed elsewhere in this section as applicable. It is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting regulations may impact us. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may increase our costs, limit our ability to pursue attractive business opportunities, cause us to modify our strategies and business operations and increase our capital requirements and constraints, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule Adoption . On December 10, 2013, five financial regulatory agencies, including our primary federal regulators the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, adopted final rules (the &#8220;Final Volcker Rules&#8221;) implementing the Volcker Rule embodied in Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, which was added by Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Final Volcker Rules prohibit banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds (&#8220;covered funds&#8221;). The Final Volcker Rules also require each regulated entity to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Final Volcker Rules, which must include (for the largest entities) making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Smaller banks and community banks, including the Bank, are afforded some relief under the Final Volcker Rules. Smaller banks, including the Bank, that are engaged only in exempted proprietary trading, such as trading in U.S. government, agency, state and municipal obligations, are exempt from compliance program requirements. Moreover, even if a community or small bank engages in proprietary trading or covered fund activities under the Final Volcker Rules, they need only incorporate references to the Volcker Rule into their existing policies and procedures. The Final Rules became effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period was extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 until July 21, 2016. We do not at this time expect the Final Volcker Rules to have a material impact on our operations. &#160; 

&#160; 

Prepaid Rules Proposed by the CFPB. On December 23, 2014, the CFPB published a proposed rule that would regulate prepaid products, including physical cards as well as codes and other devices. The proposed rule would, among other things, cause prepaid products to be fully-covered by Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and to be covered by Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act, to the extent the prepaid product accesses a &#8220;credit&#8221; feature. 

&#160; 

The proposed rule and related commentary is over 230 pages in length and provides significant discussion, materials and commentary that we are currently assessing. The proposed rule includes a significant number of changes to the regulatory framework for prepaid products, some of which include: (a) establishing a definition of &#8220;prepaid account&#8221; within Regulation E that includes reloadable and non-reloadable physical cards, as well as codes or other devices, and focuses on how the product is issued and used; (b) modifying Regulation E to require that short form and long form disclosures be provided to a consumer prior to a consumer agreeing to acquire a prepaid account with certain exceptions and with specified forms that, if used, would provide a safe harbor for financial institutions; (c) extending to prepaid accounts the periodic transaction history and statement requirements of Regulation E currently applicable to payroll and Federal government benefit accounts; (d) extending the error resolution and limited liability provisions of Regulation E currently applicable to payroll cards to registered network branded prepaid cards; (e) requiring financial institutions to post prepaid account agreements to the issuers&#8217; websites and to submit them to the CFPB; (f) extending Regulation Z&#8217;s credit card rules and disclosure requirements to prepaid accounts that provide overdraft protection and other credit features; (g) requiring an issuer to obtain a prepaid account holder&#8217;s consent prior to adding overdraft services or other credit features and prohibiting the issuer from adding overdraft services or other credit features for at least 30 calendar days after a consumer registers the prepaid account; (h) prohibiting the application of different terms and conditions, such as charging different fees, to a prepaid account depending on whether the consumer elects to link the prepaid account to overdraft services or other credit features. 

&#160;

&#160; 

As of the date of this filing, it is not clear if the CFPB will adopt the proposed rule in whole or in part, or with modifications, and there is no known timeframe for the CFPB taking further action on the proposed rule. 

&#160; 

&#160; Consumer Protections for Remittance Transfers . On February 7, 2012, the CFPB published a final rule to implement Section 1073 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule creates a comprehensive set of consumer protections for remittance transfers sent by consumers in the United States to parties in foreign countries. The final rule, among other things, mandates certain disclosures and consumer cancellation rights for foreign remittances covered by the rule. 

&#160; 

Federal Regulatory Guidance on Incentive Compensation. On June 21, 2010, federal banking regulators released final guidance on sound incentive compensation policies for banking organizations. This guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group, is based upon key principles including: (1) incentive compensation arrangements at a banking organization should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (2) these arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and (3) these arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. The final guidance seeks to address the safety and soundness risks of incentive compensation practices to ultimately be sure that compensation practices are not structured in a manner to give employees incentives to take imprudent risks. Federal regulators intend to actively monitor the actions being taken by banking organizations with respect to incentive compensation arrangements and will review and update their guidance as appropriate to incorporate best practices that emerge. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as ours that are not considered &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management controls or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

&#160; 

In February 2011, the Federal Reserve, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC approved a joint proposed rulemaking to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions and that are deemed to be excessive, or that may lead to material losses. 

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies. The commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by both U.S. fiscal policy and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Some of the instruments of fiscal and monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve include changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, the fluctuating availability of borrowings at the &#8220;discount window,&#8221; open market operations, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks&#8217; deposits and assets of foreign branches, the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates, and the placing of limits on interest rates that member banks may pay on time and savings deposits. Such policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits (see &#8220;Item 7 Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;). We cannot predict the nature of future fiscal and monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the future business and our earnings. 

Delaware Regulation 

&#160; 

General. As a Delaware financial holding company, we are subject to the supervision of and periodic examination by the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner and must comply with the reporting requirements of the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner. The Bank, as a banking corporation chartered under Delaware law, is subject to comprehensive regulation by the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner, including regulation of the conduct of its internal affairs, the extent and exercise of its banking powers, the issuance of capital notes or debentures, any mergers, consolidations or conversions, its lending and investment practices and its revolving and closed-end credit practices. The Bank also is subject to periodic examination by the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner and must comply with the reporting requirements of the Delaware Office of the 

&#160;

State Bank Commissioner. The Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner has the power to issue cease and desist orders prohibiting unsafe and unsound practices in the conduct of a banking business. 

&#160; 

Limitation on Dividends. Under Delaware banking law, the Bank&#8217;s directors may declare dividends on common or preferred stock of so much of its net profits as they judge expedient; but the Bank must, before the declaration of a dividend on common stock from net profits, carry 50% of its net profits of the preceding period for which the dividend is paid to its surplus fund until its surplus fund amounts to 50% of its capital stock and thereafter must carry 25% of its net profits for the preceding period for which the dividend is paid to its surplus fund until its surplus fund amounts to 100% of its capital stock. The Bank&#8217;s payment of dividends is also governed by federal banking laws and regulations promulgated by the FDIC, and by an amendment to the 2014 Consent Order with the FDIC which provides that any payment of dividends by the Bank must receive prior approval from the FDIC. 

&#160; 

Gibraltar &#160; and European Union Regulation 

&#160; 

TPL, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is an electronic money issuer organized in Gibraltar and licensed by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission or the FSC. As a licensed e-money issuer operating in Gibraltar and in other countries in the EU and EEA, TPL is subject to the laws and regulations of Gibraltar and any EU or EEA countries in which it does or may operate. TPL is subject to supervision and regulation by the FSC. As TPL&#8217;s primary regulator, the FSC conducts regular examinations of TPL and TPL must file annual and other periodic reports. 

&#160; 

Laws applicable to TPL include, without limitation, the Financial Services (Electronic Money) Regulations of 2011, which we refer to as the E-Money Regulations, promulgated by the FSC and the Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC). In January 2012, the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the Data Protection Directive. As of December 31, 2015, the proposed rules had not been passed by the European Parliament. The E-Money Regulations impose upon TPL substantive rules governing TPL&#8217;s operation of e-money services, including rules requiring TPL to maintain certain minimum capital levels, governing the safeguarding of cardholder funds, and penalties for any violations. Any change in the laws, regulations and policies of the Gibraltar Parliament, the European Union, its member countries, or any other country in which TPL operates, could have a material adverse impact on TPL and its operations. 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 762 full-time employees and believe our relationships with our employees to be good. Our employees are not employed under a collective bargaining agreement. &#160;
