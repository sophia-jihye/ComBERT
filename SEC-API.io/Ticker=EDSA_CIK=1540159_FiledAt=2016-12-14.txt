 Item 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

Stellar Biotechnologies, Inc. is a biotechnology company engaged in the aquaculture, research and development, manufacture and commercialization of Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH). KLH is an immune-stimulating protein with an extensive history of safe and effective use in immunological applications.

&#160;

KLH can be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and combined with a disease-targeting agent to create immunotherapies for the treatment of a variety of diseases. The protein is currently being utilized in active immunotherapies in clinical development for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, metastatic breast cancer, Crohn&#8217;s disease, systemic lupus erythematous, ovarian cancer and various other cancers and diseases. The KLH protein can also be used as a finished, injectable product in the immunodiagnostic market for measuring immune response in patients and research settings. Immunotherapies (also known as therapeutic vaccines) involve using the body&#8217;s own immune system to target and treat disease. Immunodiagnostics involve assessing the body&#8217;s immune status in relation to the effects of a new drug, a disease, or the environment. Our KLH products can be used to stimulate the immune system in both applications.

&#160;

We extract and manufacture KLH from the hemolymph (a fluid equivalent to blood) of a relatively scarce ocean mollusk, the Giant Keyhole Limpet. Based upon our specialized knowledge of aquaculture science and KLH, we have built unique land-based aquaculture, laboratory and production facilities in Port Hueneme, California, and developed sustainable and scalable manufacturing processes to produce KLH using Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP or GMP).

&#160;

We market and sell GMP grade and research grade KLH products to third parties under the brand Stellar KLH&#8482;. Our customers and partners include multinational biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, clinical research organizations, and research centers. We believe we are positioning our business to meet the anticipated long-term demand within the pharmaceutical industry for GMP grade KLH by providing a sustainable source for its scalable, controlled, and traceable production. The versatility of the KLH molecule and the growing need for commercial-scale GMP grade KLH provide multiple commercial opportunities for us.

&#160;

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that we possess a number of competitive strengths that position us to become the world leader in the sustainable manufacture of GMP grade KLH and KLH-conjugated vaccines , including: 

&#160; 

&#183; Mature, land-based aquaculture facility produces a barrier to market entry. Using our proprietary methods and achievements in aquaculture science, we can support the source animal for KLH from embryo to protein-producing adult, and we now support multiple generations of limpets grown entirely within our land-based aquaculture facility. Other KLH suppliers do not have this capability and thus are reliant on scarce, wild populations. Due to the time needed to raise the source animal to maturity, and the time needed to build and validate facilities and manufacturing processes, we believe that we have a five to seven year lead over any new market entrants attempting to produce KLH in a similar manner. Due to its exceptional size and complexity, KLH has not been reproduced synthetically. &#160; 

&#183; Fully traceable, GMP grade product offerings benefit commercialization programs. Using our proprietary production and manufacturing methods, we are able to produce a high quality, GMP grade KLH product that is fully traceable and controlled from native source to finished product, which we believe are important considerations for our pharmaceutical partners as they pursue later-stage trials and commercial introductions subject to more rigorous regulatory standards than early-stage research. Due to the known origin of material and continuity of data, we believe we are able to create a more consistent, high quality, immunogenic product than other KLH proteins in the market. In contrast, commercial supplies of KLH from other sources have historically differed widely in their source, traceability, purity, form and preparation, as well as their immunogenicity (their ability to stimulate an immune response). We believe that we are the only company that offers GMP grade KLH supported by fully traceable manufacturing methods. &#160;

&#160; Page 4 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Multiple supply and collaboration agreements reduce single-customer dependence. We believe that our supply and collaboration agreements with drug developers, which include binding orders, allow us to better manage our working capital as well as build long-term relationships. Our manufacturing and quality experts work closely with our collaboration partners and customers to deliver KLH products according to their specifications. We believe that our record for reliably providing high quality KLH has created customer trust and loyalty. &#160; 

&#183; Business model leverages growth potential. We believe we have an attractive business model due to the unique nature of our product offerings, embedded growth opportunities within our existing customer base and operating leverage. As we increase production volumes and sales, we expect our operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue, providing for greater operating leverage. In addition, we have established a model via our joint venture, Neostell, S.A.S., to participate in the manufacturing of KLH-conjugated vaccines, which provides additional revenue and growth opportunities. &#160;

&#183; Intellectual property portfolio includes protection for specialized systems and technologies. We have intellectual property related to KLH development and manufacturing and to the environmental protection of the Giant Keyhole Limpet, including patents, trade secrets and know-how related to specialized aquaculture systems and technologies; spawning, selection and maintenance of the species; non-lethal KLH protein extraction methods; and the processing, purification and production of KLH formulations. &#160;

&#183; Sustainability practices protect marine source and promote scalability. Our KLH protein is produced using environmentally sound, sustainable practices intended to protect and renew the live marine source. We believe this is a critical component of ensuring long-term, scalable supplies, since rapid growth in demand has had severe consequences to other related species. In California, for example, failure to manage wild populations of abalone resulted in dramatic declines and eventually led to closure of commercial abalone harvests. &#160;

&#183; Leadership team provides extensive aquaculture production and related industry expertise. Our leadership team includes industry experts who have extensive experience in the field of aquaculture and Giant Keyhole Limpet production, and possess a deep understanding of a variety of biotechnology businesses. Our President and CEO has more than 40 years of experience leading commercial aquaculture businesses and projects focused on mollusk domestication and production. &#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160;

We plan to use our proprietary methods and intellectual property to serve the growing demand for KLH in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics applications. Key elements of our business strategy include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Expand infrastructure and capacity while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We plan to incrementally increase our infrastructure, manufacturing capabilities and KLH production capacity based on our customers&#8217; forecasts and the anticipated future requirements of commercial-scale vaccine manufacturing, which we estimate could require multiple kilograms of GMP grade KLH per year. In order to produce such volumes and to provide our customers with greater certainty of future supply, we intend to have the capacity to support commercial drug launches in a variety of indications, with planned redundancy at multiple locations. We believe we can scale up capacity to meet anticipated customer demand for the next one to two years with current resources. 

&#160;

&#183; Pursue additional supply and collaboration agreements. We plan to continue pursuing opportunities for commercial growth that build on our strengths and core competencies in KLH development and manufacturing, including additional supply and collaboration agreements. We regularly engage in discussions with various entities involved in immunotherapies, in connection with opportunities for licensing, supply and collaborative research. &#160; 

&#160; Page 5 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; Support continuing development of our Neostell Growth Initiative. In July 2016, we formed Neostell S.A.S., a joint venture with Neovacs S.A, to produce Neovacs&#8217; Kinoid immunotherapy product candidates which utilize Stellar KLH&#8482; as a carrier molecule. In addition to expanding our market opportunities related to manufacturing of Neovacs&#8217; KLH-conjugated vaccines, this joint venture provides the opportunity to manufacture and sell KLH-based immunotherapies for third party customers. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Continue innovation and new product development. We plan to expand our KLH technology portfolio through ongoing research and development. Our research and development (R&#38;D) activities are focused primarily on the aquaculture of the Giant Keyhole Limpet; improvements in KLH protein analysis and manufacturing; the development of functional assays; and new uses for KLH in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostic applications. We believe that these activities provide long-term strategic, revenue and clinical opportunities by extending the commercial use of Stellar KLH&#8482; and furthering our understanding of the KLH molecule. &#160; 

Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) 

&#160;

KLH is a safe, potent, immune-stimulating protein. Specifically, it is a very large, high molecular weight, oxygen-carrying glycoprotein made of millions of atoms. In addition to the native molecule, KLH can be chemically dissociated into a subunit formulation commonly used in the production of immunotherapies. Both the native, high molecular weight molecule and subunit forms of KLH are excellent immune stimulants. The KLH molecular structure offers numerous sites for conjugation, and can generate multiple product configurations. Because of its large size, immune-stimulating properties, numerous sites for conjugation, and safety profile, KLH is used by researchers and product developers as a vaccine carrier protein. However, due to its exceptional size and complexity, KLH has not been reproduced synthetically.

&#160;

KLH can be used as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, or it can be used as a finished, injectable product in the immunodiagnostic market.

&#160;

As an active pharmaceutical ingredient, KLH is an effective and safe carrier molecule for conjugation to vaccine antigens that are used to promote the generation of antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against targeted diseases. By themselves, the small haptens (partial antigens) and vaccine antigens used to target these diseases are not usually immunogenic enough to awaken the immune system and therefore, require a carrier molecule or adjuvant, like KLH, in order to be effective. The combination of an antigen against specific pathogenic targets, such as tumors, and over-expressed proteins, conjugated to the immunogenic KLH molecule, is the basis for a promising new class of drugs in development known as active immunotherapies or therapeutic vaccines. Unlike preventative vaccines, active immunotherapies are designed to stimulate the body&#8217;s own immune system to generate an immune response to target and attack an existing disease or condition. We believe immunotherapies are, and will continue to be, one of the fastest-growing sectors of pharmaceutical research and development. KLH is an important component for drugs used in clinical development, including major indications such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, metastatic breast cancer, Crohn&#8217;s disease, systemic lupus erythematous, ovarian cancer and various other cancers and diseases. New indications entering clinical trials, such as dermatomyositis, point to expanding clinical potential for KLH.

&#160;

As a finished injectable product, KLH has been used extensively by pharmaceutical companies and researchers as a safe, immune-stimulating antigen in drug-screening, drug immunotoxicology, and assessment of immune status. KLH is a standard immunogen in T-Cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR), a functional assay which is widely recognized as a standard test for monitoring the effects of drugs on the immune system.

&#160;

KLH protein is derived only from the hemolymph of the Giant Keyhole Limpet ( Megathura crenulata ), a mollusk native only to a limited stretch of the Pacific Ocean coastline along Southern California and Baja California, Mexico. Historically, suppliers other than us have obtained KLH protein directly from wild and sensitive populations of Giant Keyhole Limpet, or have utilized lethal production processes. Based on publicly available information and reports, commercial supplies of KLH differ widely in their source, traceability, purity, form, and preparation, as well as in immunogenicity (their ability to stimulate an immune response). We believe that highly-specialized aquaculture manufacturing methods, like the methods we practice, protect the KLH molecule&#8217;s source species and provide sustainable, scalable supplies of quality KLH protein. The concept of sustainability involves sound, responsible management of environmental resources and, especially where biological systems are concerned, includes protecting native species so that the species thrive and remain diverse and productive over time. Further, we believe that environmentally sound methods associated with professional and specialized aquaculture can minimize variability in KLH products and assure full traceability to their biological source.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Technology 

&#160;

We have committed over 15 years to the advancement of aquaculture science and sustainable KLH production methods, specifically focused on protection of the Giant Keyhole Limpet and the non-lethal extraction of KLH protein. We believe our proprietary methods will provide a sustainable supply of GMP grade KLH and meet pharmaceutical industry standards for immune response, consistency, purity, and traceability while protecting the natural source species.

&#160;

Our Aquaculture Technology &#38; Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Our proprietary aquaculture technology involves methods we developed and optimized to control the reproduction and growth of the Giant Keyhole Limpet including, but not limited to, culture systems, nutritional requirements, and the recirculation of seawater. We achieved a significant milestone in aquaculture science by developing the capability to sustain the complete life cycle of the Giant Keyhole Limpet. Using our proprietary methods, we can support the marine mollusk from embryo to protein-producing adult, and we now support multiple generations of limpets grown entirely within our land-based aquaculture facility. Other KLH suppliers do not have this capability and thus are reliant on scarce, wild populations of limpets.

&#160;

The aquaculture cycle to raise Giant Keyhole Limpets from fertilized eggs to maturity for KLH production is approximately five years, with multiple complex larval and juvenile stages. KLH can be extracted from mature limpets a limited number of times per year and, if properly maintained, the average extracted quantity of KLH per year per limpet is predictable and useful in estimating targets for production planning and optimizing the use of the hemolymph. The hemolymph is extracted in a non-lethal manner utilizing our patented methods. Once extracted, the hemolymph is processed through our proprietary methods, which are protected as trade secrets.

&#160;

We currently maintain a production inventory of limpets sufficient for an annual capacity of 1,500 grams/year of KLH pharmaceutical intermediate, which can be further processed and purified to produce various final product grades and formulations. Given current resources, we believe we can scale up capacity to meet anticipated customer demand for the next one to two years. Given sufficient funding to continue scale-up, our projected production capacity is up to 20,000 grams (20 kg) of KLH pharmaceutical intermediate in five to seven years. We plan to incrementally increase hatchery production of limpets and expand aquaculture infrastructure, which will thereby increase our KLH production capacity, in order to meet the anticipated future multi-kilogram KLH requirements of immunotherapy commercialization.

&#160;

We contract with contract manufacturing organizations and contract testing organizations for certain steps of cGMP processing and quality control testing. The services currently performed by these contract vendors include sterile fill/finish and release testing.

&#160;

As a result of these operational capabilities, we believe we will be able to supply GMP grade KLH in commercial quantities to meet the anticipated long-term demand within the pharmaceutical industry, while protecting the natural source species. We base these beliefs on our intellectual property, achievements in aquaculture science, KLH production capacity, KLH sustainable manufacturing know-how, and survey data used to estimate population of Giant Keyhole Limpets in the wild.

&#160;

Our Facilities 

&#160;

We maintain research and manufacturing facilities directly along the Pacific Ocean with dedicated, land-based aquaculture operations in Port Hueneme, California. We have approximately 37,000 square feet of leased aquaculture, manufacturing, and laboratory space. We believe our waterfront location is a proprietary asset that allows our marine scientists to work in close proximity to naturally resident Giant Keyhole Limpet colonies, and to be at the forefront in developing protective measures and environmentally sound practices for KLH production.

&#160;

&#160; Page 7 

&#160;

&#160;

Our aquaculture operations were specially developed in the late 1990s for production and research on gastropod mollusks, have been in near continuous operation since that time, and have since been expanded significantly by us for the specialized purpose of conducting the intensive steps required to support the complete life cycle of the Giant Keyhole Limpet and for the commercial production of KLH protein. Our aquaculture facility includes, among other specialized infrastructure, systems for spawning, larval development, and maturation of limpets, a fully permitted seawater supply system, recirculating seawater supply systems, environmental controls and regulated seawater return to the ocean. Our facility currently includes multiple production tanks and numerous individual limpet production modules in two independent aquaculture production systems. Each closed recirculating system is equipped with temperature controlled seawater distribution, filtration and treatment equipment. The facility also contains a fabrication shop for production of equipment and culture apparatus.

&#160;

In July 2015, we entered into an exclusive collaboration agreement with Ostiones Guerrero, SA de CV to secure a unique strategic site in Baja California, Mexico, for the potential development of an additional aquaculture locale and future expansion of our KLH production. The collaboration with Ostiones is intended to include design, expansion and development of marine aquaculture resources for hatchery and maturation of Giant Keyhole Limpets. In connection with the collaboration agreement, we also entered into a lease agreement with Ostiones for undeveloped land on which suitability studies are to be conducted by Stellar over the next two years. We believe this expansion will support our goal to meet the anticipated long-term industry demand for KLH protein.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We are committed to applying our proprietary Stellar KLH&#8482; technology to improve immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics, and to protecting the natural resource for KLH. To that end, we are actively engaged in research and development focused primarily on the aquaculture of the Giant Keyhole Limpet; improvements in KLH protein analysis and manufacturing; the development of functional assays; and new uses for KLH in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostic applications. These activities involve both internal programs and external collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies or research organizations.

&#160;

Our internal research has included, among other activities, improvement of methods for the culture and growth of Giant Keyhole Limpet, innovations in aquaculture systems and infrastructure, biophysical and biochemical characterization of the KLH molecule, analytical processes to enhance performance of our products, KLH manufacturing process improvements, new KLH formulations and KLH-related technologies, and early development of potential new KLH-based immunotherapy.

&#160;

Our external collaborations involve both development and evaluation projects, with multiple biopharmaceutical companies and research institutions, for the use of Stellar KLH&#8482; in their programs. We believe that these collaborations provide for strategic, revenue and clinical opportunities for our future business by extending the commercial use of Stellar KLH&#8482; and furthering our understanding of the KLH molecule.

&#160;

For the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and August 31, 2014, research and development expense were $1,715,992, $1,029,489 and $2,458,934, respectively. These amounts related mainly to research and development in aquaculture, improvements in analytical, manufacturing, and purification processes, stability studies, formulation development, and primarily in fiscal 2014, preclinical research for a potential KLH-based immunotherapy approach against C. diff infection. None of these expenses were borne by our customers.

&#160;

Our Stellar KLH&#8482; Products 

&#160;

We market Stellar KLH&#8482; protein in various grades, formulations and configurations for both preclinical and clinical applications, and certain KLH-based in vitro diagnostic kits for preclinical use. Our Stellar KLH&#8482; product offerings include:

&#160;

&#160; Page 8 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Stellar KLH&#8482; protein for conjugation and as carrier molecule in immunotherapy development. We offer a variety of Stellar KLH&#8482; products (HMW and subunit formulations, GMP and research grades, and bulk and vial configurations) for use in these clinical and research applications. 

&#160;

&#183; Stellar KLH&#8482; protein and ELISA test kits for immune function testing: KLH can be used in research and clinical studies as an antigen for assessing immune function and in immunotoxicology studies for monitoring the immunosuppressive effects of drug candidates. We also offer a line of Stellar KLH&#8482; ELISA assay test kits for the detection of anti-KLH antibodies in preclinical research settings. &#160;

&#183; Custom KLH formulations, adjuvants, conjugations and fill finishes for preclinical research and drug development applications. &#160;

We currently have limited revenue from sales of our Stellar KLH&#8482; products. The list price for Stellar KLH&#8482; protein ranges from approximately $15,000 to $50,000 per gram, depending on the purity, grade, preparation, packaging configuration and volume ordered. Product sales are highly dependent upon the rate of development and clinical trials of the active immunotherapies and other technologies being developed by third party customers, which utilize our products. The advancement and commercial success of third-party products utilizing Stellar KLH is dependent upon many factors, including available capital, trial recruitment and progress, and regulatory review. Revenue from these customers is highly variable, but historically is not subject to seasonal fluctuations.

&#160;

Revenues from the sale of Stellar KLH&#8482; products and contract services revenues related to Stellar KLH&#8482; products in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

Contracts, Supply Agreements and Collaboration Agreements 

&#160;

We have previously entered into, and intend to continue to enter into, agreements with third parties that will allow us to supply Stellar KLH&#8482; in exchange for fees, revenues, or royalties. Supply agreements generally involve a customer&#8217;s commitment to purchase our Stellar KLH&#8482; for use as an active pharmaceutical ingredient in the customer&#8217;s own immunotherapy products or as a finished product in their development programs. To date, our Stellar KLH&#8482; protein has been used in research and development, preclinical, and clinical phases but has not yet been used in any commercialized and marketed products. Quantities required for clinical trials depend on, among other variables, the nature of the trial, the clinical indication, the number of patients enrolled, dosing regimens and vaccine manufacturing processes.

&#160; 

Agreements with Neovacs S.A. 

&#160; 

Joint Venture Agreement and Formation of Neostell S.A.S. 

&#160;

In May 2016, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Neovacs S.A., a publicly-held biotechnology company in Paris, France for the formation of a joint venture company to manufacture and sell conjugated therapeutic vaccines. In July 2016, Neostell S.A.S., a French simplified stock corporation (Neostell), was formed to carry out the business of the joint venture. Neostell is expected to produce Neovacs&#8217; Kinoid immunotherapy product candidates which utilize Stellar KLH&#8482; as a carrier molecule ingredient. Neostell may also manufacture and sell other KLH-based immunotherapy products for third-party customers worldwide.

&#160;

We hold a 30% equity interest in the joint venture in exchange for an initial capital contribution of &#8364;120,000. One-half of the initial contribution, approximately $67,000, was paid prior to June 30, 2016 with the balance due upon the occurrence of certain defined future events. We will also provide additional financing to Neostell, as may be required, on a pro rata basis in line with our equity interest. If Neostell does not achieve certain milestones by December 2017, it will be dissolved, unless the parties mutually agree to pursue the joint venture arrangement, or either party decides to purchase the equity interests of the other party. Each of the parties is entitled, upon the occurrence of certain defined events, to acquire the interest of the other party.

&#160;

In connection with the formation of Neostell and the execution of its strategy, the parties intend over time to enter into an exclusive supply agreement within a limited field of use for Stellar to supply KLH to Neostell, a supply agreement designating Neostell as the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of the Neovacs&#8217; vaccines, and services agreements for the provision of various knowledge and expertise by each of the parties. Neovacs will also license certain of its intellectual property to Neostell.

&#160;

The joint venture has an initial ten-year term, renewable for successive five-year terms. If either party provides notice at least six months prior to the expiration date of an applicable term that it does not wish to continue its participation in the joint venture, the other party will have a right to acquire all of such terminating party&#8217;s equity interests in Neostell.

&#160;

&#160; Page 10 

&#160;

&#160;

The joint venture agreement contains customary restrictions on transfer of the equity interests, tag-along and drag-along rights, non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and termination provisions.

&#160;

Supply Agreements 

&#160; 

In April 2015, we entered into a supply agreement with Neovacs to extend and expand two prior supply agreements entered into in 2008 for the use of Stellar KLH&#8482; in the development and manufacture of Neovacs&#8217; active immunotherapies. Stellar KLH&#8482; is used by Neovacs as a carrier molecule to stimulate an immune response in its Kinoid immunotherapy technology, which has two products currently in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of lupus and Crohn&#8217;s disease.

&#160;

The agreement provides for Neovacs to purchase Stellar KLH&#8482; for use in its proprietary KLH-based Kinoid immunotherapies in the European Union, Latin America, Asia, the U.S. and Canada. Neovacs will use Stellar KLH&#8482; for its planned Phase II and Phase III clinical trials and for expected commercial manufacturing of its products for up to one year following market approval. Neovacs will manage and fund all product development and regulatory submissions for its immunotherapy products and act as the sponsor company for the future clinical trials.

&#160;

Under the terms of the agreement, we will supply GMP grade KLH to Neovacs according to agreed specifications, quantities and pricing, as well as maintain a master file with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) for the KLH product. We will also provide professional, technical and regulatory support to Neovacs. The agreement has an initial five-year term, which may be renewed by Neovacs in one-year increments.

&#160;

Collaboration Agreement and Lease Agreement with Ostiones Guerrero S.A. de C.V.(Ostiones) 

&#160;

In July 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Ostiones, a privately held commercial fishing corporation in Baja California, Mexico. The purpose of the agreement is to secure a strategic site in Baja California, Mexico for the potential development of an additional aquaculture locale and future expansion of our KLH production, subject to a site suitability study to be conducted over the next three years.

&#160;

The agreement provides for Stellar and Ostiones to collaborate on the design, expansion and development of marine aquaculture resources and KLH production facilities in Baja California, Mexico to provide, exclusively for Stellar, an additional site for hatchery and maturation of Giant Keyhole Limpets and production of KLH. Ostiones will provide local manpower, labor and operational support, the costs of which are subject to our prior approval and monthly reimbursement. As part of the collaboration, Ostiones will gain access to our proprietary aquaculture techniques and expertise, support services and training to facilitate the expansion of Ostiones&#8217; seafood production business. During the three-year term of the agreement and for five years thereafter, the parties are subject to customary non-competition and non-contravention provisions.

&#160;

In June 2015, we entered into a lease agreement with Ostiones whereby Ostiones leased to Stellar undeveloped land in Baja California, Mexico to assess its suitability for the long-term development and potential expansion of our production capability. The first two years rent was prepaid in June 2015. The lease agreement and the collaboration agreement each expire in June 2018, unless terminated earlier. If we decide to proceed with development of the site, we have options to extend the lease for 30 years.

&#160;

Under the terms of the collaboration and lease agreements, we will be responsible for certain improvements to the leased, undeveloped land, including construction of certain structures and a power-generating facility, which will be owned by us. We expect to enter into separate usage and supply agreements covering the use of site resources and utilities such as seawater and power, and for the production of Giant Keyhole Limpets by Ostiones exclusively for us. However, any such agreements are contingent upon completion of our site suitability assessment and we are currently under no obligation to execute such agreements at this time.

Supply Agreement with Araclon Biotech, S.L. 

&#160;

In November 2014, we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with Araclon Biotech SL, a privately-held biotechnology company headquartered in Spain and majority-owned by global healthcare company Grifols (Araclon). Araclon is developing beta amyloid-targeting active immunotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases with a primary focus on Alzheimer's disease. Araclon's patented technology involves immunization against amyloid-beta together with KLH as a carrier protein.

&#160;

&#160; Page 11 

&#160;

&#160;

The purpose of the agreement is to ensure a stable supply of KLH to Araclon to support Phase II/III clinical trials of Araclon&#8217;s Alzheimer's drugs, including the development of manufacturing processes and production capacity. Under the agreement, Araclon will manage and fund all product development and regulatory submissions for its products. We will supply GMP grade Stellar KLH&#8482; protein and provide technical and regulatory support to Araclon.

&#160;

Under the terms of the agreement, Araclon will purchase KLH exclusively from us, and we will supply KLH exclusively to Araclon, for use in Araclon&#8217;s beta amyloid-targeting active immunotherapies against Alzheimer&#8217;s at agreed specifications, quantities and pricing. In addition, the agreement provides us with first negotiation rights for the exclusive supply of KLH in connection with the potential future commercialization by Araclon of its beta amyloid-targeting immunotherapy products. The agreement has an initial five-year term, which may be renewed by Araclon for additional one-year periods.

&#160;

Intellectual Property and License Agreements 

&#160; 

We hold important proprietary intellectual property related to KLH development and manufacture and to the environmental protection of the Giant Keyhole Limpet including, but not limited to, patents and trade secrets related to specialized aquaculture systems and technologies; spawning, selection and maintenance of the Giant Keyhole Limpet; non-lethal KLH protein extraction methods; and the processing, purification and production of KLH formulations. Our proprietary methods also include methods for the control of larval development, metamorphosis and maturation of the Giant Keyhole Limpets, which we protect as trade secrets.

&#160;

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product technology and know-how, to operate without infringing proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing, when possible, U.S. and foreign patent applications relating to our technology, inventions and improvements that are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

&#160;

We hold patent protection for our non-lethal extraction methods of hemocyanin in the United States and other countries, including one issued patent in the United States, U.S. Patent No. 6,852,338, which currently expires in 2023, and covers a two-step method for obtaining hemolymph from a live gastropod mollusk. This U.S. patent was originally granted to our Chief Executive Officer, Frank Oakes, who assigned the patent to the Company in August 2002. Foreign patent counterparts were granted in Canada, France and Germany.

&#160;

We have a worldwide exclusive license with the University of Guelph to one issued patent in the United States, U.S. Patent No. 8,597,663, which currently expires in 2030, for certain novel cell surface polysaccharides and their chemical structures and vaccine compositions for the treatment, prevention and diagnosis of C. difficile infection. We also have foreign patent counterparts and foreign patent applications and patents claiming priority therefrom in certain jurisdictions outside the United States, including Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Japan and New Zealand.

&#160;

The scope of any patent protection may not exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us, and any of our patents may not be held valid if subsequently challenged, and others may claim rights in or ownership of our patents and proprietary rights. Furthermore, others may develop products similar to our products and may duplicate any of our products or design around our patents.

&#160;

&#160; Page 12 

&#160;

&#160;

Our trademarks include, but are not limited to, &#8220;Powering and Improving Immunotherapy&#8482;&#8221;, &#8220;Stellar KLH&#8482;&#8221; and &#8220;KLH Site&#8482;&#8221;. In addition to patents and trademarks, we rely on trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. We also require our employees, and to the extent practicable, our consultants and advisors with whom we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions made in the course of our working relationship with them, while using our intellectual property or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to wrongfully obtain or use information that we regard as proprietary.

&#160;

License Agreement with University of Guelph 

&#160;

In July 2013, we acquired the exclusive, worldwide license to certain patented technology for the development of human immunotherapies against Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), a highly contagious bacteria spread by human contact, from the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada (the &#8220;Guelph License&#8221;). Under the terms of the Guelph License, we have the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, and sell active immunotherapies to treat C. diff infection that derive from the technology covered by certain of the University&#8217;s international patents and patent applications.

&#160;

The Guelph License agreement required an initial, non-refundable license fee of $25,000, which was paid in fiscal 2013, payment of an aggregate of $200,000 in delayed license fees, which were paid in fiscal 2014, and a license fee of $20,000 to be paid annually thereafter, creditable against royalties due, if any. Royalties are payable for a percentage of related net sales, if any. License fees are also payable for a percentage of related non-royalty sublicensing revenue, if any. No royalties have been incurred to date.

&#160;

As additional consideration, we also issued to the University of Guelph 37,120 common shares and warrants to purchase up to 27,840 of our common shares with an exercise price of C$12.50 per share. The warrants expired on January 23, 2015 without being exercised. We reimbursed patent filing costs of approximately $11,000, $52,000, and $34,000 in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and will reimburse certain future patent filing, prosecution, and maintenance costs.

&#160;

We are required to pay up to an aggregate of $6,020,000 in milestone payments to the University of Guelph upon achievement of various financing and development targets up to the first regulatory approval. Remaining milestone payments totaling $57,025,000 are related to achievement of sales targets. We are required to provide regular reports to the University of Guelph regarding product development efforts, and progress toward meeting certain milestones. A financing milestone was met during fiscal 2014 and, accordingly, we made a milestone payment of $100,000 to the University of Guelph. No other milestones have been met to date, and there can be no assurance that any remaining milestones will be met in the future.

&#160;

The Guelph License agreement expires when the last valid patent claim licensed under the agreement expires, which is currently 2030. Prior to that time, the agreement can be terminated by the University of Guelph upon certain conditions including: (i) our failure to make any payments or submit any reports when due; (ii) our failure to diligently pursue development or commercialization of the product based upon our reports; (iii) our material breach of any provision of the Guelph License; or (iv) providing a false report. We will have 30 days after written notice from the University of Guelph to cure the problem prior to termination of the agreement. We can terminate the Guelph License with three months&#8217; prior written notice to the University of Guelph.

Collaboration Agreement and Exclusive Licensing Rights with Bayer Innovation GmbH 

&#160;

In August 2011 we acquired an exclusive, worldwide sub-licensable and royalty-free license to the technology we developed under collaboration with Bayer Innovation GmbH (Bayer) for the improved production method and process yields for Stellar KLH&#8482;. The license included a carve-out by Bayer to use the technology in certain non-Hodgkin Lymphoma active immunotherapies, but we may exclusively commercialize the technology in other fields. We paid Bayer $200,000 in 2011 for the licensing rights, which are jointly owned by Bayer and us. We assessed the licensing rights for impairment and wrote off the unamortized balance in July 2014.

&#160;

Grants 

&#160;

We have historically financed a portion of our operations through the receipt of monetary grants made available through programs funded and administered by various U.S. government entities.

&#160;

In the fiscal 2014, we recognized, through our California subsidiary, the remaining $36,579 in grant funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) through the Technology Enhancement for Commercial Partnerships program under Phase II and Phase IIB grants, which totaled approximately $1.2 million over a 4-year period. Our project was entitled &#8220; Megathura Crenulata Post Larval Culture - Bottleneck for a Valuable Medical Resource,&#8221; and the purpose of the project was to allow for the full implementation of the commercial scale aquaculture systems for KLH production and development of a validated KLH-based immunogenicity assay. Grant revenues were recorded as we fulfilled the grant requirements. In addition to NSF grants, we also receive grants from time to time for the development of new technology from the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NIH), the California Technology Investments Program (CalTIP), and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) qualifying therapeutic discovery project grants.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The immunotherapy industry is rapidly evolving and new competitors with competing technologies and products are regularly entering clinical development and the market. We compete on the basis of: the advantages and disadvantages of Stellar KLH TM as compared to other KLH proteins manufactured by our competitors; our ability to educate the industry about the high quality, and sustainable and traceable features, of Stellar KLH TM ; our ability to supply scalable quantities of GMP grade KLH; product efficacy; customer service; and the price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness of Stellar KLH TM as compared to our competitors. We believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to such factors. However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We compete directly with Biosyn Corporation, a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company which manufactures KLH starting material and offers clinical and research grade KLH products. We also compete directly with SAFC, a division of Sigma-Aldrich, which offers clinical and research grade KLH products manufactured from its own starting material from ocean harvested limpets and from aquaculture starting material purchased from us. In addition to competition from current suppliers of KLH, we also face indirect competition from developers of other carrier proteins, adjuvants or therapeutic vaccine platforms. We are unable to predict what effect evolution of the KLH and immunotherapy industries and potential new entrants may have on price, selling strategies, intellectual property or our competitive position.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our operations, including our aquaculture and harvesting activities, as well as production operations, site development, and drug research, development and sales, are subject to complex regulation at the local, state and federal levels in the United States by a number of regulatory agencies including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy, the Regional Water Quality Control Board Los Angeles Region, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the California Coastal Commission, the California Air Pollution Control Board, the County of Ventura, and the City of Port Hueneme.

&#160;

We are subject to laws and regulations covering clean water and waste discharge, and are required to hold licenses for the aquaculture production and wild harvesting of the Giant Keyhole Limpet. Our aquaculture facility is subject to regulation by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region. These agencies impose regulations that restrict any activity that could pose a potential risk to the California marine environment including, but not limited to, seawater waste discharge limitations specified in our National Pollution Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permit. We have operated in compliance with all environmental regulations imposed by these agencies since the formation of our California subsidiary in 1999, apart from a de minimus settlement in April 2014.

&#160;

&#160; Page 14 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to regulations in the United States, we may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations related to research, manufacturing, and the commercial sale and distribution of our products, to the extent we choose to manufacture, sell or distribute any products outside of the United States. The requirements governing our activities in jurisdictions outside the United States vary greatly from country to country.

&#160;

Product Development and Customer Regulatory Support 

&#160; 

Currently, none of our products are subject to approval as a drug by any regulatory authority. However, a number of our customers and strategic partners are utilizing Stellar KLH&#8482; in the development of pharmaceuticals and immunotherapies that are subject to the regulatory approval process in various jurisdictions.

&#160;

We have submitted Type II Master Files for our KLH drug substance and drug product formulations to the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). A Master File is a confidential, detailed dossier kept on file at the FDA that contains the proprietary information on the manufacture and safety of a drug component. These files can be used to support the regulatory approval process for customers&#8217; immunotherapy products that use our Stellar KLH&#8482;, while allowing us to control access to our manufacturing data.

&#160;

The regulatory approval process for new drugs under development by our customers is typically long and expensive. Clinical trials that they conduct may not be successful and such products may not receive regulatory approval. Delays by our customers in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, regulatory approvals for their products which use Stellar KLH TM will have a direct effect on the demand for our products. 

&#160;

Good Manufacturing Practices 

&#160;

The FDA and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. All facilities and manufacturing techniques used for the manufacture of our products must comply with applicable regulations governing the production of pharmaceutical products known as Current Good Manufacturing Practices.

&#160;

The FDA and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may issue warning or similar letters or may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions against us. To date, we have not been subject to inspection by the FDA or other drug regulatory agency because none of our customers or partners has filed an application in any country for marketing approval of a product encompassing our Stellar KLH&#8482; protein.

&#160;

Backlog and Renegotiation of Profits

&#160;

Orders for our products are generally filled on a current basis, and order backlog is not material to our business. In addition, our business is not subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of December 9, 2016, we had 23 employees. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement.
