Organization

&#160;

BioAdaptives, Inc., (&#8220;BioAdaptives,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 19, 2013, as APEX 8 Inc. From inception through October 21, 2013, the Company was in the developmental stage and conducted virtually no business operations, other than organizational activities and preparation of a registration statement on Form 10 (the &#8220;Registration Statement&#8221;). The Form 10 was filed on May 3, 2013, and went effective following a review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). On June 11, 2013, the SEC informed the Company the SEC staff had no further comments.

Subsequently, on June 21, 2013, our former sole officer and director, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which he sold an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of his shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock to Ferris Holding Inc. at a purchase price of $40,000. In aggregate, these shares represented 100% of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding common stock. Effective upon the closing of the Share Purchase Agreement, our former sole officer and director owned no shares of the Company&#8217;s stock.

&#160;

Additionally, on June 21, 2013, the Company accepted the resignations of our former sole officer and director as the Company&#8217;s President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Directors. These resignations were in connection with the consummation of the Share Purchase Agreement with Ferris Holding Inc., and were not the result of any disagreement with Company on any matter relating to Company's operations, policies or practices. Effective as of the same date, to fill the vacancies created by our former sole officer and director's resignations, the Company elected and appointed Barry K. Epling as Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Gerald A. Epling, President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and Member of the Board of Directors of the Registrant.

&#160;

Subsequently, on September 25, 2013, pursuant to board and shareholder approval, we changed our name from APEX 8 Inc. to BioAdaptives, Inc., and filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.

On July 14, 2014, the Company announced changes in its management. Gerald A. Epling, who had been serving as the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and a Director, resigned from all positions. His resignation was in connection to pursue other interests, and was not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations or practices. On that same day, the Company elected Barry Epling, who also serves as Chief Executive Officer, President and Director of Ferris Holding (FHI) to the positions vacated by Gerald Epling. As of the date of the event, FHI was the Company's controlling stockholder.

Barry Epling, who had been serving as the Company's President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary, resigned from his positions.

Strategy

&#160;

BioAdaptives Inc. is a research, development, and educational company. Our current focus is on products that improve health and wellness. These products include dietary supplements, specialty food items, and proprietary methods of optimizing the bioelectromagnetic availability of foods and beverages. Our base of intellectual property and products, which are patent pending solutions in the form of devices and nutraceuticals, are designed to aid in cognition, focus, fatigue reduction, increased testosterone, improved overall emotional and physical wellness, healing, and anti-aging.

The Company's strategy is to develop a position as a leader in supplying quality nutraceutical products to an aging population within developed countries such as the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia, and in Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, while continuing to create new innovative, health inspired products to generate growth in sales and profitability. Specifically, the Company seeks to:

&#160;

1. Create market share in the rapidly growing aging population demographic. The Company's strategy is to create its share in the this demographic within developed countries by (i) emphasizing the benefits of its proprietary nutraceutical and AgronifierTM products and technology as well as creating additional products, and (ii) utilizing its marketing division to act as its sales and distribution arm to seek additional channels for sales coverage.

&#160;

2. Focus on the aging population of developed countries. The Company believes that the population growth in the aged population demographic presents a unique opportunity. The World Health Organization has stated that the population growth for those 60 years and older will more than double from 11% to over 22% between 2000 and 2050, with the absolute number of people aged 60 and over expected to increase from 605 million to 2 billion within the same period. Additionally, according to the World Health Organization, the number of people aged 80 years or older will quadruple to 395 million within the next 30 years.

&#160;

3. Make strategic acquisitions. The Company plans to capitalize on the significant opportunities for consolidation available in the nutraceutical industry. The Company anticipates that it will seek acquisitions that serve to expand the Company's product brands, broaden its product offerings or facilitate entry into complementary distribution channels. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company had not entered into any definitive agreements or negotiations relating to acquisitions.

&#160;

4. Continue to develop new products and product extensions. The Company seeks to continue to develop and commercialize nutraceutical products and through this effort intends to develop new and innovative products. During 2014, Ferris Holding, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Ferris&#8221;), rebranded NutraLoad&#8482; and Bliss In A Bottle&#8482;, to PrimiCell&#169; and PrimiLive&#169; in an effort to keep a more consistent product naming convention going forward, and pursuant to the Product Agreement with Ferris, the Company continues to have the right to develop, market, and sell these products. Additionally, two new products are in the advanced stage of testing and may be introduced for general use in the first quarter of 2015. Equine Regen&#8482; and Equine Regen Plus&#8482;. Both have been tested extensively in the United States, Australia, Singapore, and Europe. The results of equine products have been favorable. The product comes with a higher cost, however, very cost effective when used by trainers and owners of performance horses. Thoroughbreds, polo ponies, cutting horses, barrel racers, and other competition horses have shown significant improvement in hooves, coat, mane, strength, speed, endurance, recovery, responsiveness, and several other areas which overall improvements has been attributed to the increase in stem cells in horses.

&#160;

The Company introduced two other products in 2015. One of which is PrimiTrim&#8482;,a weight control product with many side benefits that add to overall wellness. Tests have shown consistent weight loss of between one and three pounds per week. The loss is not water weight and as a result, is more meaningful to the people using the product. The other produce expects is an exercise product targeting those who do extreme work-outs and seek better results. One benefit of the product is that it helps the body process lactic acid more quickly, speeding recovery and allowing more strenuous work-outs.

&#160;

The company retained Total Spectrum Advertising in May 2015 to develop marketing plans for our current line of products. These plans are proceeding well. During the market assessment phase of the planning process, the Company identified a large opportunity for pet related nutraceutical products. We commenced development of a product for dogs, which we expect to introduce in 2016.

5. Capitalize on strong international growth. The Company believes that international sales represent a significant growth opportunity as aging population growth outside North America exceeds 1 billion people. The Company plans to aggressively pursue international sales by adding additional salespeople within its marketing division, developing a network in high growth regions, and continuing its efforts to register products and trademarks in attractive foreign markets.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of April 14, 2016, the Company had 1 full-time employee and no part-time employees. The company uses competent outside contractors to complete research and manufacture products. Management believes that our relationship with our employees and contractors is good.
