 ITEM 1. Business 

Overview 

Five9 is a pioneer and leading provider of cloud software for contact centers. Since our inception, we have exclusively focused on delivering our platform in the cloud and are disrupting a significantly large market by replacing legacy on-premise contact center systems. Contact centers are vital hubs of interaction between organizations and their customers and, therefore, are essential to delivering successful customer service, sales and marketing strategies. Our mission is to empower organizations to transform their contact centers into customer engagement centers of excellence, while improving business agility and significantly lowering the cost and complexity of their contact center operations. Our purpose-built, highly scalable and secure Virtual Contact Center (&#8220;VCC&#8221;) cloud platform delivers a comprehensive suite of easy-to-use applications that enable the breadth of contact center-related customer service, sales and marketing functions. We have become an established leader in the cloud contact center market, facilitating approximately three billion &#32;interactions between our more than 2,000 &#32;clients and their customers per year. We believe our ability to combine software and telephony into a single unified platform that is delivered in the cloud creates a significant barrier to entry. 

Based on our current product offering and historical average annual recurring revenue per seat, we believe that the market for our solution is approximately $24 billion &#32;annually worldwide. Gartner estimates that there were 15.8 million contact center agents worldwide in 2015. &#32; Furthermore, Gartner has estimated that cloud penetration of the contact center market in North America would grow from approximately 5% of total contact center agents in 2012 to 13% in 2016 . We believe adoption of cloud contact center software solutions is increasing rapidly as a result of several distinct trends. The increasing adoption of cloud computing, especially within customer relationship management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) is creating strong demand for integrated cloud contact center software solutions. In addition, cloud contact center software solutions now offer the functionality required by large, complex enterprise contact centers. Furthermore, we believe organizations typically refresh their contact center systems every 8-10 years, which provides an opportunity for cloud solutions to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems when these replacement decisions arise. 

Cloud contact center software solutions are replacing legacy on-premise contact center systems. On-premise systems require large up-front investments, long deployment cycles and are burdensome to maintain. These systems are also often inflexible, complex, and require significant duplication of effort and integration across multiple sites. This creates substantial challenges for clients with on-premise contact center systems to implement new features or upgrades, or to integrate with adjacent cloud solutions. 

Our solution, which is comprised of our VCC cloud platform and applications, allows simultaneous management and optimization of customer interactions across voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile channels, either directly or through our application programming interface (&#8220;API&#8221;). Our VCC cloud platform matches each customer interaction with an appropriate agent resource and delivers relevant customer data to the agent in real-time through integrations with adjacent enterprise applications, such as CRM software, to optimize the customer experience and improve agent productivity. Our solution ensures our clients always have the latest version of our software. Delivered on-demand, our solution enables our clients to quickly deploy agent seats in any geographic location with only a computer, headset and broadband internet connection, and rapidly adjust the number of contact center agent seats in response to changing business requirements. Unlike legacy on-premise contact center systems, our solution requires minimal up-front investment, can be rapidly deployed and is maintained by us in the cloud. 

Our sales model consists of a field sales team that sells our solution into larger opportunities and a telesales team that sells our solution into smaller opportunities. We have developed a proven, high velocity, metrics-driven sales and marketing strategy, which is designed to effectively identify, qualify and close sales opportunities. To complement this go-to-market strategy, we have developed a large ecosystem of technology and system integrator partners and independent software vendors to help increase awareness of our solution in the market and drive incremental sales opportunities with new and existing clients. 

We provide our solution through a software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) business model with recurring subscriptions based primarily on the number of agent seats and minutes of usage, as well as the specific functionalities and applications our clients deploy. Our recurring revenue model combined with our Annual Dollar- 

Based Retention Rate, which was 96% &#32;as of December 31, 2015, have enhanced our ability to forecast our financial performance and plan future investments. For a description of how our Annual Dollar-Based Retention Rate is calculated, please refer to ITEM 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We have achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our revenues were $128.9 million , $103.1 million and $84.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 25% &#32;and 23%, respectively. We incurred net losses of $25.8 million , $37.8 million and $31.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, as a result of increased investment in our growth. As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our total assets were $99.2 million , $116.9 million &#32;and $56.3 million , respectively. 

We operate in a single reportable segment. Please refer to the geographical information for each of the last three years in Note 12 &#32;of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Please refer to the discussion of risks related to our foreign operations in the section entitled &#8220;ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Industry Overview 

Contact centers must evolve in today&#8217;s rapidly changing technology environment 

Contact centers are vital hubs of interaction between organizations and their customers and are mission critical to the successful execution of customer service, sales and marketing strategies. Both consumer and enterprise technology trends are driving an evolution in contact center strategies. Today, customers increasingly expect seamless communications across multiple channels, including voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile, thereby increasing the number of touch points between organizations and their customers. Along with these additional channels, customers expect personalized interactions to enhance overall customer service. Delivering customer interactions to an appropriate agent resource while delivering relevant customer data to the agent in real-time is crucial in providing effective customer service. 

As the needs of organizations and their customers have become more sophisticated, so have the demands for contact centers. Striving for greater efficiency in meeting demand, the use of remote agents and geographically dispersed contact centers has proliferated. To increase capacity and undertake upgrades, on-premise contact centers must unify geographically dispersed agents and hardware, which requires building out teams and facilities to forecasted future capacity and is a long-term undertaking. In order to meet these changing demands, contact centers must upgrade their existing on-premise contact center systems or migrate their contact center operations to the cloud. 

Legacy on-premise contact center systems are inefficient 

The majority of contact center operations today rely on legacy on-premise contact center systems that include business workflows, as well as hardware and software architectures designed more than a decade ago. Legacy on-premise contact center systems are typically developed for location-specific deployments and are often costly, inflexible, complex and require significant duplication of effort and integration across multiple sites. Key shortcomings of these legacy systems include: 

&#8226; 

Long and complex implementation and upgrade cycles. &#32;&#32;&#32;Implementation of legacy on-premise contact center systems requires long deployment timelines and complex integrations with other enterprise systems. Once these systems have been deployed, integrated and customized, upgrades and modifications can be extremely challenging. Due to these customized solutions and complex integrations, clients will often forego or postpone upgrades for fear of disabling key functionality. If they do choose to upgrade, clients are often required to rebuild integrations in order to retain full functionality, which frequently results in significant expenditures of time, resources and capital. 

&#8226; 

Inflexible resource deployment. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;As organizations expand globally, they require the ability to easily manage remote agents and quickly adjust agent seats to accommodate peak call volumes. Most legacy on-premise contact center systems do not provide these capabilities and, as a result, their clients are typically unable to quickly scale their contact center operations in response to changing business needs. This often results in costly over-building of additional capacity to accommodate peak volumes. 

&#8226; 

Duplicative technology stacks across multiple sites. &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Organizations must integrate multiple contact center sites to drive efficiency and create a unified customer view. Organizations running on-premise systems often find themselves with dissimilar systems at each site resulting in non-integrated and inefficient silos of 

technology. Moreover, technology at each site is in a constant state of change over time. The initial and ongoing integration of these contact center sites for such organizations requires significant ongoing investment. 

Our Opportunity 

Based on our current product offerings and historical average annual recurring revenue per seat, we believe that the market for our solution is approximately $24 billion &#32;annually worldwide. Gartner estimates that there were 15.8 million contact center agents worldwide in 2015. &#32; Furthermore, Gartner has estimated that cloud penetration of the contact center market in North America would grow from approximately 5% of total contact center agents in 2012 to 13% in 2016 . We believe the market for contact center solutions is undergoing a significant shift to the cloud driven primarily by: 

&#8226; 

Adoption of cloud CRM solutions 

&#8226; 

Sophistication of cloud contact center software solutions 

&#8226; 

Technology refresh of on-premise contact center systems 

&#8226; 

Simplicity of the cloud vs. complexity of legacy on-premise 

Adoption of cloud CRM solutions has grown as organizations seek to enhance their sales strategies, increase business agility and reduce costs. CRM solutions typically integrate deeply with contact center solutions to provide agents with real-time access to customer information. The shift to cloud CRM and ease of integration are creating significant demand for integrated cloud contact center software solutions. As the market opportunity has expanded, cloud contact center software solutions have evolved to meet the requirements of large, complex enterprise contact centers. We believe organizations have typically refreshed their on-premise contact center systems every 8-10 years. Given the prevalence of cloud CRM and the capabilities of cloud-based contact centers, cloud solutions are increasingly considered as a replacement alternative to legacy on-premise contact center systems during these refresh decisions.

Our Growth Strategy 

Our objective is to strengthen our position as a leader in cloud contact center software. To accomplish this goal, we are pursuing the following growth strategies: 

&#8226; 

Capture increased market share . We believe that the adoption of cloud contact center software solutions is increasingly driven by mainstream adoption of cloud computing, especially within CRM, as well as the increasing capabilities of these solutions. With organizations refreshing their contact center systems every 8-10 years, cloud solutions have an opportunity to replace legacy on-premise contact center systems at the time a replacement decision is made. We believe there is a substantial opportunity for us to win new clients and increase our market share given the strength and client benefits of our cloud solution. We intend to continue to invest aggressively in our sales force and marketing capabilities to win new clients. 

&#8226; 

Continue to increase sales in our existing client base . Many of our clients deploy our solution to support only a portion of their contact center agents initially. We intend to increase the number of agents using our solution within our existing clients as they experience the benefits of our cloud solution. We also intend to sell our existing clients incremental applications to increase our revenue and the value of our existing client relationships. 

&#8226; 

Maintain our innovation leadership by strengthening and extending our solution . We have an innovative platform that has enabled us to establish a leadership position in the cloud contact center software market. To preserve and expand our leadership position, we intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to strengthen our existing solution and develop additional industry-leading contact center features and applications. 

&#8226; 

Expand internationally . To date, our primary focus has been on the U.S. market, which represented 93% , 92% and 90% of our revenue in 2015, 2014 and 2013, based on bill to address. We believe there is a significant opportunity for our cloud solution to disrupt incumbent legacy on-premise contact center systems internationally. We plan to increase our sales capabilities internationally by expanding our direct sales force and collaborating with strategic partners to target these markets and grow our international client base. We have co-location data center facilities in Europe to provide clients in certain countries of the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) with regional access to our cloud contact center solution to better serve local needs. 

&#8226; 

Further develop our partner ecosystem . We have established strong partner relationships with organizations in the contact center ecosystem to further enhance the value of our VCC cloud platform. We intend to continue to cultivate new relationships with additional software, technology, system integrator, independent software vendors and telephony providers to enhance the value of our solution and drive sales. 

&#8226; 

Selectively pursue acquisitions . In addition to organically developing and strengthening our solution, we intend to selectively explore acquisition opportunities of companies and technologies to expand the functionality of our solution, provide access to new clients or markets, or both. 

Our Virtual Contact Center Cloud Platform and Applications 

Our cloud contact center software solution consists of our highly scalable VCC cloud platform that delivers a comprehensive suite of easy-to-use, secure applications to cover the breadth of contact center-related customer service, sales and marketing functions. Our VCC cloud platform acts as the hub for omnichannel engagement between our clients and their customers. This enables clients to fully manage the end-to-end customer experience in a single unified architecture. Our solution enables our clients to manage customer interactions across multiple channels including voice, chat, email, web, social media and mobile and connects them to the most appropriate agent. Whether the resource is an internal contact center agent, an outsourcer, an agent working from home, a knowledge worker, or self-service, our solution enables our clients to deliver a highly effective customer experience. 

Our solution is built using a multi-tenant architecture and delivered in the cloud. The following diagram illustrates our VCC cloud platform and comprehensive suite of applications used by agents, supervisors and administrators. In addition, we provide a robust set of management applications including workforce management, reporting, quality management and supervisor tools. 

&#32; 

Inbound Contact Center : With our VCC cloud platform, organizations of all sizes have everything they need to handle their inbound customer engagement. This includes the ability to take voice calls, respond to chat, email, and engage with a wide range of social media sources. Our platform includes a full-featured IVR system that allows our clients to provide a self-service capability and to automatically determine the customer intent and identify the type of resource to best handle the customer enquiry. At the center of our VCC cloud platform is the ACD module which provides intelligent routing of customer interactions. This enables clients to classify and prioritize 

customer interactions and ensure that the interactions are delivered to the most appropriate resource to provide the best customer experience and maximize business results. 

Through CTI capabilities, out-of-the-box integrations with CRM solutions (such as Salesforce, Oracle, Zendesk, NetSuite, and Microsoft), or easy to use open APIs, clients can provide a personalized customer experience by prioritizing important customers and delivering customer information to the agent handling the interaction. This promotes quick first contact resolution, which is a key factor in delivering a superior customer experience. 

Outbound Contact Center: &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Our Outbound Contact Center application enables our clients to improve the efficiency and productivity of outbound contact center agents. We provide a complete solution for outbound sales and marketing campaigns, including multiple automated dialing options, so our clients can find the right match for their needs and environment, whether outbound business-to-consumer (&#8220;B2C&#8221;), business-to-business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;), or 1:1 proactive customer care. We provide a variety of outbound dialer modes, including a patented predictive dialer capability. The predictive dialer greatly enhances the productivity of agents and sales representatives by increasing productive talk time and minimizing idle time spent listening to voice mail and busy signals. These dialer solutions allow our clients to choose the automation capabilities that best align with their contact center environment and objectives, including lead prospecting, qualifying, nurturing and converting. We also provide campaign management tools such as list management, sophisticated dialer rules and agent scripting. In addition, we provide the TCPA manual touch mode option that provides tools to outbound clients to ensure that they are able to comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;TCPA&#8221;), regulations. 

Blended Contact Center: We provide both inbound and outbound capabilities on a single platform to unify contact center operations and enable end-to-end customer engagement. This improves agent productivity as interactions are automatically selected and routed to agents based on interaction volume. When inbound call volumes are low, the blending ability allows clients to shift inbound agent resources to outbound-related functions. For example, inbound agents can be assigned to the outbound queue for automatic follow-ups on any customer interaction, flag customer surveys for personalized attention, or resolve open customer issues. Agents are provided with a script which also contributes to their effectiveness. 

Multichannel Applications Powered by Five9 Connect: &#32;Our multichannel applications are powered by a unique set of technologies called Five9 Connect&#8482;. These technologies include an advanced Natural Language Processing (&#8220;NLP&#8221;), engine to filter and categorize interactions, eliminate spam and determine sentiment. Based on a client&#8217;s unique set of business policies and needs, our solution provides simpler, smarter, and more productive multichannel engagement by offering agents Sentiment Analysis, Clustering, Trending Topics, and Relevance. In addition, Five9 Connect powers agent assistance tools to help agents resolve issues quickly. 

Five9 VCC integrates voice with chat, email, web, social media and mobile applications for a true omnichannel agent and customer experience. 

&#8226; 

Five9 Social - Applies contact center customer service and sales best practices to social channels. Our solution routes, tracks and reports on agent performance in responding to social media posts in the same manner as other channels. 

&#8226; 

Five9 Chat - Live consumer-to-agent chat from mobile or web devices gives agents the ability to respond, record and manage multiple chat interactions. 

&#8226; 

Five9 Email - Makes email a high-response sales, service and support channel. Our email routing capability filters and intelligently routes email requests to enable the best qualified agents to respond in a timely manner. 

&#8226; 

Five9 Visual IVR - Our visual IVR application provides mobile customer care for today&#8217;s connected customers. It allows clients to develop an IVR script once and deploy it on multiple touchpoints, including mobile devices and websites. 

Management Applications: &#32;&#32;&#32;Our integrated portfolio of management applications is built and delivered on our highly scalable and flexible VCC cloud platform. The solution provides real-time supervisor tools to monitor and manage the performance of agents and call flows. Also provided is a suite of configurable management reports to enable clients to manage the end-to-end performance of their contact center operations. The solution has native recording capabilities for contact centers that need to record their interactions. For clients with high-end needs, the solution can provide fully integrated workforce and quality management applications through our strategic relationship with NICE Systems, Inc. 

Our clients can access our VCC cloud platform in five different ways: 

&#8226; 

Agent Desktop: &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Serves as the unified environment for contact center agents. Agents are provided with one easy-to-use desktop that allows agents to quickly switch between channels. Our universal transaction model adjusts to the needs of the interaction, including voice, chat, email, web, social media or mobile, yet feels familiar to the agent, making training simple. Automated call scripting and real-time customer data, such as purchase and interaction history, is delivered to empower agents with the information they need to deliver a superior customer experience. 

&#8226; 

CRM Integrations: &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;For clients who prefer to have their agents or sales representatives work within their CRM desktop, Five9 offers pre-built integrations with leading providers of CRM systems such as Salesforce, Oracle, Zendesk, Microsoft and NetSuite. In addition, professional services can provide integrations with home grown or legacy CRM systems. Our solution provides softphone and telephony capabilities within the CRM desktop, and routes each customer interaction to an appropriate agent resource. Agents are able to work within a familiar desktop, equipped with full telephony controls and giving them immediate access to the most current, relevant and accurate information about the customer. 

&#8226; 

Supervisor: &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Provides supervisors with tools to optimize the contact center and ensure high quality customer interactions. These tools include a visual supervisor dashboard that provides easy to use visibility into call routing, queues, service levels, workflow management, utilization, campaign statistics and agent productivity. A mobile tablet version of the supervisor application is also available to help supervisors monitor agents, listen in on conversations, coach agents, and oversee queues and agent performance metrics. These metrics typically include average handle time, first contact resolution, number of interactions handled and contact outcomes. 

&#8226; 

Administrator: &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Provides administrators with a comprehensive set of integrated tools to easily configure agent skills (such as language, domain expertise, and channels to service), determine interaction routing strategies, specify IVR scripts and manage the contact center operation. The Five9 Administrator system is easy to use so that contact center business personnel can set up and make changes themselves, without having to rely on specialized IT staff often required to manage legacy on-premise contact center systems. This represents a key advantage of our VCC cloud platform as it allows businesses to adapt quickly to keep up with the rapid changes required in contact center operations. 

&#8226; 

Reporting and Analytics: &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Real-time and historical reports provide statistics and key performance indicators to allow executives and supervisors to monitor the contact center, improve reaction time to interaction volume and manage agents more effectively. We provide more than 150 standard reports with multiple views and drill-downs into individual inbound calls and multichannel interaction metrics, customer interaction outcomes, and outbound sales and marketing program metrics. Our reporting module also enables clients to build customized reports and reporting schedules. 

Clients 

We have a large and diverse client base comprised of over 2,000 &#32;organizations as of December 31, 2015, with no single client representing more than 10% of our revenues in 2015, 2014 or 2013. Our client base spans organizations of all sizes across multiple industries, including banking and financial services, business process outsourcers, consumer, healthcare and technology. 

Sales 

Our sales model consists of a field sales team that sells our solution into larger opportunities and a telesales team that sells our solution into smaller opportunities. We established our business targeting smaller opportunities and have expanded our sales focus to larger opportunities as we gained traction in the market and enhanced the capabilities of our cloud solution. We have developed a disciplined, high volume, metrics-driven sales strategy, designed to enable us to efficiently generate and close a large number of new sales opportunities. Our telesales team focuses on qualified leads generated through traffic to our websites, and also supports our field sales team through lead generation and lead-tracking activities. Our field and telesales teams are also responsible for selling to existing clients that may renew their subscriptions, increase the number of agents using our cloud solution, add new applications from our solution and expand the deployment of our solution across their contact centers. 

Marketing 

To build client awareness and adoption of our solution, our lead generation activities consist primarily of client referrals, internet advertising, digital marketing campaigns, social marketing, trade shows, industry events, co-marketing with strategic partners and telemarketing. In addition, our industry analyst, press and media outreach programs, and web site marketing initiatives are designed to build brand awareness and preference for Five9. We offer free trials and services to allow prospective clients to experience the quality and ease-of-use of our cloud solution, to learn about the features and functionality of our VCC cloud platform in more detail, and to quantify the benefits of our cloud solution. 

To complement our sales and marketing efforts, we have developed a large ecosystem of software, technology, telephony and system integrator partners and independent software vendors who help increase awareness of our solution and generate new and installed base sales opportunities. 

Research and Development 

Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to improve the functionality of, and add new features to, our VCC cloud platform. Our core research and development center is based in our San Ramon, California headquarters with additional engineers located in Russia, which allows us to benefit from relatively low-cost and highly skilled software developers. Our engineering team has deep software and telecommunications skills, and works closely with our sales team to identify our clients&#8217; product requirements. In addition, continuous interactions with our partners enable our engineers to enhance the usability and performance of our platform and its integration with best-in-class CRM and other business applications and telephony technologies. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 167 &#32;employees in our research and development group, of which 97 &#32;were based in Russia. Our research and development expenses totaled $22.7 million , $22.1 million and $17.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We intend to continue investing in research and development to continue to deliver robust functionality to our clients. 

Professional Services 

We offer comprehensive professional services to our clients to assist in the successful implementation and optimization of our solution. Our professional services include application configuration, system integration, and education and training. Our clients may use our professional services team for implementing our solution or, in limited cases, they may also choose to perform these services themselves or engage third-party service providers to perform such services. Our cloud solution allows us to eliminate the need for lengthy and complex technology integrations, such as deploying equipment or maintaining hardware infrastructure for individual clients. As a result, we are typically able to deploy and optimize our solution in significantly less time than required for deployments of legacy on-premise contact center systems. 

Technology and Operations 

Our highly scalable and flexible VCC cloud platform is the result of more than 13 years of research, development, client engagement and operational experience. The platform is comprised of in-house developed intellectual property, open source products and commercially available hardware and software. The platform is designed to be redundant and we believe that all components can be upgraded, expanded or replaced with minimal or no interruption in service. 

We currently deliver our services globally from four third-party co-location data center facilities located in Santa Clara, California; Atlanta, Georgia; Slough, England and Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Our infrastructure, including our third-party co-location facilities, is designed to support real-time mission-critical telecommunications, applications and operational support systems. Our infrastructure is built with redundant, fault-tolerant components divided into distinct security zones forming protective layers for our applications and customer data. 

We have designed and maintain an operations, capacity and security program to monitor and maintain our platform, ensure efficient utilization of the platform capacity and protect against security threats or data breaches. Our operations team constantly monitors our data centers for potential performance issues, unauthorized attempts to access secure data or applications and the overall integrity of the platform. 

Competition 

The market for contact center software is fragmented, highly competitive and evolving rapidly in response to shifting consumer behavior, especially the rapid adoption of mobile devices and social media. The proliferation of each is driving change in contact center technology, as customers expect companies to give them the option of seamless communication across any channel according to their preference and needs. Combined with the disruptive nature of the cloud in the contact center, this has resulted in competitors who come from different market and product heritages, and who vary in size, breadth and scope of the products and services offered. We currently compete with large legacy on-premise contact center system vendors that offer on-premise enterprise telephony and contact center systems, such as Avaya Inc. (&#8220;Avaya&#8221;) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (&#8220;Cisco&#8221;), and legacy on-premise software companies with a historical focus on CTI, such as Aspect Software, Inc. (&#8220;Aspect&#8221;), Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. (&#8220;Genesys&#8221;), and Interactive Intelligence Group, Inc. (&#8220;Interactive Intelligence&#8221;). These companies are expanding their traditional on-premise contact center systems with cloud-based offerings, either through acquisitions or in-house development. Additionally, we compete with vendors that historically provided other contact center services and technologies and expanded to offer cloud contact center software. These companies include inContact, Inc. (&#8220;inContact&#8221;) and LiveOps, Inc. (&#8220;LiveOps&#8221;). We also face competition from smaller contact center service providers with specialized contact center software offerings. Our actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and greater financial and technical resources. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include: 

&#8226; 

breadth and depth of solution features; 

&#8226; 

reliability, scalability and quality of the platform; 

&#8226; 

ease and speed of deployment; 

&#8226; 

ease of application administration and use; 

&#8226; 

level of client satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

domain expertise in contact center operations; 

&#8226; 

integration with third-party applications; 

&#8226; 

pricing; 

&#8226; 

ability to quickly adjust agent seats based on business requirements; 

&#8226; 

breadth and domain expertise of the sales, marketing and support organization; 

&#8226; 

ability to keep pace with client requirements; 

&#8226; 

extent and efficiency of our professional services; 

&#8226; 

ability to offer multiple channels of engagement; and 

&#8226; 

size and financial stability of operations. 

We believe we currently compete effectively with respect to each of the factors identified above. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. In addition, we require our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 

As of December 31, 2015, our intellectual property portfolio included nine registered and one &#32;pending U.S. trademarks, nine issued U.S. patents, five pending U.S. patent applications and one registered U.S. copyright. As of December 31, 2015, we also had four issued patents, eleven pending patent applications and fourteen &#32;limited &#32;trademark registrations outside the U.S. The expiration dates of our issued patents range from 2030 to 2034. In general, our patents and patent applications apply to aspects of our VCC cloud platform. 

We are also a party to various license agreements with third parties that typically grant us the right to use certain third-party technology in conjunction with our solution. We expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the 

functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. 

Seasonality 

We believe that there can be seasonal factors that may cause our revenues in the first half of a year to be relatively lower than our revenues in the second half of a year. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, 53% &#32;of our total revenues were generated in the second half of each year. We believe that this is due to the general increase in customer support and marketing and sales activities leading up to, and during, the holiday season. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 692 &#32;full-time employees, including 307 &#32;in technology and operations, 167 &#32;in research and development, 131 &#32;in sales and marketing, and 87 &#32;in general and administrative. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of these, 190 &#32;were located in the Philippines and 127 &#32;in Russia. We believe that our employee relations are good and we have never experienced any work stoppages. 

Regulatory 

The following summarizes important, but not all, federal and state regulations that could impact our operations. Federal and state regulations are subject to judicial review, administrative revision and statutory changes through legislation that could materially affect how we and others in this industry operate. 

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 vests the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) with jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services, while preserving state and local jurisdiction over many aspects of these services. As a result, telecommunications services are regulated at both the federal and state levels in the United States. 

We are classified as a telecommunications service provider for federal regulatory purposes. Since our business is regulated by the FCC, we are subject to existing or potential FCC regulations relating to privacy, disability access, porting of numbers, contributions to the federal Universal Service Fund and related funds (&#8220;USF&#8221;) and other requirements. If we do not comply with FCC rules and regulations, we could be subject to FCC enforcement actions, fines, loss of operating authority and possibly restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell our services to clients and could harm our business and results of operations. 

We must comply with numerous federal regulations, including: 

&#8226; 

the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (&#8220;CALEA&#8221;), which requires covered entities to assist law enforcement in undertaking electronic surveillance; 

&#8226; 

contributions to the USF, which requires that we pay a percentage of our revenues resulting from the provision of interstate telecommunications services to support certain federal programs; 

&#8226; 

payment of annual FCC regulatory fees based on our interstate and international revenues; 

&#8226; 

rules pertaining to access to our services by people with disabilities and contributions to the Telecommunications Relay Services fund; and 

&#8226; 

FCC rules regarding Customer Proprietary Network Information (&#8220;CPNI&#8221;), which require that we not use such information without customer approval, subject to certain exceptions. 

In addition, we must make contributions and other payments on our usage-based fees to state and local governmental entities. The tax and fee structure for communications services such as ours is complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation. If taxing and regulatory authorities enact new rules or regulations or expand their interpretations of existing rules and regulations, we could incur additional liabilities. In addition, the collection of additional taxes, fees or surcharges in the future could increase our prices or reduce our profit margins. Compliance with these regulations may also make us less competitive with those competitors who are not subject to, or choose not to comply with, these regulations. See Note 11 &#32;of the notes to consolidated financial statements under ITEM 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of our liabilities related to USF matters. 

The FCC and a number of states are considering reform or other modifications to USF programs. These include which companies should contribute, how those contributions should be assessed and how the administration of the system can be improved. In addition, a number of states are actively considering extending their regulatory 

regimes. Any such changes could affect the way in which we comply with our regulatory obligations and could increase our regulatory costs and expenses. 

As we expand internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our services. Regulation of the solutions we provide outside the U.S. varies from country to country, is often unclear, and may be more onerous than those imposed on our services in the U.S. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could harm the use or cost of our solution in international locations. 

The legislative and regulatory scheme for telecommunications service providers and other solutions we provide will continue to evolve and can be expected to change the competitive environment for these services. It is not possible to predict how such evolution and changes will affect our business or our industry. If we do not comply with current or future rules or regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial additional fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our service offerings, exit certain markets, accept lower margins or raise the price of our services, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Regulatory Matters&#8221; under ITEM 1A of this Form 10-K for more information.
