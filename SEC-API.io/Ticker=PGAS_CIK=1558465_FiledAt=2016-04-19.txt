Description of Business 

&#160; 

800 Commerce 

&#160;

800 Commerce commenced revenue producing activities based on the marketing of credit processing services in March 2010. 800 Commerce generates revenue from the marketing of credit processing services by way of fees received from merchant payment processing service providers on whose behalf the Company brokers their processing services. On August 1, 2012, 800 Commerce began to receive additional revenue pursuant to a processing service provider&#8217;s assignment of a portion of its fee income under one or more of its service contracts in exchange for the issuance of 500,000 shares of our common stock.

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition to marketing credit card processing services, 800 Commerce also developed on-line portals and mobile applications offering directories of professional service providers. The initial on-line portal and mobile application dedicated to a directory of medical doctors is completed, however, the Company has not commenced revenue producing operations by way of the medical directory. As a result of the acquisition of Petrogres, the Company intends to scale back and eventually terminate the credit card processing sector of its business operations.

&#160;

Petrogress 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Petrogres Co. Ltd. (&#8220;Petrogres), was incorporated in 2009 under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and has branch offices in Piraeus, Greece, the Republic of Cyprus and Ghana. At the time of incorporation, the business purpose was to sell crude oil and oil products in West Africa.

&#160;

Petrogres operates as an oil commodity integrate company in West Africa. Petrogres provides the supply of petroleum products which are then shipped by its affiliated tanker fleet and delivered to the buyers for local refinery in Ghana. The Company intends to expand this model of its operations and business to other continents. Petrogres&#8217; main operations are managed by an experienced team which is located at Petrogres&#8217;s main office in Piraeus, Greece. By combining regional market knowledge and excellent service to its customers, along with more than 25 years&#8217; experience in shipping and ship&#8217;s management, Petrogres has earned a reputation for reliably marketing and moving petroleum products primarily in West Africa. The Company&#8217;s near term goals for expansion are currently being explored with the Company exploring the potential for acquiring or purchasing or leasing newly built LNG vessels in US to be used for the supply and sea freight of US LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) exports.

&#160;

The Company operates primarily as a holding company for its three wholly-owned subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are as follows:

&#160;

Petrogres has as its primary business being a physical trader-supplier of LPFO (Light Petroleum Fuel Oil), refined oil products and other petrochemical commodities, by serving a key role as an integrate company (trade &#38; logistics) of the oil industry within West African and Mediterranean countries.

&#160;

Petronav Carriers LLC (&#8220;Petronav&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary, incorporated in Delaware in March, 2016, will primarily manage the day to day operation and handling of the tanker fleet it manages. Petronav is exploring the possibility of adding additional tankers under management. Petronav manages four tankers to transport the Company&#8217;s petroleum products from Nigeria to Ghana. The products are stored in Ghana and then sold to end user buyers. These products are refined by Platon refinery in Ghana, in partnership with the Company.

&#160;

Petrogress Oil &#38; Gas Energy Inc. (&#8220;Petrogress Energy&#8221;), also a wholly-owned subsidiary, was formed in Texas in December, 2015. Petrogress Energy is primarily focused on investigating the feasibility of acquiring oil fields in Texas so that the Company can expand its operations into the LNG market within the United States market. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s business structure allows Petrogress to control both oil sourcing and shipping. Petrogres also has created a base from which income from different sources is generated. As a result, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in West African markets.

&#160;

Petrogres has grown from 2012 through 2015 and management expects the trend to continue to grow. Since 2012, Petrogres has moved a total of approximately 800,000 barrels of LPFO oil and had gross revenues (unaudited) of approximately $65 million, as follows:

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Presently, the Company has eight employees in Greece, three in Ghana and one in Cyprus.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

International seaborne transportation of LPFO and other petroleum products is provided by two main types of operators: fleets owned by independent companies and fleets operated by oil companies (both private and state-owned). Many oil companies and other oil trading companies also operate their own vessels and transport oil for themselves and third-party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators. Competition for charters is intense and is based upon price, vessel location, the size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel, and the quality and reputation of the vessel&#8217;s operator.

&#160;

The Company will compete in the transportation of petroleum products with much larger companies that have significantly longer operating histories and are much better capitalized. Most of these other operators are larger in size and with more vessels either under management or owned. They may also operate in a larger geographical area than the Company does at present and have significantly more capital and other resources from which to conduct their operations and as a result, face less risk in their operations.
