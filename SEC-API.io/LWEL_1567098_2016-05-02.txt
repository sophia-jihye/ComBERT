 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Business of Company &#160;

&#160;

We were incorporated on January 2, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our principal executive offices are located at Level 8, Two Exchange Square, 8 Connaught Place Central, Hong Kong. We also maintain an office at 1790 Hughes Landing Blvd. Suite 400, The Woodlands, Texas 77380. Our telephone number is 281-668-8266. Our fiscal year end was February 28/29 but on February 11, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a change in the fiscal year end from a fiscal year ending on February 28 or 29 (as the case may be) to March 31, effective beginning with fiscal year 2016.

&#160;

Luckycom Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Luckycom, Inc, was incorporated in Hong Kong as Goldsans Capital (Hong Kong) Limited (&#8220;Goldsans&#8221;) on November 08, 2011. Goldsans&#8217;s name was changed to Wudor Capital Hong Kong Limited on May 22, 2012 and subsequently to Luckycom Limited on June 28, 2013. Luckycom Limited became our wholly-owned subsidiary on July 3, 2013.

&#160;

We plan to be in the business of marketing, distributing and selling pharmaceutical medicines in international tenders managed by World Health Organization-Geneva (WHO).

&#160;

On July 3, 2013, we entered into a license agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;), which was amended on July 30, 2013 and again on October 15, 2013, with Luckycom Pharma Pte. Ltd. (&#8220;Luckycom Pharma&#8221;) based out of Singapore and acquired the exclusive and worldwide rights to manufacture, have manufactured, distribute, sell, market and promote the antimalarial medicine Cosunate (artesunate-amodiaquine kit tablets). In consideration for the license, we paid Luckycom Pharma 500,000 shares of our common stock valued at $0.11 per share for the two year license. Luckycom Pharma is owned by our officer and director, Kingrich Lee, and as such, the Agreement is considered a related party transaction. The shares paid under the Agreement ultimately belong to Mr. Kingrich Lee through his company, Luckycom Pharma. Moreover, the value set at $0.11 per share was arbitrarily chosen, was not the result of an arm&#8217;s length valuation process and does not reflect our book value or any other objective criteria of value. The Cosunate license expired on July 2, 2015 and has not been renewed. 

&#160;

Luckycom Pharma started developing antimalarial drugs in 2005. At present, Luckycom Pharma has developed a range of antimalarial drugs that includes:

&#160;

&#160; 1. COSUNATE : Artesunate+amodiaquine tablets &#160;

&#160; 2. COBETER/ALIVE :Artemether-LUMEFANTRINE Tablets &#160;

Luckycom Pharma now is focusing on COBETER/ALIVE antimalarial drugs and pre-qualifying them under the WHO-Geneva antimalarial drug prequalification programme. Luckycom Pharma has obtained Food and Drug Administration clearance from India in September 2015 for COBETER /ALIVE , Artemether 20mg +Lumefantrine 120 mg Tablets, Artemether 20 mg +Lumefantrine 120 mg Dispersible Tablets and Artemether 80 mg + Lumefantrine 480 mg Tablets, We have not yet decided whether to license or acquire the COBETER/ALIVE intellectual property from Luckycom Pharma.

&#160;

Between June and August 2015, we raised a total of $420,000 through the issuance of 3,500,000 unregistered shares of the common stock pursuant to the exemption from registration afforded under Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) as the securities were sold to non-U.S. persons and in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering. This amount will only be sufficient for half a year and we will need to raise additional capital to achieve our objectives.

&#160;

The WHO revised the International Pharmacopeia and prequalification guidelines for antimalarial drugs from 2000 to 2015 and published the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 in June 2015. As a result, all antimalarial drug manufacturers must update their drugs to the latest compliance with WHO guidelines.

&#160;

Malaria 

&#160; 

Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. The parasites are spread to people through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, called "malaria vectors", which bite mainly between dusk and dawn.

&#160;

There are four parasite species that cause malaria in humans:

&#160;

&#8226; Plasmodium falciparum

&#8226; Plasmodium vivax

&#8226; Plasmodium malariae

&#8226; Plasmodium ovale.

&#160;

Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are the most common. Plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly.

&#160;

In recent years, some human cases of malaria have also occurred with Plasmodium knowlesi &#8211; a species that causes malaria among monkeys and occurs in certain forested areas of South-East Asia.

&#160;

Transmission 

&#160;

Malaria is transmitted exclusively through the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes. The intensity of transmission depends on factors related to the parasite, the vector, the human host, and the environment.

&#160;

About 20 different Anopheles species are locally important around the world. All of the important vector species bite at night. Anopheles mosquitoes breed in water and each species has its own breeding preference; for example some prefer shallow collections of fresh water, such as puddles, rice fields, and hoof prints. Transmission is more intense in places where the mosquito lifespan is longer (so that the parasite has time to complete its development inside the mosquito) and where it prefers to bite humans rather than other animals. For example, the long lifespan and strong human-biting habit of the African vector species is the main reason why more than 90% of the world's malaria deaths are in Africa.

&#160;

Transmission also depends on climatic conditions that may affect the number and survival of mosquitoes, such as rainfall patterns, temperature and humidity. In many places, transmission is seasonal, with the peak during and just after the rainy season. Malaria epidemics can occur when climate and other conditions suddenly favor transmission in areas where people have little or no immunity to malaria. They can also occur when people with low immunity move into areas with intense malaria transmission, for instance to find work, or as refugees.

&#160;

Human immunity is another important factor, especially among adults in areas of moderate or intense transmission conditions. Partial immunity is developed over years of exposure, and while it never provides complete protection, it does reduce the risk that malaria infection will cause severe disease. For this reason, most malaria deaths in Africa occur in young children, whereas in areas with less transmission and low immunity, all age groups are at risk.

&#160;

Symptoms 

&#160;

Malaria is an acute febrile illness. In a non-immune individual, symptoms appear seven days or more (usually 10&#8211;15 days) after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms &#8211; fever, headache, chills and vomiting &#8211; may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness often leading to death. Children with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults, multi-organ involvement is also frequent. In malaria endemic areas, persons may develop partial immunity, allowing asymptomatic infections to occur.

&#160;

For both P. vivax and P. ovale, clinical relapses may occur weeks to months after the first infection, even if the patient has left the malarious area. These new episodes arise from dormant liver forms known as hypnozoites (absent in P. falciparum and P. malariae); special treatment targeted at these liver stages is required for a complete cure.

&#160;

Who is at risk? 

&#160;

Approximately half of the world's population is at risk of malaria. Most malaria cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. However, Asia, Latin America, and to a lesser extent the Middle East and parts of Europe are also affected.

&#160;

Specific population risk groups include:

&#160;

&#8226; young children in stable transmission areas who have not yet developed protective immunity against the most severe forms of the disease; &#8226; non-immune pregnant women as malaria causes high rates of miscarriage and can lead to maternal death; &#8226; semi-immune pregnant women in areas of high transmission. Malaria can result in miscarriage and low birth weight, especially during first and second pregnancies; &#8226; semi-immune HIV-infected pregnant women in stable transmission areas, during all pregnancies. Women with malaria infection of the placenta also have a higher risk of passing HIV infection to their newborns; &#8226; people with HIV/AIDS; &#8226; international travelers from non-endemic areas because they lack immunity; &#8226; immigrants from endemic areas and their children living in non-endemic areas and returning to their home countries to visit friends and relatives are similarly at risk because of waning or absent immunity. &#160;

Diagnosis and treatment 

&#160;

Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease and prevents deaths. It also contributes to reducing malaria transmission.

&#160;

The best available treatment, particularly for P. falciparum malaria, is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).

&#160;

WHO recommends that all cases of suspected malaria be confirmed using parasite-based diagnostic testing (either microscopy or rapid diagnostic test) before administering treatment. Results of parasitological confirmation can be available in 15 minutes or less. Treatment solely on the basis of symptoms should only be considered when a parasitological diagnosis is not possible. More detailed recommendations are available in the Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria (Second Edition).

Antimalarial drug resistance 

&#160;

Resistance to antimalarial medicines is a recurring problem. Resistance of P. falciparum to previous generations of medicines, such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), became widespread in the 1970s and 1980s, undermining malaria control efforts and reversing gains in child survival.

&#160;

In recent years, parasite resistance to artemisinins has been detected in four countries of the Greater Mekong subregion: Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam . While there are likely many factors that contribute to the emergence and spread of resistance, the use of oral artemisinins alone, as monotherapy, is thought to be an important driver. When treated with an oral artemisinin-based monotherapy, patients may discontinue treatment prematurely following the rapid disappearance of malaria symptoms. This results in incomplete treatment, and such patients still have persistent parasites in their blood. Without a second drug given as part of a combination (as is provided with an ACT), these resistant parasites survive and can be passed on to a mosquito and then another person.

&#160;

If resistance to artemisinins develops and spreads to other large geographical areas, the public health consequences could be dire, as no alternative antimalarial medicines will be available for at least five years.

&#160;

WHO recommends the routine monitoring of antimalarial drug resistance, and supports countries to strengthen their efforts in this important area of work.

&#160;

The following information is taken from the WHO Fact Sheet : World Malaria Report 2015 (http://www.who.int/malaria/media/world-malaria-report-2015/en/) 9 December 2015 :

&#160;

This fact sheet includes key estimates from the World Malaria Report 2015. The report draws on data from 96 countries and territories with ongoing malaria transmission, and from 5 countries that have recently eliminated malaria.

&#160;

Global disease burden in 2015 

&#160;

According to the latest estimates from WHO, there were 214 million new cases of malaria worldwide in 2015 (range 149&#8211;303 million). The African Region accounted for most global cases of malaria (88%), followed by the South-East Asia Region (10%) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (2%).

&#160;

In 2015, there were an estimated 438 000 malaria deaths (range 236 000&#8211;635 000) worldwide. Most of these deaths occurred in the African Region (90%), followed by the South-East Asia Region (7%) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (2%)

&#160;

In 2015, the global burden of malaria remained heavily concentrated in 15 countries, mainly in Africa. Together, these countries account for an estimated 80% of global malaria cases and 78% of deaths. Since 2000, progress in reducing malaria incidence in these high burden countries (32%) has lagged behind that of other countries globally (53%).

&#160;

Trends in the scale-up of malaria interventions 

&#160;

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are highly effective against P. falciparum, the most prevalent and lethal malaria parasite affecting humans. Globally, the number of ACT treatment courses procured from manufacturers increased from 11 million in 2005 to 337 million in 2014. The African Region accounted for most (98%) manufacturer deliveries of ACTs in 2014.

&#160;

Progress in adopting and rolling out preventive therapies for children has been even slower. As of 2014, six of the 15 countries where WHO recommends preventive therapies for children under five have adopted the treatment as national policy. Only one country, Chad, has adopted the recommended preventive therapy for infants.

Cases averted and cost savings 

&#160;

An estimated 663 million cases of malaria have been averted in sub-Saharan Africa since 2001 as a direct result of the scale-up of three key interventions: ITNs, IRS and ACTs. An estimated 68% of cases were averted through the use of mosquito nets, 22% due to ACTs and 10% due to indoor spraying.

&#160;

Across Africa, the prevention of new cases of malaria attributable to malaria control activities saved an estimated US $900 million in case management costs between 2001 and 2014. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets contributed the largest savings, followed by ACTs and indoor spraying.

&#160;

Despite substantial costs savings, malaria has placed a heavy economic burden on health systems in Africa. Since 2000, the average annual cost of case management alone is estimated at nearly US$ 300 million. As malaria is concentrated in countries with comparatively low national incomes, the cost of treatment has been disproportionately borne by the most resource-constrained countries.

&#160;

WHO response 

&#160;

To address remaining challenges in global malaria control and elimination, WHO has developed the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030. Adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015, the strategy provides a technical framework for all endemic countries as they work towards malaria control and elimination.

&#160;

This Global Technical Strategy sets ambitious but achievable goals for 2030, including: reducing malaria case incidence by at least 90%; reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90%; eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries; preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free.

&#160;

To achieve these targets, annual funding for malaria will need to triple over the next 15-year period, from US$ 2.7 billion (current level of spending) to US$ 8.7 billion by 2030.

&#160;

Trends in the scale-up of malaria interventions 

&#160;

Between 2005 and 2014, a sharp increase in diagnostic testing for malaria was reported in the African Region: from 36% of suspected malaria cases in 2005 to 65% of suspected cases. Sales of RDTs reported by manufacturers rose from fewer than 50 million globally in 2008 to 314 million in 2014.

&#160;

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are highly effective against P. falciparum, the most prevalent and lethal malaria parasite affecting humans. Globally, the number of ACT treatment courses procured from manufacturers increased from 11 million in 2005 to 337 million in 2014. The African Region accounted for most (98%) manufacturer deliveries of ACTs in 2014.

&#160;

Our Business Strategy &#160; 

&#160; 

We licensed the antimalarial drug Cosunate from Luckycom Pharma from July 2013 to July 2015.

&#160;

We understand that Luckycom Pharma is planning to submit the antimalarial drug, COBETER (Artemeter-Lumefantrine ) 20/120 Dispersible tablets and COBETER 80/480 Tablets for WHO-Geneva prequalification

&#160;

&#160; -5- &#160; 

(table of contents) 

Instead for pursuing our original plan to prequalify Cosunate under the WHO prequalification program, we now plan to negotiate with Luckycom Pharma to either license or acquire the COBETER/ALIVE intellectual property from Luckycom Pharma and take over the qualification and acceptance of the drug for international public tenders through the prequalification program process with the WHO under the rules of the International Pharmacopoeia. There is presently no negotiated arrangement between us and Luckycom Pharma with regards to COBETER/ALIVE intellectual property nor is there any assurance that we will be successful in our negotiations with Luckycom Pharma.

&#160;

We are aware of only thirteen firms that are approved under the WHO prequalification program for all antimalarial drugs as of April 2016. While the Chinese have been using effective medicines for centuries to treat Malaria, like artemisinin, these drugs have only been used beyond China in the pharmaceutical industry in the last decade. ( http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/malaria-pro ). As of April 2016, we are aware that only Novartis Pharma AG has obtained WHO prequalification for Artemether-Luemfantrine 20/120 tablets and dispersible tablets and 80/480 tablets in three different strengths.

&#160;

Non-U.S. Regulations 

&#160;

Before our products can be marketed outside the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the relevant authorities in the country in which the products are marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval, and in certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

Current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) are the standards identified in order to conform to requirements by governmental agencies that control authorization and licensure for manufacture and distribution of drug products for either clinical investigations or commercial sale. GMPs identify the requirements for procurement, manufacturing, testing, storage, distribution and the supporting quality systems in order to ensure that a drug product is safe for its intended application. GMPs are enforced in the United States by the FDA, under the authorities of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and use the phrase &#8220;current good manufacturing practices&#8221; (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) to describe these standards. In our case, one of our contract manufacturer is located in India.

&#160;

Luckycom Pharma has, through its subsidiary, entered into an agreement with a third-party organization to handle the manufacturing, testing, and distribution of activities. The organization is located in India with MHRA(UK) compliant facilities, has extensive experience within the biologics space and with the production of clinical and commercial GMP supplies. Our strategy is to continue to leverage both our partner&#8217;s capabilities and our internal capabilities in order to build a supply chain that is reliable, flexible, and cost competitive.

&#160;

In the next twelve months, if we are able to obtain funding, we plan to work with this MHRA(UK) compliant facility manufacturer to start the process of retrofitting its facility to meet WHO standards. Assuming we are successful in negotiating a license for the COBETER/ALIVE intellectual property, we plan to manufacture COBETER for WHO-Geneva prequalification program, and also manufacture ALIVE 20/120 &#38; 80/480 for the African private market after drug registration in the target market.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

Given our stage of development, we have not yet established commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company. We plan to build up an international network after we achieve our financial targets.

&#160; &#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies, including Novartis Pharma AG, Mylan Laboratories Ltd, and Sanofi-Aventis Group. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our products are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products).

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

We do not have any employees, other than Mr. Kingrich Lee. We also engage a number of consultants.
