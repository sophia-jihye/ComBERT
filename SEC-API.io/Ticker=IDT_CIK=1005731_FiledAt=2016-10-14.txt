 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

We are a multinational holding company with operations primarily in the telecommunications and payment industries. 

&#160; 

Since our inception, we have derived the majority of our revenues and operating expenses from IDT Telecom&#8217;s businesses, with IDT Telecom&#8217;s revenues representing 99.2% of our total revenues in fiscal 2016. IDT Telecom&#8217;s primary businesses market and distribute multiple communications and payment services across four broad business verticals: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Retail Communications provides international long-distance calling products primarily to foreign-born communities worldwide, with its core markets in the United States; &#9679; Wholesale Carrier Services is a global telecom carrier, terminating international long distance calls around the world for Tier 1 fixed line and mobile network operators, as well as other service providers; &#9679; Payment Services provides payment offerings, including international and domestic airtime top-up and international money transfer; and &#9679; Hosted Platform Solutions provides customized communications services that leverage our proprietary networks, platforms and/or technology to cable companies and other service providers. &#160; 

Our Retail Communications vertical provides prepaid international long distance calling services primarily to foreign-born and underbanked consumers in the United States, with smaller retail operations serving customers in Europe, Asia, South America and Canada. Retail Communications offerings include our flagship &#8216;Boss Revolution&#8217; branded PIN-less international long distance prepaid calling offerings as well as traditional, disposable hard cards sold under a variety of brands. In the United States, the majority of our customers purchase Retail Communications offerings through one of our more than 35,000 Boss Revolution authorized resellers. These resellers are typically small, independent retailers serving foreign-born communities. Boss Revolution customers can also purchase calling services directly through our IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system, website (www.bossrevolution.com), or mobile app available free on both the iTunes App Store and on Google Play. 

&#160; 

Our Wholesale Carrier Services business terminates international long distance calls for our retail customers and for other telecommunications companies, service providers, and resellers around the world. Our wholesale telecommunications network is comprised of interconnections that link virtually every country and significant carrier in the world. 

&#160; 

Our Payment Services vertical includes international mobile top-up (IMTU) offerings sold through our retail network or directly from the Boss Revolution website and mobile app, as well as our Boss Revolution international money transfer and National Retail Solutions business. IMTU is sold under the Boss Revolution brand as well as through mobile operator top-up cards sold by Boss Revolution resellers. Our Boss Revolution international money transfer business includes remittances from the United States to 49 countries offered through certain Boss Revolution resellers as well as the Boss Revolution online/mobile platform. Our National Retail Solutions business provides point of sale (POS) terminals and related services, including consumer rewards programs, credit card processing and coupon program participation to independent retailers in the U.S. The Payment Services vertical also includes IDT Financial Services Ltd., our Gibraltar-based bank, that issues prepaid debit cards to program managers across the European Economic Area. 

&#160; 

Our Hosted Platform Solutions&#8217; vertical includes voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) based offerings including cloud based telephony and SIP Trunking services under the Net2Phone and Picup brands, and residential telephony services provisioned to cable television providers under the Net2Phone Cable Telephony brand. Hosted Platform Solutions&#8217; offerings are delivered through several channels including cable operators (Net2Phone Cable Telephony) value added resellers (VARs), service providers, telecom agents and managed service providers (MSPs). 

&#160; 

In addition, IDT Telecom operates a business that provides bundled local/long distance residential phone service in 11 states under the brand name IDT America. 

&#160; 

Outside of our core telecommunications business, we also hold commercial real estate including our headquarters building and associated garage in Newark, New Jersey and an operations facility in Piscataway, New Jersey.

&#160; 

We expect to continue making regular quarterly distributions commensurate with our cash generation and financial resources, business outlook and growth strategy. 

&#160; 

OUR STRATEGY 

&#160; 

History and Background 

Since our founding, we have focused on value creation by leveraging potentially disruptive telecommunications, payment and other technologies to challenge entrenched business models. Outside of our core businesses, we have sought to select and incubate promising early stage businesses and, in some cases, have sold those businesses or spun them off to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

In 2007 and 2008, in response to a long-term, industry-wide decline in the sale of prepaid, disposable calling cards, which was our dominant offering at the time, we initiated a fundamental restructuring of our businesses. We right-sized corporate overhead, reduced network costs at IDT Telecom, streamlined our operations, and refocused on the growth and profitability of our core telecommunications businesses. In 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2016, we spun off to our stockholders non-core businesses, CTM Media, Genie Energy, Straight Path Communications, and Zedge, respectively. In October 2014, we completed the sale of our interest in Fabrix, a network storage and processing technology business, to Ericsson for $69 million in cash as part of Ericsson&#8217;s purchase of Fabrix for $95 million. 

&#160; 

Within IDT Telecom, we have reduced the cost of our infrastructure while leveraging our VoIP expertise and large retail network to develop new products and services. We also sharpened our retail focus to provide high-quality, cost-effective communications and payment services primarily to foreign-born consumers. This is a rapidly growing demographic and a historically underserved market that includes significant numbers of unbanked and under-banked consumers. 

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

As part of our effort to meet the changing demands of our target demographic, in 2008 we launched Boss Revolution PIN-less, a pay-as-you-go international long distance voice service. The service grew rapidly and eventually overtook sales of our traditional, disposable prepaid calling cards. We believe that Boss Revolution PIN-less has become the nation&#8217;s leading pay-as-you-go international calling service. We subsequently developed and introduced complementary payment services over the Boss Revolution platform, including international and domestic airtime top-up, gift cards, domestic bill payment and an international money transfer service. These additions represent significant milestones toward our goal of offering a comprehensive suite of voice and payment products under a single, global brand and platform targeted to under-banked, foreign-born consumers. 

&#160; 

To simplify the Boss Revolution PIN-less calling experience and expand its reach, we introduced our Boss Revolution mobile app in 2013. The app is free to the consumer and is distributed through both the iTunes and Google Play app stores. In 2014, we deployed the Boss Revolution app for retailers. Our retail app enables a qualified individual in the United States with an Android or iOS smartphone to become a Boss Revolution retailer and to manage their Boss Revolution account virtually anywhere, anytime. We expect our retailer app to be replaced at the end of calendar 2016 and replaced with a Boss Revolution retailer portal that can accessed via the web browser on a mobile device. 

&#160; 

Leveraging the high volumes of traffic to certain overseas destinations generated by our retail business, we have long been a significant operator in the global wholesale telecommunications market, carrying and terminating international calling traffic on behalf of other telecommunications companies and call aggregators. More recently, we have maintained our leadership in the wholesale market by leveraging VoIP technology and broadening our offerings with different levels of service quality. 

&#160; 

Recent Strategic Developments 

&#160; 

In August 2015, our Board of Directors approved a plan to reorganize into three separate entities by spinning off two business units to our stockholders, one of which was Zedge, which we completed on June 1, 2016. The remaining components of the reorganization are subject to change as well as both internal and third-party contingencies, and must receive final approval from our Board of Directors and certain third-parties. We continue to advance the effort on the remainder of the reorganization. 

&#160; 

IDT Telecom 

&#160; 

IDT Telecom&#8217;s largest offerings including its Boss Revolution prepaid PIN-less calling services and wholesale termination business face intense competitive pressures on revenues and margins. In response, IDT Telecom is pursuing a multi-pronged strategy that includes: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Reducing the cost of operating our network, streamlining operations, and right sizing overhead; &#9679; Expanding our national network of 35,000+ Boss Revolution retailers; &#9679; Building the Boss Revolution brand through direct to consumer marketing, promotions, and rewards programs; &#9679; Bringing new communications and payment services to the Boss Revolution platform and mobile app to create new sources of revenue; &#9679; Utilizing our direct and indirect sales force to deepen market penetration in certain foreign-born communities, focusing on geographies and ethnic communities where we have not traditionally been a leading provider; &#9679; Building on the early success of our Net2Phone brand's enterprise offerings including Session Initiation Protocol, or SIP, trunking and hosted private branch exchange, or PBX, services; &#9679; Investing to expand our early-stage international money transfer business with a focus on increasing the number of originating agents in the United States and our direct to consumer efforts via mobile; and &#9679; Investing in our National Retail Solutions business which provides merchant service offerings through point of sale (POS) terminals enabling independent retailers to participate in national coupon and other consumer goods promotional offerings, offer rewards programs, and access additional POS network benefits. &#160; 

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION 

&#160; 

IDT TELECOM 

IDT Telecom is comprised of two reportable segments, Telecom Platform Services and Consumer Phone Service. Since our inception, we have derived the majority of our revenues and operating expenses from IDT Telecom&#8217;s businesses. In fiscal 2016, IDT Telecom had revenues of $1,484.8 million, representing 99.2% of our total consolidated revenues, and income from operations of $32.4 million, as compared with revenues of $1,581.3 million and income from operations of $28.3 million in fiscal 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

TELECOM PLATFORM SERVICES 

Our Telecom Platform Services segment, which represented 99.5% and 99.4% of IDT Telecom&#8217;s total revenues in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, markets and distributes multiple communications and payment services across four broad business verticals: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Retail Communications provides international long-distance calling products primarily to foreign-born communities worldwide, with its core markets in the United States; &#9679; Wholesale Carrier Services is a global telecom carrier, terminating international long distance calls around the world for Tier 1 fixed line and mobile network operators, as well as other service providers; &#9679; Payment Services provides payment offerings, including international and domestic airtime top-up and international money transfer; and &#9679; Hosted Platform Solutions provides customized communications services that leverage our proprietary networks, platforms and/or technology to cable companies and other service providers. &#160; 

During fiscal 2016, our Telecom Platform Services segment generated $1,477.9 million in revenues worldwide and income from operations of $31.2 million, as compared with revenues of $1,572.7 million and income from operations of $27.0 million in fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

Retail Communications 

Retail Communications&#8217; revenue was $672.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $735.0 million in fiscal 2015 (45.5% and 46.7% of Telecom Platform Services&#8217; revenue in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). 

&#160; 

The majority of Retail Communications&#8217; sales are generated by the Boss Revolution PIN-less international calling service. Other smaller lines of business contribute to Retail Communications sales, including (1) traditional, disposable prepaid calling cards sold under a variety of brand names both domestically and overseas, (2) private label and IDT branded prepaid and point of sale activated calling cards sold to large retailers, medium sized retail chains (e.g. supermarkets, drug stores), and smaller grocery stores and similar outlets, and (3) our PennyTalk international calling service. Other revenues generated using our Boss Revolution platform, including airtime top-up and international money transfer are reflected in the Payment Services vertical discussed below. 

&#160; 

Boss Revolution PIN-less allows users to call their families and friends overseas without the need to enter a personal identification number, or PIN. To place a call, a customer must first establish a Boss Revolution prepaid account. Boss Revolution customers can access our network by first dialing a local access or toll-free number. Our platform recognizes the user&#8217;s network-provided automatic number identification (ANI) and seamlessly links each call to the corresponding Boss Revolution account. Callers then enter their destination phone numbers. The dialing process is automated to provide one-touch dialing in the Boss Revolution mobile app. 

&#160; 

Boss Revolution customers&#8217; account balances are typically debited at a fixed rate per minute. In contrast to many competitors, Boss Revolution does not charge connection, usage or breakage fees. Boss Revolution per minute rates can vary by the destination country, city, and whether the destination is a landline or mobile phone. Rates are published on the Boss Revolution consumer website and within the Boss Revolution mobile app. In addition to per minute prepaid plans, Boss Revolution offers unlimited calling plans for a flat monthly fee to some destinations. 

&#160; 

Customers can add to, or top-up, their account balance at any Boss Revolution retailer using cash or a credit card. Customers with a credit or debit card can also add to their account balance directly by phone, online through the Boss Revolution consumer web site (www.bossrevolution.com), or through the Boss Revolution mobile app. 

&#160; 

In the United States, we distribute many of our retail products through our network of distributors that, either directly or through sub-distributors, sells to retail locations. In addition, our internal sales force sells Boss Revolution platform products directly to retailers. Also, the Boss Revolution mobile app is available for download through both the iTunes and Google Play stores. Distributors, our internal sales people and retailers typically receive commissions based on the revenue generated by each transaction. 

&#160; 

The Boss Revolution retailer portal enables retailers to create accounts for new customers, add funds to existing customer balances and execute sales transactions for the various products and services available on the portal. The Boss Revolution retailer portal also provides a direct, real-time interface with our retailers, resulting in a cost-effective and adaptable distribution model that can rapidly respond to changes in the business environment. 

&#160; 

The Boss Revolution platform allows us to target and promote services directly to customers and retailers, and to introduce and cross-sell offerings. For example, the successful launches of international and domestic airtime top-up over the Boss Revolution platform leveraged our existing capabilities and distribution network to expand the scope of services we provide to our customers. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In the United States, the Boss Revolution brand is supported by national, regional and local marketing programs that include television and radio advertising, online advertising, print media, and grass roots marketing at community and sporting events. In addition, we work closely with distributors and retailers on in-store promotional programs and events. 

&#160; 

Retail Communications&#8217; sales have traditionally been strongest in the Northeastern United States and in Florida because of our extensive local distribution network and their large foreign born populations. In addition to these geographic areas, we continue to grow distributor relationships and expand our retail network in other areas of the United States, including the Southwest and West Coast, where we historically have not had as strong of a market presence. 

&#160; 

Wholesale Carrier Services 

Wholesale Carrier Services&#8217; revenue was $555.1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $590.9 million in fiscal 2015 (37.6% and 37.6% of Telecom Platform Services&#8217; revenue in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). 

&#160; 

Wholesale Carrier Services terminates international telecommunications traffic in more than 170 countries around the world. Our customers include IDT&#8217;s Retail Communications business, major and niche carriers around the globe, mobile network operators, and other service providers such as call aggregators. For many of these customers, particularly the major carriers, we engage in buy-sell relationships, terminating their customers&#8217; traffic in exchange for terminating our wholesale and retail traffic with their customers. 

&#160; 

We offer competitively priced international termination rates at several quality levels. We are able to offer competitively priced termination services in part because of the large volumes of originating minutes generated by our Retail Communications business, our global platform powered by proprietary software, our team of professional and experienced account managers, and an extensive network of interconnects around the globe. 

&#160; 

IDT Telecom terminated 28.3 billion minutes in fiscal 2016, as compared to 29.3 billion minutes in fiscal 2015, making us one of the largest carriers of international long distance minutes worldwide. Wholesale Carrier Services accounted for 19.2 billion minutes and 19.4 billion minutes of the total IDT Telecom minutes in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

IDT Telecom has a significant number of direct connections to Tier 1 providers outside the United States, particularly Tier 1 providers in Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Tier 1 providers are the largest recognized licensed carriers in a country. Direct connections improve the quality of the telephone calls and reduce the cost, thereby enabling us to generate more traffic with higher margins to the associated foreign locales. We also have direct relationships with mobile network operators, reflecting their growing share of the voice traffic market. 

&#160; 

Termination rates charged by Tier 1 and other providers of international long distance traffic have been declining for many years. Nevertheless, termination rates charged to us by individual Tier 1 carriers and mobile operators can be volatile. Termination price volatility on heavily trafficked routes can significantly impact our minutes of use and wholesale revenues. However, because of the small margins on these routes, the resulting change in the Wholesale Carrier Services business&#8217;s underlying profitability is often not material. 

&#160; 

In addition to offering competitive rates to our carrier customers, we emphasize our ability to offer the high-quality connections that these providers often require. To that end, we offer higher-priced services in which we provide higher-quality connections, based upon a set of predetermined quality of service criteria. These services meet a growing need for higher-quality connections for some of our customers who provide services to high-value, quality-conscious retail customers. As of July 31, 2016, Wholesale Carrier Services had more than 3,000 customers. IDT Telecom has over 600 carrier relationships globally. 

&#160; 

Wholesale Carrier Services&#8217; revenue is generated by sales to both postpaid and prepaid customers. Postpaid customers typically include Tier 1 carriers, mobile network operators and our most credit worthy customers. Prepaid customers are typically smaller telecommunication companies as well as independent call aggregators. 

&#160; 

Payment Services 

Payment Services&#8217; revenue was $219.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $208.3 million in fiscal 2015 (14.8% and 13.3% of Telecom Platform Services&#8217; revenue in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). 

&#160; 

The majority of Payment Services&#8217; revenue is generated by international airtime top-up. Other products and services in this vertical include domestic airtime top-up, gift cards sold in the United States and Europe, domestic bill pay service, our international money transfer service and the operations of our Gibraltar-based bank. Payment Services&#8217; offerings leverage our platform capabilities, our distribution reach into foreign-born communities and our global reach to provide convenient and affordable offerings, mostly over the Boss Revolution platform. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our international airtime top-up products enable customers to purchase minutes for a prepaid mobile telephone in another country. They are sold both over our Boss Revolution platform and in hard card format. Our international airtime top-up offerings are focused on geographic corridors, such as the United States to various Central American countries, that tend to generate high volumes of business, and are part of a comprehensive product offering that includes product, marketing and distribution focused on those corridors. 

&#160; 

International remittances are a significant economic activity among our target market of foreign-born residents and other under-banked communities. To serve that market, we began to roll-out an international money transfer service over our Boss Revolution platform in 2013. Prior to launch, we obtained the requisite licenses including those required by nearly every state, formalized relationships with national and local banks in the United States, developed a compliance operation to comply with applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and assembled a disbursement network of banks, retailers, mobile money platforms and other points of payment overseas where beneficiaries can receive their transferred funds. Our international money transfer service is offered over the Boss Revolution platform, and like other payment services, utilizes our retail network and associated ability to serve unbanked customers. However, we expect that only a limited number of Boss Revolution retailers in the United States will eventually qualify to process international money transfer transactions. 

&#160; 

Revenues from international money transfer are derived from a per-transaction fee charged to the customer and from foreign exchange differentials. Although we offer lower promotional rates from time to time, including as an incentive for customers to try the service, we generally charge the standard industry rates. Transaction costs include commissions paid to the retail agent, payment to the international disbursing agent, banking, compliance, and foreign currency exchange costs. 

&#160; 

Payment Services also includes reloadable prepaid debit cards marketed across the European Economic Area and Bank Identification Number (BIN) sponsorship services offered by our Gibraltar-based bank. 

&#160; 

Hosted Platform Solutions 

Hosted Platform Solutions&#8217; revenue was $31.4 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $38.5 million in fiscal 2015 (2.1% and 2.4% of Telecom Platform Services&#8217; revenue in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively). 

&#160; 

Hosted Platform Solutions&#8217; revenue is generated primarily by VoIP products and services sold under the Net2Phone brand. Net2Phone&#8217;s channel-based business focuses primarily on the UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) enterprise market place. From a product perspective, Net2Phone continues to develop our Hosted PBX, SIP Trunking and other telephony cloud-based solutions. In fiscal 2016, the Net2Phone division successfully launched an alternate brand targeting the VSB (very small business)/business startup community with our self-serving, cloud pbx solution called Picup. In fiscal 2017, we expect to release new add-on features and functionality to the Picup brand and product set. 

&#160; 

IDT continues to optimize and improve its cable telephony platform to reduce the underlying costs of service and speed deployment of its efficiencies. 

&#160; 

International Operations 

Internationally, we are a leading provider of prepaid calling cards including both private label and IDT-branded calling cards, which are sold through an extensive network of thousands of independent retailers as well as through our own internal sales force. Additionally, we sell Boss Revolution PIN-less international calling and domestic and international airtime top-up and payment services in select global markets both through retailers and directly to consumers. Wholesale Termination and related wholesale services are marketed and sold globally through our internal wholesale team. 

&#160; 

In Europe, we market our Retail Communications products in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Austria, seeking to capitalize on the demographic opportunity presented by immigration from outside of Europe to these developed nations. Because the immigrant market is fragmented, and due to the large number of markets in which we compete, we offer over 470 different prepaid calling cards in Europe. In addition, we sell Boss Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile app, and direct-to-consumer web sites in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, we sell the Prime Card, a leading prepaid MasterCard through select retailers and online directly to consumers. 

&#160; 

Our operations in Europe also include Wholesale Carrier Services. We maintain our European corporate, Retail Communications and Wholesale Carrier Services operations in London, England. We also operate satellite offices in Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Greece.

Our European operations, including Wholesale Carrier Services and Retail Communications, generated $368.5 million of revenues in fiscal 2016, an increase from the $359.4 million of revenues generated during fiscal 2015. Our European operations&#8217; revenues constituted 24.9% of IDT Telecom&#8217;s revenues from continuing operations in fiscal 2016, as compared to 22.7% in fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

In Asia, we sell Retail Communications products in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Malaysia. In Hong Kong, we are one of the top providers of prepaid calling services to the Filipino, Indian and Indonesian populations, three of the largest overseas worker segments there. In addition, in Singapore, our Retail Communications products are a market leader to the Indian, Indonesian and Bangladeshi populations, which are among the largest ethnic segments in Singapore. We sell Boss Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile app, and direct-to-consumer web sites in Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. In Asia, we also sell postpaid services direct to consumers and small businesses. In fiscal 2016, IDT Telecom generated $45.4 million in revenues from our operations in the Asia Pacific region compared to $57.6 million in fiscal 2015. Our operations in Asia also include Wholesale Carrier Services. We maintain our Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

In the United States, we distribute Retail Communications and Payment Services products, including Boss Revolution PIN-less, domestic and international airtime top-up offerings, and prepaid calling cards primarily to retail outlets through our network of distributors or through our internal sales force. In addition, our private label calling cards as well as our IDT-branded calling cards are also marketed to retail chains and outlets through our internal sales force, and from time to time, we may utilize third-party agents or brokers to acquire accounts. We also market prepaid offerings, including Boss Revolution PIN-less and domestic and international airtime top-up, direct to the consumer via online channels including the Boss Revolution consumer website (www.bossrevolution.com) and mobile apps for iOS and Android. 

&#160; 

Net2Phone, our VoIP division, focuses on the channel marketplace by partnering with service providers, distributors, system integrators, telecom agents and master agents domestically and internationally. These partners utilize Net2Phone&#8217;s full suite of VoIP communication solutions - SIP Trunking, Hosted PBX, Broadband Telephony, and Mobile VoIP calling apps - allowing their enterprise and residential end users to capitalize on the growth, flexibility and cost advantages of IP-based calling. 

&#160; 

In Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, we are a leading provider of prepaid calling cards including both private label and IDT-branded calling cards, which are sold through an extensive network of thousands of independent retailers as well as through our own internal sales force. Additionally, we sell Boss Revolution PIN-less international calling and domestic and international airtime top-up in select markets both through retailers and directly to consumers. In Asia, we also sell postpaid services direct to consumers and small businesses. In the United Kingdom, we sell the Prime Card, a leading prepaid MasterCard through select retailers and online directly to consumers. Wholesale Carrier Services are marketed and sold through our internal wholesale sales team. In Canada, we sell Boss Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile app, and direct-to-consumer web sites. 

&#160; 

Telecommunications Network Infrastructure 

IDT Telecom operates a global network to provide an array of telecommunications and payment services to our customers worldwide using a combination of proprietary and third-party applications. Proprietary applications include call routing and rating, customer provisioning, call management, e-commerce sites, product web pages, calling card features, and payment services features. Proprietary applications provide the flexibility to adapt to evolving marketplace demands without waiting for third-party software releases, and often provide advantages in capability or cost over commercially available alternatives. 

&#160; 

The IDT Telecom core voice network utilizes VoIP and is interconnected, where needed, through gateways to time-division multiplexing, or TDM, networks worldwide. This hybrid IP/TDM capability allows IDT Telecom to interface with carriers using the lowest cost technology protocol available. To support its global reach, IDT Telecom operates voice switches and/or points of presence in the United States, Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. IDT Telecom receives and terminates voice traffic from every country in the world, including cellular, landline and satellite calls through direct and indirect interconnects. The network includes data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, which house equipment used for both our voice and payment services, with smaller points of presence in several other countries. It is monitored and operated on a continual basis by our Network Operations Center in the United States. More recently, we started to make use of one of the leading cloud providers to serve as host for some of our application infrastructure.

CONSUMER PHONE SERVICES 

Our Consumer Phone Services segment generated revenues of $6.9 million and income from operations of $1.2 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to revenues of $8.6 million and income from operations of $1.3 million in fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, we continued to operate the business in harvest mode-maximizing revenue from current customers while maintaining expenses at the minimum levels essential to operate the business. This strategy has been in effect since calendar 2005 when the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, decided to terminate the UNE-P pricing regime, which resulted in significantly inferior economics in the operating model for this business. We expect the Consumer Phone Services&#8217; customer base and revenues will continue to decline in fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

We currently provide our bundled local/long distance phone service in 11 states, marketed under the brand name IDT America. Our bundled local/long distance service, offered predominantly to residential customers, includes unlimited local, regional toll and domestic long distance calling and popular calling features. A second plan is available, providing unlimited local service with our long distance included for as low as 3.9 cents per minute. With either plan, competitive international rates and/or additional features can be added for additional monthly fees. We also offer stand-alone long distance service throughout the United States. 

&#160; 

At July 31, 2016, we had approximately 4,200 active customers for our bundled local/long distance plans and approximately 18,100 customers for our long distance-only plans, compared to approximately 5,100 and 22,700 customers, respectively, on July 31, 2015. Our highest customer concentrations are in large urban areas, with the greatest number of customers located in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. 

&#160; 

ALL OTHER 

Operating segments that are not reportable individually are included in All Other. On June 1, 2016, we completed the Zedge Spin-Off, which was a pro rata distribution of the common stock that we held in our subsidiary Zedge to our stockholders. In connection with the Zedge Spin-Off, each of our stockholders received one share of Zedge Class A common stock for every three shares of our Class A common stock, and one share of Zedge Class B common stock for every three shares of our Class B common stock, held of record as of the close of business on May 26, 2016. Zedge is listed on the NYSE MKT with the ticker symbol &#8220;ZDGE&#8221;. We received a legal opinion that the Zedge Spin-Off should qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The disposition of Zedge did not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation and accordingly, its assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows have not been reclassified. 

&#160; 

At the time of its spin-off, Zedge&#8217;s principal business consisted of providing one of the most popular content platforms for mobile device personalization including ringtones, wallpapers, home screen icons and notification sounds. Its smartphone app, available in Google Play and iTunes, has been installed over 215 million times and has averaged among the top 25 most popular apps in the Google Play store in the U.S. for the past six years. 

&#160; 

All Other also includes our real estate holdings, and other smaller businesses. Prior to its sale in October 2014, All Other also included Fabrix, a software development company offering a cloud-based scale-out storage and computing platform optimized for big data, virtualization and media storage, processing and delivery. The final sale price for 100% of the shares in Fabrix was $95 million in cash, excluding transaction costs and working capital and other adjustments. We owned approximately 78% of Fabrix on a fully diluted basis. Our share of the sale price was $69.2 million, after reflecting the impact of working capital and other adjustments. We recorded gain on the sale of our interest in Fabrix of $76.9 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, respectively.

&#160; 

On December 7, 2015, we approved an investment of up to $10 million in Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals (&#8220;Cornerstone), As of July 31, 2016, we funded $2.0 million of our potential $10 million investment in Cornerstone. On September 19, 2016, we funded the balance of $7.6 million, which was net of deductions for interim advances to Cornerstone as well as certain due diligence expenses related to the investment. 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, All Other generated $11.5 million in revenues and income from operations of $4.2 million, compared to revenues of $15.4 million and income from operations of $78.0 million, including gain on the sale of interest in Fabrix of $76.9 million, in fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

Included in All Other during fiscal 2016 were Zedge revenues of $9.5 million and income from operations of $2.3 million compared to $9.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2015. Prior to its sale, during fiscal 2015, Fabrix generated $4.2 million in revenues and income from operations of $0.9 million.

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

IDT Telecom 

&#160; 

Telecom Platform Services 

&#160; 

Retail Communications 

Like all international calling services, our Boss Revolution PIN-less service is subject to fierce competition, and we do not expect to continue to grow revenues and margins without a successful strategy and sound execution. While virtually any company offering retail voice services is a competitor of our Retail Communications offerings, we face particularly strong competition from Tier 1 mobile network operators who offer flat rate international calling plans, other PIN-less prepaid voice offerings, prepaid calling card providers, mobile virtual network operators (or MVNOs) with aggressive international rate plans, and VoIP and other &#8220;over the top&#8221; (or OTT) service providers. Outside the United States, we also compete with large foreign state-owned or state sanctioned telephone companies. 

&#160; 

In our view, our ability to compete successfully against these operators depends on several factors. Our interconnect and termination agreements, network infrastructure and least-cost-routing system enable us to offer low-cost, high quality services. Our extensive distribution and retail networks provide us with a strong presence in communities of foreign born residents, a significant portion of which purchase our services with cash. Our Boss Revolution brand is often highly visible in these communities and has a reputation for quality service and competitive, transparent pricing. Finally, we also offer synergistic payment services over the Boss Revolution platform that customers can conveniently access from their accounts. In our view, these factors represent competitive advantages. 

&#160; 

However, some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition, and are capable of providing comparable service levels and pricing through established brands. Consequently, our ability to maintain and/or to capture additional market share will remain dependent upon our ability to continue to provide competitively priced services, expand our distribution and retail networks, improve our ability to reach and sell to customers through mobile devices, develop successful new products and services to fit the evolving needs of our customers, and continue to build the brand equity of Boss Revolution. 

&#160; 

Wholesale Carrier Services 

The wholesale carrier industry has numerous entities competing for the same customers, primarily based on price, products and quality of service. 

&#160; 

In our Wholesale Carrier Services business, we participate in a global market place with: 

&#160; 

&#9679; interexchange carriers and other long distance resellers and providers, including large carriers such as T Mobile, AT&#38;T and Verizon; &#9679; historically state-owned or state-sanctioned telephone companies such as Telefonica, France Telecom and KDDI; &#9679; on-line, spot-market trading exchanges for voice minutes; &#9679; OTT internet telephony providers; &#9679; other VoIP providers; &#9679; other providers of international long distance services; and &#9679; alliances between large multinational carriers that provide wholesale carrier services. &#160; 

Our Wholesale Carrier Services business derives a competitive advantage from several inter-related factors: our Retail Communications business generates large volumes of originating minutes, which represents a desirable, tradable asset that helps us win return traffic and obtain beneficial pricing which we can offer in the wholesale arena; the proprietary technologies powering our wholesale platform and in particular, the software that drives voice over internet protocols enables us to scale up at a lower cost than many of our competitors; our professional and experienced account management; and our extensive network of interconnects around the globe, with the ability to connect in whichever format (IP or TDM) is most feasible. In aggregate, these factors provide us with a competitive advantage over some participants on certain routes. 

&#160; 

Payment Services 

The major competitors to Payment Services&#8217; offerings include: 

&#160; 

&#9679; international mobile operators, who seek to control more of their own distribution channel or create their own products that are directly competitive to international airtime top-up; &#9679; other distributors, who develop a more comprehensive product offering than our international airtime top-up offerings or aggressively discount their product offerings that are similar to our international airtime top-up offerings; and &#9679; international money transfer services such as Western Union and MoneyGram that target foreign born communities in the United States. &#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Hosted Platform Solutions 

Some of the major competitors to our UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service) offerings include other UCAAS and or hosted voice providers such as Vonage Business, Nextiva, and Ring Central. Due to their longevity in the space, these providers carry a more advanced product set including features such as video, chat, collaboration, and analytics. These competitors, in addition to possessing a more recognized brand, also support integration of their services with other well-known 3 rd -party vendors such as SalesForce, SugarCRM &#38; Google applications. 

&#160; 

Consumer Phone Services 

We offer long distance phone services to residential and business customers in the United States. We also offer local and long distance phone services bundled for a flat monthly rate in 11states. The U.S. consumer phone services industry is characterized by intense competition, with numerous providers competing for a declining number of wireline customers, leading to a high churn rate because customers frequently change providers in response to offers of lower rates or promotional incentives. 

&#160; 

The regional bell operating companies, or RBOCs, remain our primary competitors in the local exchange market. We are also competing with providers offering communications service over broadband connections using VoIP technology, such as cable companies and independent VoIP providers. Companies also provide voice telephony services over broadband Internet connections, allowing users of these Internet services, such as Vonage and Skype, to obtain communications services without subscribing to a conventional telephone line. Mobile wireless companies are deploying wireless technology as a substitute for traditional wireline local telephones. 

&#160; 

Due to changes in the U.S. regulatory environment that affected our cost of provisioning bundled local/long distance phone services and increased competition, we ceased marketing activities for this service, and as a result, our Consumer Phone Services business has declined significantly. 

&#160; 

REGULATION 

The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is intended to describe what we believe to be the most important, but not all, current and proposed international, federal, state and local laws, regulations, orders and legislation that are likely to materially affect us. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Telecom in the United States 

Telecommunications services are subject to extensive government regulation at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Any violations of the regulations may subject us to enforcement actions, including interest and penalties. The FCC has jurisdiction over all telecommunications common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services. Each state regulatory commission has jurisdiction over the same carriers with respect to their provision of local and intrastate communications services. Local governments often indirectly regulate aspects of our communications business by imposing zoning requirements, taxes, permit or right-of-way procedures or franchise fees. Significant changes to the applicable laws or regulations imposed by any of these regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Telecom by the Federal Communications Commission 

The FCC has jurisdiction over all U.S. telecommunications service providers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services, including the use of local networks to originate or terminate such services. 

&#160; 

Universal Service and Other Regulatory Fees and Charges 

In 1997, the FCC issued an order, referred to as the Universal Service Order that requires all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to universal service support programs administered by the FCC (known as the Universal Service Fund). In addition, beginning in October 2006, interconnected VoIP providers, such as our subsidiary Net2Phone, are required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. These periodic contributions are currently assessed based on a percentage of each contributor&#8217;s interstate and international end user telecommunications revenues reported to the FCC. We also contribute to several other regulatory funds and programs, most notably Telecommunications Relay Service, FCC Regulatory Fees, and Local Number Portability (collectively, the Other Funds). We and most of our competitors pass through Universal Service Fund and Other Funds contributions as part of the price of our services, either as part of the base rate or, to the extent allowed, as a separate surcharge on customer bills. Due to the manner in which these contributions are calculated, we cannot be assured that we fully recover from our customers all of our contributions. In addition, based on the nature of our current business, we receive certain exemptions from federal Universal Service Fund contributions. Changes in our business could eliminate our ability to qualify for some or all of these exemptions. As a result, our ability to pursue certain new business opportunities in the future may be constrained in order to maintain these exemptions, the elimination of which could materially affect the rates we would need to charge for existing services. Changes in regulation may also have an impact on the availability of some or all of these exemptions. If even some of these exemptions become unavailable, they could materially increase our federal Universal Service Fund or Other Funds&#8217; contributions and have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations and, therefore, on our ability to continue to operate profitably, and to develop and grow our business. We cannot be certain of the stability of the contribution factors for the Other Funds. Significant increases in the contribution factor for the Other Funds in general and the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund in particular can impact our profitability. Whether these contribution factors will be stable in the future is unknown, but it is possible that we will be subject to significant increases. 

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Interconnection and Unbundled Network Elements 

FCC rule changes relating to unbundling have resulted in increased costs to purchase services and increased uncertainty regarding the financial viability of providing service using unbundled network elements. As a result, starting in 2006, we placed our Consumer Phone Services business in &#8220;harvest mode,&#8221; wherein we seek to retain existing customers but do not actively market to new customers. 

&#160; 

We continue to negotiate interconnection arrangements with Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, or ILECs, generally on a state-by-state basis, for our Consumer Phone Services business as well as other businesses. These agreements typically have terms of two or three years and need to be periodically renewed and renegotiated. While current FCC rules and regulations require the incumbent provider to provide certain network elements necessary for us to provision end-user services on an individual and combined basis, we cannot assure that the ILECs will provide these components in a manner and at a price that will support competitive operations. 

&#160; 

Access Charges 

As a provider of long distance services, we remit access fees directly to local exchange carriers or indirectly to our underlying long distance carriers for the origination and termination of our long distance telecommunications traffic. Generally, intrastate access charges are higher than interstate access charges. Therefore, to the degree access charges increase or a greater percentage of our long distance traffic becomes intrastate, our costs of providing long distance services will increase. Similarly, as a local exchange provider, we bill access charges to long distance providers for the termination of those providers&#8217; long distance calls. Accordingly, as opposed to our long distance business, our local exchange business benefits from the receipt of intrastate and interstate long distance traffic. Under FCC rules, our interstate access rates must be set at levels no higher than those of the ILEC in each area we serve, which limits our ability to seek increased revenue from these services. Some, but not all, states have similar restrictions on our intrastate access charges. 

&#160; 

For nearly a decade, the FCC has had open regulatory proceedings in which it has considered reforming &#8220;intercarrier compensation,&#8221; which is a term that covers the payments that carriers bill and remit to each other-access charges and reciprocal compensation, generally-for the use of telecommunications networks to originate and terminate phone calls. On November 18, 2011, the FCC released a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking wherein it set forth a schedule which, over a period of several years, substantially reduces terminating access rates. Since we both make payments to and receive payments from other carriers for terminating long distance calls, the FCC&#8217;s action has the effect of reducing payments we receive from other carriers while also reducing our costs to terminate our long distance calls. The FCC has also raised the possibility - which it has yet to conclusively act upon - that it will reduce originating access charges in a similar manner. Due to the nature of IDT&#8217;s business, IDT pays, but does not bill originating access charges. At this time we cannot predict the effect future FCC actions may have upon our business. 

&#160; 

Customer Proprietary Network Information 

In 2007, the FCC increased its regulatory oversight of Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI. The FCC took this increased role in response to several high-profile cases of &#8220;pretexting,&#8221; which occurs when an individual secures, through deception, from a communications provider the private phone records of another person. We have a CPNI compliance policy in place and we believe we currently meet or exceed all FCC requirements for the protection of CPNI. However, we cannot be assured that we are in full compliance and if the FCC were to conclude that we were not in compliance, we could be subject to fines or other forms of sanction. 

&#160; 

Straight Path Spectrum LLC 

On September 20, 2016, we received a letter of inquiry from the Enforcement Bureau of the FCC requesting certain information and materials related to an investigation of potential violations by Straight Path Spectrum LLC (formerly a subsidiary of ours and currently a subsidiary of Straight Path) in connection with licenses to operate on the 28 GHz and 39 GHz bands of the Fixed Microwave Services. We intend to cooperate with the FCC in this matter and we are in the process of responding to the letter of inquiry. The FCC could seek to fine or impose regulatory penalties or civil liability on us related to activities during the period of ownership by us. Further, should the FCC impose liability on Straight Path, we could be the subject of a claim from Straight Path related to that liability. 

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulation of Telecom by State Public Utility Commissions 

Our telecommunications services that originate and terminate within the same state, including both local and in-state long distance services are subject to the jurisdiction of that state&#8217;s public utility commission. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, generally preempts state statutes and regulations that prevent the provision of competitive services, but permits state public utility commissions to regulate the rates, terms and conditions of intrastate services, so long as such regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of federal law. We are certified to provide facilities-based and/or resold long distance service in all 50 states and facilities-based and resold local exchange service in 45 states. In addition to requiring certification, state regulatory authorities may impose tariff and filing requirements, consumer protection measures, and obligations to contribute to universal service and other funds. Rates for intrastate switched access services, which we both pay to local exchange companies and collect from long-distance companies for terminating in-state toll calls, are subject to the jurisdiction of the state commissions. State commissions also have jurisdiction to approve negotiated rates, or establish rates through arbitration, for interconnection, including rates for unbundled network elements. Changes in those access charges or rates for unbundled network elements could have a substantial and material impact on our business. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Telecom&#8212;International 

In connection with our international operations, we have obtained licenses or are otherwise authorized to provide telecommunications services in various foreign countries. We have obtained licenses or authorizations in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In numerous countries where we operate or plan to operate, we are subject to many local laws and regulations that, among other things, may restrict or limit the ability of telecommunications companies to provide telecommunications services in competition with state-owned or state-sanctioned dominant carriers. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Internet Telephony 

The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is generally less regulated than traditional switch-based telephony within the United States and abroad and, in many markets, is not subject to the imposition of certain taxes and fees that increase our costs. As a result, IDT is able, in many markets, to offer VoIP communications services at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to traditional telephone services. However, in the U.S. and abroad, there have been efforts by legislatures and regulators to harmonize the regulatory structures between traditional switch-based telephony and VoIP. This could result in additional fees, charges, taxes and regulations on IP communications services that could materially increase our costs and may limit or eliminate our competitive pricing advantages. Additionally, several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. These efforts could likewise harm our ability to offer VoIP communications services. 

&#160; 

Money Transmitter and Payment Instrument Laws and Regulations 

Our consumer payment services offerings include money transfer and various network branded (also called &#8220;open loop&#8221;) prepaid card offerings. These industries are heavily regulated. Accordingly, we, and the products and services that we market in the area of consumer payment services, are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Banking laws and regulations; &#9679; Money transmitter and payment instrument laws and regulations; &#9679; Anti-money laundering laws; &#9679; Privacy and data security laws and regulations; &#9679; Consumer protection laws and regulations; &#9679; Unclaimed property laws; and &#9679; Card association and network organization rules. &#160; 

In connection with the development of our money transmission services and the expansion of our network branded prepaid card offerings, we have actively pursued our own money transmitter licenses. At July 31, 2016, we had received a money transmitter license in 45 of the 47 U.S. states that require such a license, as well as in Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., and had an application pending in one additional state. During the last quarter of fiscal 2016, New Mexico and South Carolina issued legislations that require money transmitter licenses, and we are in the process of applying for such licenses. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Other Businesses 

We operate other smaller or early-stage initiatives and operations, which may be subject to federal, state, local or foreign law and regulation. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain name registrations and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand names. All of our employees sign confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that the employee may not use or disclose our confidential information except as expressly permitted in connection with the performance of his or her duties for us, or in other limited circumstances. These agreements also state that, to the extent rights in any invention conceived by the employee while employed by us do not vest in the Company automatically by operation of law, the employee is required to assign his or her rights to us. 

&#160; 

We own approximately 100 trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications in the United States and at least 360 registrations and pending applications abroad. We protect our brands in the marketplace including the IDT, Boss Revolution and Net2Phone brands. Where deemed appropriate, we have filed trademark applications throughout the world in an effort to protect our trademarks. Where deemed appropriate, we have also filed patent applications in an effort to protect our patentable intellectual property. IDT Corporation owns 12 issued patents and 5 patent applications in the United States and 14 patents issued abroad with 4 patent applications pending abroad. 

&#160; 

We maintain a global telecommunications switching and transmission infrastructure that enables us to provide an array of telecommunications, Internet access and Internet telephony services to our customers worldwide. We have domestic and foreign patents and patent applications regarding our infrastructure and/or global telecommunication network for our international telecommunications traffic and the international traffic of other telecommunications companies. 

&#160; 

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 

&#160; 

Companies in the telecommunications industry and other industries in which we compete own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property claims against us grows. Although we do not believe that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. 

&#160; 

IDT Telecom 

In addition to IDT Corporation&#8217;s patents, our Net2Phone subsidiary currently owns 29 issued patents and has 3 pending patent applications in the United States. Net2Phone has 5 foreign issued patents, and no patent applications pending abroad. 

&#160; 

Net2Phone owns at least 15 trademark and service mark registrations and at least 2 pending applications in the United States. Net2Phone owns at least 115 trademark and service mark registrations and at least 2 pending applications in various foreign countries. Net2Phone&#8217;s most important mark is &#8220;NET2PHONE.&#8221; Net2Phone has made a significant investment in protecting this mark, and Net2Phone believes it has achieved recognition in the United States and abroad. Net2Phone is currently engaged in an international filing program to file trademark applications for trademark registrations of the mark NET2PHONE in a number of foreign countries.
