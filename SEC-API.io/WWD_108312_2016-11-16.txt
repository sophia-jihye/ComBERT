Markets and Principal Lines of Business 

We serve the aerospace, industrial and energy markets through our two reportable segments &#8211; Aerospace and Industrial . In the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we changed the name of our Energy segment to Industrial. The term &#8220;energy&#8221; is largely viewed as &#8220;oil and gas&#8221; and therefore was not representative of the broader markets we serve in this segment. Our customers require technological solutions to meet their needs for performance, efficiency, and reliability, and to reduce their costs of operation. 

Within the aerospace market, we provide systems, components and solutions for both commercial and defense applications. Our key focus areas within this market are: 

&#183; 

Propulsion and combustion control solutions for turbine powered aircrafts; and 

&#183; 

Fluid and motion control solutions for critical aerospace and defense applications. 

Within the industrial and energy markets, our key focus areas are: 

&#183; 

Applications and control solutions for machines that produce electricity utilizing conventional or renewable energy sources; and 

&#183; 

Fluid, motion, and combustion control solutions for complex oil and gas, industrial, and transportation applications. 

Additional information about our operations in fiscal year 201 6 and outlook for the future, including certain segment information, is included in &#8220;Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; Additional information about our business segments and certain geographical information is included in Note 20, Segment information and Note 21, Supplemental quarterly financial data (Unaudited) , to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8 &#8211; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221;

Customers 

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 201 6 , approximately 42 % of our consolidated net sales were made to our five largest customers. Sales to our five largest customers represented approximately 40 % of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 and &#160; approximately 39 % of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 201 4 . 

Sales to our largest customer, General Electric , accounted for approximately 17 % of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal year ended September 30, 201 6, 18% of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, and 15% of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. Our accounts receivable from General Electric represented approximately 14 % of total accounts receivable as of September 30, 201 6 and 15 % as of September 30, 201 5 . During fiscal year 2016 we entered into a strategic joint venture (&#8220;JV&#8221;) with General Electric Company (&#8220;GE&#8221;), acting through its GE Aviation business unit. The JV sells fuel systems for GE&#8217;s large engine programs. Fuel systems for GE large engine programs that we previously sold directly to GE are now sold to the JV, which in turn sells them to GE. No other customer represented greater than 10% of our total accounts receivable. We believe General Electric and our other significant customers are creditworthy and will be able to satisfy their credit obligations to us. 

The following customers account for approximately 10% or more of sales to each of our reporting segments for the fiscal year ended September 30, 201 6 .

We supply these customers with technologically innovative system and component solutions and align our technology roadmaps with our customers. We focus on responding to needs for reduced cost and weight, emission control and reliability improvements. 

We compete with numerous companies around the world that specialize in fuel and air management, combustion, electronic control, aircraft motion control, flight deck control, and thrust reverser products. Our competitors in aerospace include divisions of Eaton, Honeywell, Moog, and Parker Hannifin, and United Technologies Corporation Aerospace Systems (&#8220;UTC Aerospace Systems&#8221;) and its subsidiaries. In addition, some of our OEM customers are capable of developing and manufacturing similar products internally. Several competitors are also customers for our products, such as Honeywell, Parker Hannifin, and UTC Aerospace Systems. 

Our products achieve high levels of field reliability, which offers end users an advantage in life-cycle cost. We address competition in aftermarket service through responsiveness to our customers&#8217; needs, providing short turnaround times, greater performance such as longer time between repairs, and maintaining a global presence. 

Some of our customers are affiliated with our competitors through ownership or joint venture agreements. We compete in part by establishing relationships with our customers&#8217; engineering organizations, and by offering innovative technical and commercial solutions to meet their market requirements. As discussed above, during fiscal year 2016 we entered into a strategic joint venture with GE, acting through its GE Aviation business unit. The JV sells fuel systems for GE&#8217;s large engine programs. 

Industrial &#160; operates in the global markets for industrial turbines, industrial reciprocating engines, electric power generation systems, power distribution networks, and wind turbines. 

We compete with numerous companies that specialize in various engine, turbine, and power management products, and our OEM customers are often capable of developing and manufacturing similiar products internally. Many of our customers are large global OEMs that require suppliers to support them around the world and to meet increasingly higher requirements in terms of safety, quality, delivery, reliability and cost. 

Competitors include ABB, Emerson, Heinzmann &#160; GmbH &#38; Co., Hoerbiger, Invensys, L&#8217;Orange GmbH, Meggi t t, Robert Bosch AG, and Schweitzer Electric. OEM customers with internal capabilities for similar products include Caterpillar, &#160; Cummins , General Electric, Siemens and &#160; Wartsila. 

We believe we are a market leader in providing our customers advanced technology and superior product performance at a competitive price. We focus on developing and maintaining close relationships with our OEM customers&#8217; engineering teams. Competitive success is based on the development of innovative components and systems that are aligned with the OEMs&#8217; techno logy roadmaps to achieve future reliability, emission, efficiency, and fuel flexibility targets. 

Government Contracts and Regulation 

Portions of our business, particularly in our Aerospace segment, are heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (&#8220;NASA&#8221;), and the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Transportation. We also contract with similar government authorities outside the United States. 

The U.S. Government, and potentially other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts, or any government contracts under which we are a subcontractor, at their convenience, as well as for default based on specified performance measurements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be terminated for our default, the U.S. Government generally would pay only for the work accepted, and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government could also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. 

We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things: 

&#183; 

require accurate, complete and current disclosure and certification of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contracts; 

&#183; 

impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;), and therefore require robust systems to reconcile ; 

&#183; 

impose regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts; 

&#160;

&#183; 

impose manufacturing specifications and other quality standards that may be more restrictive than for non-government business activities; and 

&#183; 

restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes due to the regulations of the U.S. Government and foreign governments pertaining to the export of certain products and technical data. 

Sales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers utilizing Woodward parts and subassemblies, collectively represented 21 % of our sales for fiscal year 201 6 , 1 8 % of our sales for fiscal year 201 5 , and 17 % of our sales for fiscal year 201 4 . The level of U.S. spending for defense, alternative energy and other programs, and the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated, is subject to periodic congressional appropriation actions, and is subject to change, including elimination, at any time. 

U.S. Government related sales from our reporting segments for fiscal years 201 6 , 201 5 and 201 4 were as follows:

Seasonality 

We do not believe our sales, in total or in either business segment, are subject to significant seasonal variation. However, our sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to the immediately preceding quarter due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays and scheduled plant shutdowns for annual maintenance. 

Sales Order Backlog 

Our backlog of unshipped sales orders by segment as of October 31, 201 6 and 201 5 was as follows:

Our current estimate of the sales order backlog is based on unshipped sales orders that are open in our order entry systems. Unshipped orders are not necessarily an indicator of future sales levels because of variations in lead times and customer production schedules. 

Manufacturing 

We operate manufacturing and assembly plants in the United States, Europe, Asia and South America. Our products consist of mechanical, electronic and electromechanical systems and components. 

Aluminum, iron and steel are primary raw materials used to produce our mechanical components. Other commodities, such as gold, copper and nickel, are also used in the manufacture of our products, although in much smaller quantities. We 

&#160;

purchase various goods, including component parts and services used in production, logistics and product development processes from third parties. Generally there are numerous sources for the raw materials and components used in our products, which we believe are sufficiently available to meet current requirements. 

We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and efficiently managing our overall supply costs. We expect our suppliers to maintain adequate levels of quality raw materials and component parts, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support production of our various products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to protect our intellectual property and processes and to monitor and mitigate risks of disruption in our supply base that could cause a business disruption to our production schedules or to our customers. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, business continuity, quality, delivery and protection of our intellectual property and processes. 

Our customers expect us to maintain adequate levels of certain finished goods and certain component parts to support our warranty commitments and sales to our aftermarket customers, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support our customers&#8217; standard and customary needs. We carry certain finished goods and component parts in inventory to meet these rapid delivery requirements of our customers. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) adopted disclosure rules for companies that use tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold or their derivatives (collectively referred to as &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221;) in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements in the event the conflict minerals come or may come from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. The European Union is considering the imposition of similar reporting obligations. Our conflict minerals report for calendar year 2015 was filed with the SEC on May 31, 2016 . We may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we use and/or are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the conflict minerals used in our products. Further, due to the complexity of our supply chain, the implementation of the existing U.S. requirements and any additional European requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a number of parts contained in our products. Regardless, we have and will continue to incur costs associated with compliance, including time-consuming and costly efforts to determine the source of conflict minerals that may be used in our products. 

Research and Development 

We finance our research and development activities with our own independent research and development funds. Our research and development costs include basic research, applied research, component and systems development, and other concept formulation studies. 

Company funded expenditures related to new product development activities are expensed as incurred and are separately reported in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Across both of our segments, research and development costs totaled $ 126,170 in fiscal year 201 6 , $ 134,485 in fiscal year 201 5 , and $13 8,005 in fiscal year 201 4 . Research and development costs were 6.2 % of consolidated net sales in fiscal year 201 6 compared to 6. 6 % in fiscal year 201 5 and 6. 9 % in fiscal year 201 4 . See &#8220;Research and development costs&#8221; in Note 1, Operations and summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in &#8220;Item 8 &#8211; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

Aerospace is focused on developing systems and components that we believe will be instrumental in helping our customers achieve their objectives of lower fuel consumption, lighter weight, more efficient performance, reduced emissions, and improved operating economics. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of: 

&#183; 

aerospace turbine engine applications, which include commercial, business and military turbofan engines of various thrust classes, turboshaft engines and turboprop engines; 

&#183; 

electromechanical and hydraulic actuation systems for flight deck-to-flight surface control of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, and turbine engine nacelles, as well as guidance for weapon systems; and 

&#183; 

motion control components for integration into comprehensive actuation systems. 

The aerospace industry is moving toward more electric (&#8220;fly-by-wire&#8221;), lighter weight aircraft, while demanding increased reliability and redundancy. In response, we are developing an expanded family of intelligent flight deck control products (including throttle and rudder controls) with both conventional and fly-by-wire technology, as well as motor driven actuation systems. 

We collaborate closely with our customers as they develop their technology plans, which leads to new product concepts. We believe this collaboration allows us to develop technology that is aligned with our customers&#8217; needs and therefore, increases the likelihood that our systems and components will be selected for inclusion in the platforms developed by our customers. Further, we believe our close collaboration with our customers during preliminary design stages allows us to provide products that deliver the component and system performance necessary for our customers&#8217; products. 

Most technology development programs begin years before an expected entry to service, such as those for the next &#160; generation of commercial aircraft engines. Other development programs result in nearer-term product launches associated with 

&#160;

new OEM offerings, product upgrades, or product replacements on existing programs. Some of the major projects/programs we are developing are listed below. 

We develop ed the fuel system, air management, and actuation hardware for CFM International&#8217;s LEAP engine program, and actuation system, combustion system and oil system components for Pratt &#38; Whitney&#8217;s PurePower engine program. These programs target applications in the single aisle and regional aircraft markets with expected entry into service in the 201 6 to 2018 timeframe. Both the LEAP engine and the PurePower engine have been selected by Airbus as options to power its A320neo aircraft , which entered service in 2016 . In addition, the LEAP engine has been selected exclusively by Boeing for its 737 MAX and by Comac for its C919 aircraft. The PurePower engine has been selected exclusively by Bombardier for its CSeries aircraft, which also entered service in 2016, by Embraer for its EJets E2 aircraft family, and by Irkut for the MS-21 aircraft. 

During fiscal year 2016 we entered into a JV with GE, acting through its GE Aviation business unit. The JV sells fuel systems for GE&#8217;s large engine programs. The JV is developing the fuel system for the GE9X engine (which will power the Boeing 777X). We have been selected as the JV&#8217;s supplier of this fuel system. 

We are the selected supplier for the thrust reverser actuation system (&#8220;TRAS&#8221;) for the Boeing 737 MAX and the CFM LEAP-engined Airbus A320neo. W e are developing TRAS programs for the Boein g 777X and the Airbus A330neo. The A330neo is scheduled to enter service in 2018, and the 777X in 2020. 

We are currently developing the fuel system, air management, and actuation hardware for the Passport engine program, as well as TRAS for the integrated propulsion system. Passport is the next generation GE Aviation engine for the large business aviation market, and has been selected by Bombardier to power its Global 7000 and 8000 long-range business aircraft, expected to enter into service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. 

In addition, we develop ed sensor solutions for the Airbus A350 high lift system, an actuation sub-system for the Boeing 787-9 that improves fuel burn, flight deck components for the Bombardier CSeries and control and sensing solutions for the Boeing KC-46A refueling tanker boom subsystem. We are currently developing flight deck components for the Bombardier Global 7000 and 8000 aircraft. 

Industrial &#160; is focused on developing improved technologies, including integrated control systems and system components, that will enable our OEM customers to cost-effectively meet mandated emissions regulations and fuel efficiency demands, allow for usage of a wider range of fuel sources, increase reliability, reduce total cost of ownership, support global infrastructure growth, and safely distribute power on the electrical grid. 

Our efforts include research and development of technologies and products that improve combustion processes and provide the more precise flow of various fuels and gases in our customers&#8217; gas turbines and industrial reciprocating engines. We also develop electronic devices and software that provide improved control and protection of reciprocating engines, gas turbines, steam turbines, wind turbines, and engine- and turbine-powered equipment. Major development projects include high pressure common rail diesel fuel injection systems, comprehensive gas engine control systems, fuel flow control valves and actuators, and various other technologies. Our technologies help our OEM customers&#8217; engines, turbines, power generation, power distribution, compressor and other powered equipment operate more efficiently and more reliably. 

Employees 

As of October 31, 201 6 , we employed &#160; approximately 6,800 full-time employees of which approximately 1,700 were located outside of the United States. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good. 

Approximately 17 % of our total full-time workforce were union employees as of October 31, 201 6 , all of whom work for our Aerospace segment and are located in the United States . The collective bargaining agreements with our union employees are generally renewed through contract renegotiation near the contract expiration dates. The MPC Employees Representative Union contract, which covers 483 employees as of October 31, 201 6 , expires September 30, 2017. The Local Lodge 727-N International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreement, which covers 416 employees as of October 31, 201 6 , expires April 21, 2017. The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and Local No. 509 agreement, which covers 223 employees as of October 31, 201 6 , expires June 3, 2017. We believe that our relationships with our union employees and the representative unions are good. 

Almost all of our other employees in the United States were at-will employees as of October 31, 201 6 , and therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Our executive officers each have change-in-control agreements which have been filed with the SEC. 

Outside of the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction. 

&#160;

Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing 

We own numerous patents &#160; and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. Government has certain rights in our patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of certain government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes as allowed by law. 

Some of our intellectual property is not covered by patents (or patent applications) and includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. Such unpatented technology, including research, development and engineering technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented software, is important to our overall business and to the operations of each of our segments. 

While our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business or either of our segments would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. 

As of September 30, 201 6 , our Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $ 197,650 of net intangible assets. This value represents the carrying values, net of amortization, of certain assets acquired in various business acquisitions and does not purport to represent the fair value of our intellectual property as of September 30, 201 6 . 

U.S. GAAP requires that research and development costs be expensed as incurred; therefore, as we develop new intellectual property in the normal course of business, the costs of developing such assets are expensed as incurred, with no corresponding intangible asset recorded. 

Environmental Matters and Climate Change 

The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position. 

We use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, and may acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We believe that the risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. We are engaged in environmental remedial activities, generally in coordination with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives. When it is reasonably probable we will pay remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. In formulating that estimate and recognizing those costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies, or others, until such recovery is assured. Our accrued liability for environmental remediation costs is not significant and is included in the line item &#8220;Accrued liabilities&#8221; in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in &#8220;Item 8 &#8211; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; 

We generally cannot reasonably estimate costs at sites in the early stages of remediation. Currently, we have one site undergoing remediation . T here is no more than a remote chance that remediation costs at any individual site, or at all sites in the aggregate, will be material. 

Our manufacturing facilities generally do not produce significant volumes or quantities of byproducts, including greenhouse gases, that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment. We do not expect legislation currently pending or expected in the next several years to have a significant negative impact on our operations in any of our segments. 

Domestic and foreign legislative initiatives on emissions control, renewable energy, and climate change tend to favorably impact the sale of our energy control products. For example, our Industrial segment produces inverters for wind turbines and energy control products that help our customers maximize engine efficiency and minimize wasteful emissions, including greenhouse gases.
