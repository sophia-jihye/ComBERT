 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General Development of Business 

ConAgra Foods, Inc., a Delaware corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company," "we," "our" or us"), is one of North America's leading packaged food companies with recognized brands such as Marie Callender's&#174;, Healthy Choice&#174;, Slim Jim&#174;, Hebrew Nati onal &#174; , Orville Redenbacher's &#174; , Peter Pan &#174; , Reddi-wip &#174; , PAM &#174; , &#32;Snack Pack &#174; , Banquet &#174; , Chef Boyardee &#174; , Egg Beaters &#174; , Hunt's &#174; , and many other ConAgra Foods brands found in grocery, convenience, mass merchandise, and club stores. We also have a strong business-to-business presence, supplying frozen potato and sweet potato products as well as other vegetable, spice, and grain products to a variety of well-known restaurants, foodservice operators, and commercial customers. 

We began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-based businesses throughout our history. We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919 and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 1975. Over time, through various acquisitions and divestitures, we changed the make-up of our company and focused on growing our branded food businesses to become the leading food company we are today. Making this shift involved acquiring a number of consumer food brands such as Banquet &#174; , Chef Boyardee &#174; , Marie Callender&#8217;s &#174; , and Alexia &#174; . We have divested our Private Brands business, milling business, dehydrated and fresh vegetable operations, a trading and merchandising business, packaged meat and cheese operations, and poultry, beef, and pork businesses, among others. Growing our food businesses has also been fueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into adjacent categories. We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on our invested capital. 

In January 2013, we acquired Ralcorp Holdings, Inc. ("Ralcorp"), a manufacturer of private branded food. Since the acquisition of Ralcorp, we focused on addressing executional shortfalls and customer service issues intended to improve operating performance for the Private Brands business. However, after further review of the Private Brands business, we changed our strategic direction and divested the Private Brands business in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. 

On November 18, 2015, we announced our plans to separate ConAgra Foods, Inc. into two public companies, Conagra Brands and Lamb Weston. The transaction, expected to be structured as a spinoff of the Lamb Weston business to the shareholders of ConAgra Foods, Inc. in the fall of calendar 2016, is expected to be tax free to the Company and its shareholders. During late fiscal 2016 and early fiscal 2017, we announced that we had entered into separate agreements to separately sell our Spicetec Flavors &#38; Seasonings business and JM Swank businesses. Each of the transactions is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. All of these businesses are part of the Commercial Foods segment. 

In fiscal 2016, we also announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Chicago, Illinois beginning in the summer of calendar year 2016. We completed the relocation in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Our efficiency and effectiveness initiatives continue to be implemented with a high degree of customer focus, food safety and quality, and commitment to our people. 

Financial Information about Reporting Segments 

We report our operations in two reporting segments: Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods. The contributions of each reporting segment to net sales, operating profit, and identifiable assets are set forth in Note 21 &#8220; Business Segments and Related Information &#8221; to the consolidated financial statements. 

Narrative Description of Business 

We compete throughout the food industry and focus on adding value for our customers who operate in the retail food, foodservice, and ingredients channels. 

Our operations, including our reporting segments, are described below. Our locations, including manufacturing facilities, within each reporting segment, are described in Item 2, Properties. 

Consumer Foods 

The Consumer Foods reporting segment principally includes branded food sold in various retail channels primarily in North America. Our food products are sold in a variety of categories (meals, entrees, condiments, pasta, sides, snacks, and desserts) in various retail channels across frozen, refrigerated, and shelf-stable temperature classes. Major brands include: ACT II &#174; , Banquet &#174; , Blue Bonnet &#174; , Chef Boyardee &#174; , DAVID &#174; , Egg Beaters &#174; , Healthy Choice &#174; , Hebrew National &#174; , Hunt&#8217;s &#174; , Marie Callender&#8217;s &#174; , Orville Redenbacher&#8217;s &#174; , PAM &#174; , Peter Pan &#174; , Reddi-wip &#174; , Slim Jim &#174; , Snack Pack &#174; , Swiss Miss &#174; , Van Camp&#8217;s &#174; , and Wesson &#174; . 

Commercial Foods 

The Commercial Foods reporting segment includes commercially branded and private label food and ingredients, which are sold primarily to commercial, foodservice, restaurant, food manufacturing, and industrial customers. The segment's primary food items include: frozen potato and sweet potato items and a variety of vegetable, spice, and frozen bakery goods, which are sold under brands such as Lamb Weston &#174; &#32;and Spicetec Flavors &#38; Seasonings &#174; . 

Unconsolidated Equity Investments 

We have a number of unconsolidated equity investments. Our significant equity method investments include a milling business (see " Formation of Ardent Mills " below) and other domestic and international investments that produce and market potato products for retail and foodservice customers. 

Acquisitions 

In May 2015, we acquired Blake's All Natural Foods, a family-owned company specializing in all natural and organic frozen meals, including pot pies, casseroles, pasta dishes and other entrees. This business is included in the Consumer Foods segment. 

In July 2014, we acquired TaiMei Potato Industry Limited, a potato processor in China. The purchase included property and equipment associated with making frozen potato products. This business is included in the Commercial Foods segment. 

Discontinued Operations 

On February 1, 2016, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2015, we completed the disposition of our Private Brands operations to TreeHouse Foods, Inc. ("Treehouse"). The Private Brands assets and liabilities have been reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented prior to the divestiture and the results of operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. 

Formation of Ardent Mills 

On May 29, 2014, the Company, Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill"), and CHS Inc. ("CHS"), completed the formation of Ardent Mills, which combined the North American flour milling operations and related businesses operated through the ConAgra Mills division of ConAgra Foods and the Horizon Milling joint venture of Cargill and CHS. We reflected the operating results of our legacy milling business as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Our equity in the earnings of Ardent Mills is reflected in our continuing operations. 

General 

The following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments. 

ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded, private branded, and value-added consumer food, as well as foodservice items and ingredients. We use many different raw materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives, and the use of derivative instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption. 

We experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets. Our food items compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded food, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service, brand recognition, and brand loyalty. 

Demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. 

We manufacture primarily for stock and fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant. 

Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and are protected by registration or other means in the United States and most other markets where the related food items are sold. Some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 

Many of our facilities and products we make are subject to various laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the food safety and quality, sanitation, safety and health matters, and environmental control. We believe that we comply with such laws and regulations in all material respects and that continued compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position. 

Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 16% , 16% , and 17% &#32;of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. 

At May 29, 2016 , ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had approximately 20,900 &#32;employees, primarily in the United States. Approximately 36% &#32;of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements, approximately 31% &#32;are parties to collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire during fiscal 2017 . We believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good. 

Research and Development 

We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations that emphasize applied research and technical services directed at product improvement and quality control. In addition, we conduct research activities related to the development of new products. Research and development expense was $66.7 million , $70.4 million , and $86.0 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively.
