 ITEM 1. Business. &#160;

General Overview 

&#160;

We are a Delaware holding company that uses our subsidiaries&#8217; and variable interest entities&#8217; vertically- and horizontally-integrated production, distribution and sales channels to provide health and well-being focused plant-based products. Our products are only sold domestically in China. We utilize modern engineering technologies and biotechnologies to produce, among other products, Chinese herbal medicines, organic agricultural produce and specialized textiles. Our health and well-being focused plant-based products business is divided into three major segments:

&#160;

1. Processing and distributing traditional Chinese herbal medicine products as well as other pharmaceutical products. The companies of this segment, Ankang Longevity Group, operate 66 cooperative retail pharmacies throughout Ankang, a city in southern Shaanxi province, China, through which we sell directly to individual customers traditional Chinese medicinal products produced by us as well as by third parties. Ankang Longevity Group also owns a factory specializing in decoction, which is the process by which solid materials are heated or boiled in order to extract liquids, and distributes decoction products to wholesalers and pharmaceutical companies around China. This segment accounted for approximately 40% of our revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.

&#160;

2. Planting, processing and distributing green and organic agricultural produce as well as growing and cultivating yew trees ( taxus media ). We currently cultivate and sell yew mainly to large group and corporate customers, but do not currently process yew into Chinese or Western medicines. This segment is conducted through the Company&#8217;s variable interest entities: the Zhisheng Group, which comprises the following Chinese companies participating in our yew tree business: Shineco Zhisheng (Beijing) Bio-Technology Co. (&#8220;Zhisheng Bio-Tech&#8221;), Yantai Zhisheng International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd (&#8220;Zhisheng Freight&#8221;), Yantai Zhisheng International Trade Co., Ltd (&#8220;Zhisheng Trade&#8221;), Yantai Mouping District Zhisheng Agricultural Produce Cooperative (&#8220;Zhisheng Agricultural&#8221;), and Qingdao Zhihesheng Agricultural Produce Services, Ltd (&#8220;Qingdao Zhihesheng&#8221;). This segment accounted for approximately 48% of our revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.

&#160;

3. Developing and distributing specialized fabrics, textiles and other byproducts derived from an indigenous Chinese plant Apocynum Venetum , grown in the Xinjiang region of China, and known in Chinese as &#8220;Luobuma&#8221; or &#8220;bluish dogbane&#8221;. Our Luobuma products are specialized textile and health supplement products designed to incorporate traditional Eastern medicines with modern scientific methods. These products are predicated on centuries-old traditions of Eastern herbal remedies derived from the Luobuma raw material. This segment is channeled through the Company&#8217;s directly-owned subsidiary, Beijing Tenet-Jove Technological Development Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tenet-Jove&#8221;). This segment accounted for approximately 12% of our revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.

&#160;

We primarily market our health and wellbeing-focused products in China. At present, we do not sell any of our products in the United States or Canada. China&#8217;s domestic pharmaceutical and healthcare product market is fast-growing but, in our opinion, underdeveloped. We believe China&#8217;s healthcare sector has the capacity to develop even further. According to China&#8217;s National Health and Family Planning Commission, China&#8217;s healthcare spending in 2013 was only 5.5% of GDP, which is far below healthcare spending of developed countries. According to the World Bank, healthcare spending for 2012 for the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany was 17.9%, 9.4%, 11.7% and 11.3%, respectively. According to a 2015 report by Deloitte, healthcare expenditures in China are projected to grow at an average rate of 11.8% annually from 2014-2018, reaching $892 billion by 2018. From pharmaceuticals to medical products to general consumer health, China remains among the world&#8217;s most attractive markets, and by far the fastest-growing of all the large emerging ones. This growth is being driven by China&#8217;s aging population, increased incidence of chronic diseases, and a material increase in investment from both domestic and foreign corporations. The growth also reflects the Chinese government&#8217;s focus on healthcare as both a social priority (as witnessed in its late 2000s healthcare reforms) and a strategic priority (as witnessed in the 12 th five-year plan&#8217;s stated focus on growing the biomedical industry in the future).

History and Corporate Structure 

&#160;

Shineco, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 20, 1997 as Supcor, Inc. From 1997 to 2004, the Company&#8217;s only activities were organizational ones, directed at developing its business plan and raising initial capital. On December 30, 2004, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Tenet-Jove, a company operating in the fabrics and textile business organized under the laws of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on December 15, 2003, in exchange for shares of Shineco&#8217;s common stock. At that point, the sole operating business of Tenet-Jove then became that of the Company. On June 9, 2005, we changed our name to Shineco, Inc.

&#160;

Currently, Tenet-Jove, through a series of contractual relationships, effectively controls and manages:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Ankang Longevity Group&#8221;), which owns a controlling interest in the following Chinese companies participating in our traditional Chinese medicine business: Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical (Group) Traditional Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Ankang Longevity Decoction Pieces&#8221;), Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical Group Chain Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Ankang Longevity Chain&#8221;), and Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical Group Pharmaceutical Industry Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Ankang Longevity Industry&#8221;); and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; Zhisheng Group, which comprises the following Chinese companies participating in our yew tree business: Shineco Zhisheng (Beijing) Bio-Technology Co., Yantai Zhisheng International Freight Forwarding Co., Ltd, Yantai Zhisheng International Trade Co., Ltd, Yantai Mouping District Zhisheng Agricultural Produce Cooperative, and Qingdao Zhihesheng Agricultural Produce Services, Ltd. &#160;

The Company is also a majority shareholder of Tianjin Tenet Huatai Technological Development Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tianjin Tenet Huatai&#8221;), and it owns 49% of Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding Group Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Shaanxi Pharmacy Sunsimiao Drugstores Ankang Chain Co., Ltd. through a joint venture with Shaanxi Pharmaceutical Group Pai&#8217;ang Medicine Co. Ltd., a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical enterprise.

&#160;

Contractual Arrangements with Hongli Group and its Owners 

&#160;

We conduct our business through a combination of contractual arrangements with PRC operating companies and equity ownership of PRC subsidiaries. In some cases we have chosen to use contractual relationships because direct investment by foreign-owned companies like our Delaware company is prohibited or restricted. In other cases we have elected to do so in spite of being permitted to own such operating company directly. Where we operate our business through such contractual relationships, we are subject to risks related to such operation. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212; We rely on contractual arrangements with our variable interest entities in China for our business operations, which may not be as effective in providing operational control or enabling us to derive economic benefits as through ownership of controlling equity interests.&#8221;

&#160;

The principal regulation governing foreign ownership of businesses in the PRC is the Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue, effective as of April 10, 2015 (the &#8220;Catalogue&#8221;). The Catalogue classifies various industries into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Shineco is engaged in business in industries where direct foreign investment is expressly prohibited: the preparation of traditional Chinese medicines in small pieces ready for decoction.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Due, in part, to the regulations on foreign ownership of PRC businesses, neither we nor our subsidiaries own any equity interest in Ankang Longevity Group or the Zhisheng Group. The foregoing companies are referred to herein as the &#8220;Controlled Companies.&#8221; Instead, we control and receive the economic benefits of the Controlled Companies&#8217; business operations through a series of contractual arrangements. Tenet-Jove, each of the Controlled Companies and its shareholders have entered into a series of contractual arrangements, also known as VIE Agreements. The VIE agreements are designed to provide Tenet-Jove with the power, rights and obligations equivalent in all material respects to those it would possess as the sole equity holder of each Controlled Company, including absolute control rights and the rights to the assets, property and revenue of each Controlled Company. Based on a legal opinion issued by Dentons LLP to Tenet-Jove, the VIE agreements constitute valid and binding obligations of the parties to such agreements and are enforceable and valid in accordance with the laws of the PRC.

&#160;

Each of the types of VIE Agreements is described below and consist of, for each of Ankang Longevity Group and the Zhisheng Group, (a) exclusive business cooperation agreements, (b) timely reporting agreements, (c) equity interest pledge agreements, (d) exclusive option agreements, and (e) powers of attorney. As an overview, these agreements taken together are designed to allow our Company to manage the operations of each of the Controlled Companies and to receive all of the net income of such Controlled Companies in return therefor. To secure our interest in the Controlled Companies, the equity interest pledges and option agreements and the powers of attorney are designed to allow us to step in and convert our contractual interest into an equity interest in the event we determine that doing so is warranted. Finally, the timely reporting agreement is designed to ensure that we have timely access to the financial and other information from the Controlled Companies that we require in order to prepare regulatory and other filings.

&#160;

The following is a summary of the common contractual arrangements that provide us with effective control of our VIEs and that enable us to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from their operations.

&#160;

Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreements 

&#160;

Pursuant to substantially identical Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreements between each Controlled Company and Tenet-Jove, Tenet-Jove provides such Controlled Company with technical support, consulting services and other management services relating to its day-to-day business operations and management, on an exclusive basis, utilizing its advantages in technology, human resources, and information. Additionally, each Controlled Company has granted an irrevocable and exclusive option to Tenet-Jove to purchase from such Controlled Company, any or all of its assets, to the extent permitted under applicable PRC law. Tenet-Jove may exercise, at its sole discretion, the option to purchase from each Controlled Company any or all of such Controlled Company&#8217;s assets at the lowest purchase price permitted by PRC law. Should Tenet-Jove exercise such option, the parties shall enter into a separate asset transfer or similar agreement. Tenet-Jove shall own all intellectual property rights that are developed during the course of each Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. For services rendered to each Controlled Company by Tenet-Jove under the agreement to which such Controlled Company is a party, Tenet-Jove is entitled to collect a service fee calculated based on the time of services rendered multiplied by the corresponding rate, which is approximately equal to the net income of such Controlled Company.

&#160;

Each Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement shall remain in effect for ten years until it is extended or terminated by Tenet-Jove (which may be done unilaterally). Such agreements may only be terminated by the Controlled Companies upon gross negligence or fraud by Tenet-Jove. Tenet-Jove entered into an Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement with Zhisheng Bio-Tech, Ankang Longevity Group, and Qingdao Zhihesheng on February 24, 2014, December 31, 2008, and May 24, 2012, respectively, and with each of Zhisheng Freight, Zhisheng Trade, and Zhisheng Agricultural on June 16, 2011.

&#160;

Tenet-Jove is currently managing each Controlled Company pursuant to the terms of an Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. Pursuant to each such agreement, Tenet-Jove has absolute authority relating to the management of each Controlled Company, including but not limited to decisions with regard to expenses, salary raises and bonuses, hiring, firing and other operational functions. Although the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreements do not prohibit related party transactions, the audit committee of Shineco will be required to review and approve in advance any related party transactions, including transactions involving Tenet-Jove or any Controlled Company.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Timely Reporting Agreements 

&#160;

To ensure each Controlled Company promptly provides all of the information that Tenet-Jove and the Company need to file various reports with the SEC and other applicable regulatory authorities, a Timely Reporting Agreement was entered between each Controlled Company and Shineco on July 3, 2014.

&#160;

Under the Timely Reporting Agreements, each Controlled Company agrees that it is obligated to make its officers and directors available to Shineco and promptly provide all information required by Shineco so that Shineco can file all necessary SEC and other regulatory reports as required.

&#160; 

Equity Interest Pledge Agreements 

&#160;

Under the Equity Interest Pledge Agreements among each Controlled Company (other than Zhisheng Agricultural, which is a cooperative and thus has no equity interests that can be pledged), the shareholders of each such Controlled Company and Tenet-Jove, the shareholders pledged all of their equity interests in each such Controlled Company to Tenet-Jove to guarantee the performance of such Controlled Company&#8217;s obligations under the respective Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. Under the terms of each agreement, in the event that the Controlled Company or its shareholders breach their respective contractual obligations under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement to which they are a party, Tenet-Jove, as pledgee, will be entitled to certain rights, including, but not limited to, the right to collect dividends generated by the pledged equity interests. Each Controlled Company&#8217;s shareholders also agreed that upon occurrence of any event of default, as set forth in the applicable Equity Interest Pledge Agreement, Tenet-Jove is entitled to dispose of the pledged equity interest in accordance with applicable PRC laws. Each Controlled Company&#8217;s shareholders further agree not to dispose of the pledged equity interests or take any actions that would prejudice Tenet-Jove&#8217;s interest in the applicable Controlled Company.

&#160;

Each Equity Interest Pledge Agreement shall be effective until all payments due under the related Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement have been paid by the Controlled Company party thereto. Tenet-Jove shall cancel or terminate an Equity Interest Pledge Agreement upon a Controlled Company&#8217;s full payment of fees payable under its applicable Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement.

&#160; 

Exclusive Option Agreements 

&#160;

Under the Exclusive Option Agreements, shareholders of each of the Controlled Companies (other than Zhisheng Agricultural, which is a cooperative and thus has no equity holders) irrevocably granted Tenet-Jove (or its designee) an exclusive option to purchase, to the extent permitted under PRC law, once or at multiple times, at any time, part or all of their equity interests in each Controlled Company. The option price is equal to the capital paid in by the applicable Controlled Company shareholders subject to any appraisal or restrictions required by applicable PRC laws and regulations. The option purchase price shall increase in case the applicable Controlled Company shareholders make additional capital contributions to such Controlled Company.

&#160;

Each agreement remains effective for a term of ten years and may be unilaterally renewed at Tenet-Jove&#8217;s election.

&#160; 

Powers of Attorney 

&#160;

Under the Powers of Attorney, the shareholders of each Controlled Company authorize Tenet-Jove to act on their behalf as their exclusive agent and attorney with respect to all rights as shareholders of the respective Controlled Companies, including but not limited to: (a) attending shareholders&#8217; meetings; (b) exercising all the shareholder&#8217;s rights, including voting, that shareholders are entitled to under the laws of China and the Articles of Association, including but not limited to the sale or transfer or pledge or disposition of shares in part or in whole; and (c) designating and appointing on behalf of shareholders the legal representative, the executive director, supervisor, the chief executive officer and other senior management members of the respective Controlled Companies.

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Guarantee Agreement 

&#160;

As noted above, Zhisheng Agricultural is a cooperative and has no equity interests to pledge and no equity holders to grant options. Thus, in order to secure the obligations of Zhisheng Agricultural to pay certain service fees owing to Tenet-Jove under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement to which it is a party, it has entered into a Guarantee Agreement among Zhisheng Agricultural, Tenet-Jove, and Wang Qiwei, a member of the Zhisheng Agricultural cooperative dated June 16, 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee Agreement, Wang Qiwei has agreed to guarantee the payment of service fees under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement should Zhisheng Agricultural breach its obligation to do so.

&#160; 

Our Current Corporate Structure 

&#160;

Shineco, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 20, 1997 as Supcor, Inc. On December 30, 2004, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Tenet-Jove, a company organized under the laws of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on December 15, 2003, in exchange for restricted shares of Shineco&#8217;s common stock, and the sole operating business of Shineco then became that of its subsidiary, Tenet-Jove.

&#160;

Tenet-Jove, through a series of contractual relationships, effectively controls and manages the Zhisheng Group, comprising Zhisheng Bio-Tech, Zhisheng Freight, Zhisheng Trade, Zhisheng Agricultural, and Qingdao Zhihesheng, and Ankang Longevity Group, which substantially owns Ankang Longevity Decoction Pieces, Ankang Longevity Chain, and Ankang Longevity Industry. The Company is a majority shareholder of Tianjin Tenet Huatai.

&#160;

The Company also owns 49% of Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding Group, Ankang Longevity Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Shaanxi Pharmacy Sunsimiao Drugstores Ankang Chain Co., Ltd. through a joint venture with Shaanxi Pharmaceutical Group Pai&#8217;ang Medicine Co. Ltd., a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical enterprise.

&#160;

Our current corporate structure is as follows:

&#160;

&#160;

Our Products and Operations 

&#160;

Our health and well-being focused plant-based products business is divided into three major segments:

&#160;

&#160; 1. Processing and distributing traditional Chinese herbal medicine products as well as other pharmaceutical products. This segment is conducted by the Company&#8217;s VIE, Ankang Longevity Group. &#160;

&#160; 2. Planting, processing and distributing green and organic agricultural produce as well as growing and cultivating yew trees ( taxus media ). This segment is conducted through the Company&#8217;s VIEs, the Zhisheng Group. &#160;

&#160; 3. Developing and distributing specialized fabrics, textiles and other byproducts derived from an indigenous Chinese plant Apocynum Venetum , known in Chinese as &#8220;Luobuma&#8221; or &#8220;bluish dogbane&#8221;. This segment is channeled through the Company&#8217;s directly-owned subsidiary, Tenet-Jove. &#160;

The details of each business segment are described as follows:

&#160;

Ankang Longevity Group 

&#160;

The companies of this segment, Ankang Longevity Group, operates 66 cooperative retail pharmacies throughout Ankang, a city in southern Shaanxi province, PRC, through which we sell directly to individual customers traditional Chinese medicinal products produced by us as well as by third parties. This group also processes more than 600 kinds of Chinese medicinal herbal products such as medicines for bone and joint pain, arthritis, respiratory infections and insomnia, and distribute such products through an established Chinese domestic sales and distribution network, including more than twenty pharmaceutical companies and more than fifty hospitals throughout China. Ankang Longevity Group has recently established a joint venture with a large state-owned domestic pharmacy chain group, Shaanxi Pharmaceutical Group Pai&#8217;ang Medicine Co. Ltd. (&#8220;Shaanxi Pharmaceutical Group&#8221;). As part of the joint venture, Ankang Longevity Group contributed 13 retail pharmacies&#8212; operating as Sunsimiao Pharmacies&#8212; to the joint venture while retaining 66 retail pharmacies whereby Ankang Longevity Group acts as a franchisor. We also provide evaluation and diagnostic services by on-site doctors at pharmacies to support and drive our Chinese medicine product sales. The operations of this segment are focused in the northwest region of Mainland China, particularly Shaanxi province. This segment accounts for approximately 40% of our revenues.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Ankang Longevity Group has built a scalable decocting-free Chinese herbal medicine manufacturing facility that passed the Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;GMP&#8221;) certification in 2009 and was recognized as a Key Agricultural Industrialization Companies by the Shaanxi Provincial Government. The facility covers an area of over 4,000 square meters and is equipped with an advanced toxic herbal medicine treatment production line and herbal medicine testing instruments.

&#160;

Ankang Longevity Group has recently acquired land use rights to use 8,200 acres of selenium-rich farmland and woodland in Ziyang County, China to grow our Chinese medicine and other plant products.

&#160; 

Zhisheng Group 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s other VIEs, the Zhisheng Group, which includes Zhisheng Bio-Tech, Zhisheng Freight, Zhisheng Trade, Zhisheng Agricultural and Qingdao Zhihesheng, engage in the business of organic agricultural products, principally yew trees, as well as providing logistics services for all of the agricultural products we produce. Since 2013, this segment is focusing its efforts on the growing and cultivation of yew trees ( taxus media ), small evergreen trees that can be used for the production of anti-cancer medication as well as ornamental bonsai trees, which are known to have the effect of purifying indoor air quality. We currently cultivate and sell yew but do not currently process yew into Chinese or Western medicines. The entities composing the Zhisheng Group are currently focusing on researching, developing and cultivating organic produce, yew ecological products and other native plants. The operations of this segment are focused in the East region of Mainland China, principally Shandong Province, and in Beijing where we have newly developed over 100 acres of modern greenhouses for cultivating yew and other plants. This segment accounts for approximately 47% of our revenues.

&#160; 

Tenet-Jove 

&#160;

Through Tenet-Jove, the Company develops and distributes specialized textiles and health supplements derived from a native Chinese plant Apocynum venetum , grown in the Xinjiang region of China and known in Chinese as &#8220;Luobuma&#8221; or &#8220;bluish dogbane&#8221; and referred to herein as Luobuma. This plant has traditionally been used in China both internally and externally for centuries to treat high blood pressure, depression, dizziness, pain, insomnia, and other common ailments. The stems of Luobuma serve as raw material for fiber used in textile production, and the leaves serve as raw material for pharmaceutical drugs. This segment accounts for approximately 12% of our revenues.

&#160;

The companies of this segment, Tenet-Jove and Tianjin Tenet Huatai, specialize in Luobuma sourcing and developing Luobuma byproducts. With rich experience and broad channels in the Chinese domestic market, we believe that we are one of the leaders in Luobuma textile sales in China. This segment&#8217;s operations are focused in the north region of Mainland China, mostly carried out in Xinjiang and Tianjin. We are presently in preliminary negotiations to build a new facility in Hefei, Anhui Province, China to exploit our steam explosion Luobuma fiber production technology. Our Luobuma products are specialized textile and health supplement products designed to incorporate traditional Eastern medicines with modern scientific methods. These products are predicated on centuries-old traditions of Eastern herbal remedies derived from the Luobuma raw material.

&#160;

In addition to developing textile products, we expect to use our high-pressure steam degumming process to extract other Luobuma byproducts we intend to commercialize and distribute: flavonoids, xylooligosaccharides (XOS), edible pectin, fiberboard, and organic fertilizer. The traditional method of degumming Luobuma only produces Luobuma fiber, whereas our high-pressure steam degumming process produces these five additional Luobuma byproducts. Flavonoids are organic compounds widely distributed in plants, and flavonoid-rich Luobuma extract can be used in the manufacture of many pharmaceuticals. Xylooligosaccharides, or XOS, is a sugar that can be used as a food additive that provides various health benefits like lowering glucose levels. Pectin is a thickener and stabilizer used in food, beverages and cosmetics, as well as a gelling agent for jellies. Fiberboard is a type of engineered wood alternative that is made out of Luobuma fibers; it is used widely for furniture manufacturing and packaging.

Product Descriptions 

&#160; 

Traditional Chinese Medicines 

&#160;

Our Ankang Longevity Group develops and manufactures hundreds of Chinese medicinal herbal products and decoction pieces such as medicines for bone and joint pain, arthritis, respiratory infections, insomnia, as well as many other common ailments. We distribute such products through an established Chinese domestic sales and distribution network, including through more than twenty pharmaceutical wholesale companies and more than fifty hospitals throughout China, as well as through our own and cooperative retail pharmacies. In addition to distributing Chinese medicinal herbal products, we also distribute many popular Western medicines we purchase from outside parties through our wholesale and retail channels so that we can offer a good variety of products to meet customer demands. In the second quarter of 2013, this group entered the Pharmaceutical retailing industry through a joint venture with another large domestic pharmacy chain group, Shaanxi Pharmaceutical Group. Ankang&#8217;s main products include the following traditional Chinese medicines:

&#160;

&#8226; Polygonum cuspidatum or Japanese knotweed, which is ingested to treat colds, digestive diseases, hepatitis and Cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation); &#160;

&#8226; Salvia mint, which is ingested to improve microcirculation; &#160;

&#8226; Tianma, which is ingested to treat Rheumatoid arthritis; &#160;

&#8226; Eucommia, which is ingested for bone and join pain; &#160;

&#8226; Radix, which is ingested to treat respiratory infections; &#160;

&#8226; Schisandra shrub, which is ingested to treat insomnia; and &#160;

&#8226; Berberis shrub, which is used as a raw material for antibiotics. &#160; 

Yew Trees 

&#160;

Currently, through our Zhisheng Group VIEs, we sell ornamental yew trees and yew cuttings to third parties. We also rent ornamental yew trees to companies who desire the environmental benefits of natural plants in their workplaces. Until recently we were primarily engaged in the production, distribution and sale of agricultural products, including the planting and processing of organic fruits and vegetables, such as tomato, eggplants, string beans, peppers as well as certain popular fruits in China like blueberries and wine grapes, but those operations have been temporarily scaled back due to stiff competition and a change of our internal policy in favor of the expansion of our yew tree business.

&#160;

As our inventories of young yew trees mature, our long-term goals are particularly focused on the extraction of paclitaxel or taxol, which is derived from certain species of yew trees including those we grow. Taxol, a broad-spectrum mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy, can be extracted from mature yew trees. As a mitotic inhibitor, taxol adheres to rapidly dividing cancerous cells during mitosis (cell division) and interferes with the division process. It may suppress tumor growth through regulating microtubule stabilization, inducing apoptosis and adjusting immunologic mechanism. Taxol is also used for the prevention of restenosis, which is the narrowing of blood vessels. In the treatment of certain soft tissue cancers, such as breast cancer, taxol is given for early stage and metastatic breast cancer after combination anthracycline and cytoxan therapy and is also given as treatment to shrink a tumor before surgery. It can also be used together with a drug called Cisplatin to treat advanced ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, or &#8220;NSCLC.&#8221; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved taxol as the primary and secondary treatment for NSCLC. There are other generally accepted protocols for the use of taxol as a cancer drug alone or in combination with other drugs depending upon the diagnosis, staging and type of cancer, as well as a patient&#8217;s medical history, tolerances and allergies, among other relevant factors. Taxol is usually sold to large pharmaceutical companies to be used in their products, which can be used to treat patients with lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck cancer, and advanced forms of Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that in three to five years at the earliest, the yew trees we are cultivating at present will begin to mature to a point where taxol extraction could be possible. We intend to invest in extraction equipment and facilities, as well as to increase planting and growing of yew trees, upon the successful launch of our initial public offering.

&#160; 

Tenet-Jove Textiles 

&#160;

Our company&#8217;s scientists and other Chinese researchers have brought modern scientific methods to the study of Luobuma, and have determined that Luobuma fibers have an increased tendency to radiate light at the &#8220;far infrared&#8221; end of the light spectrum, with wavelengths measuring between 8-15 microns (referred to as &#8220;FIR&#8221;). Based on Chinese scientific studies some believe that Luobuma&#8217;s FIR-radiating qualities exert a positive effect on various functions of the human body, including cellular metabolism. For this reason, we have marketed and sold these products utilizing such technology. These products are popular with Chinese customers seeking the perceived benefits of traditional Chinese medicine.

&#160;

For example, according to a report by the College of Science of Tianjin University, tests conducted by the PRC&#8217;s National Institute of Metrology have reported that the radiance rate of far infrared light from Luobuma fiber is 84%, 2 to 4 times higher than that from cotton and other natural fibers. The same tests found that the FIR radiance rate from our proprietary bio-ceramic powder reaches 91%. Healthful benefits have been observed at radiance rate levels above 70%. Based on these observations about FIR radiance, we have developed textiles that our customers can wear and from which we believe they can receive those health benefits commonly associated with Chinese herbal remedies.

&#160;

Tenet-Jove first commercially developed the natural FIR-radiant properties of the Luobuma plant in 1997. We refer to this natural Luobuma fiber as a &#8220;Second Generation&#8221; FIR textile. The &#8220;First Generation&#8221; of FIR-radiant textiles initially became popular in China around 1989, when manufacturers learned to add 3% of a FIR-radiant inorganic material to synthetic fibers comparable to nylon or polyester. This &#8220;First Generation&#8221; FIR material employs a relatively low level of technology and has relatively few perceived or measurable health benefits. The &#8220;Second Generation&#8221; FIR textiles we have developed are softer, smoother and more breathable natural fibers that are not as prone to static electricity as the low technology &#8220;First Generation&#8221; FIR-radiant textiles.

&#160;

Our Luobuma fabrics have been a success in the Chinese domestic market and have also received numerous awards. The technology applied to our Luobuma-based FIR Therapeutic Clothing and Textile Products has received a &#8220;Special Golden Award&#8221; from the China National Intellectual Property Bureau at China&#8217;s National Patent and Brand Expo. Our products under the brand name of &#8220;Tenethealth&#174;&#8221; have also been honored with the title of &#8220;Consumer&#8217;s Favorite Products&#8221; by the Chinese Consumer Association.

&#160;

The fibers of natural Luobuma FIR materials can contain up to 32 medicinal compounds, many of which are familiar to practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, our processes for manufacturing Luobuma textiles produce a fabric that is smooth, air-permeable, and soft. By combining a product that is familiar to Chinese consumers seeking the benefits of traditional Chinese medicine with quality and comfort, we believe we are well positioned in the Chinese textile market.

Tenet-Jove Product Development 

&#160;

We have developed what we term a &#8220;Third Generation&#8221; of FIR textiles under a contract with the Institute of Process Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the leading scientific institutions in China. Our research and development has focused on adding nanotechnology enhancements to our Luobuma textile products, in which we use small-scale nanotechnology to embed or impregnate our Luobuma-fiber textiles with other FIR-radiant materials, bio-ceramic materials, or other Chinese herbal remedies. Using these nanotechnology methods, we have developed and marketed health-promoting textile goods that are impregnated with FIR-radiant materials or other Chinese herbal remedies, which are then absorbed through the wearer&#8217;s skin. We believe these &#8220;Third Generation&#8221; FIR textiles will better combine the health benefits of Luobuma with an even softer, more natural cotton-like fabric that will be popular with Chinese consumers.

&#160;

The Company presently produces approximately one hundred &#8220;Third Generation&#8221; FIR textile products. These textile products include:

&#160;

&#8226; Far Infrared bedding sets (including various pillows, comforters, and sheets); &#160;

&#8226; Far Infrared underwear, T-shirts, and socks; &#160;

&#8226; Far Infrared knee and shin pads, waist supports and other protective clothing; and &#160;

&#8226; Far Infrared body wraps or protectors (for the ankle, elbow, wrist, and knee). &#160;

All our textile products are made of Luobuma-based fibers and are impregnated with bio-ceramic powder, which contains various minerals such as halloysite. Both the fiber and the bio-ceramic powder are developed with the Company&#8217;s patented, proprietary techniques.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Production Facilities 

&#160; 

We have formed strategic alliances with several certified knitting and clothing manufacturers throughout China in order to produce our Luobuma products. We assign them limited manufacturing jobs and require certain conditions, including protecting our proprietary techniques and meeting our rigid quality standards. We are in preliminary negotiations to build a new facility in Hefei, Anhui Province, China to exploit our steam explosion Luobuma fiber production technology.

&#160;

In 2013, we began large-scale operations in newly leased, energy efficient greenhouses aggregating 50,000 square meters in Beijing and have temporarily scaled back our operations in our former greenhouses located in Shandong Province. At this time, we rent our greenhouses in Shandong Province to local farmers. Our new greenhouse facilities are used primarily for the cultivation of yew trees and other decorative plants and trees. These state-of-the-art facilities allow us to better regulate light, temperate, humidity and other conditions within the greenhouse as well as to significantly increase the number of plants that can be housed in a particular greenhouse footprint. To a lesser degree, we expect these new greenhouses will reduce our manual labor costs associated with our greenhouse operations by approximately 25%. Rather than competing on price, which has become increasingly difficult in the Chinese market, we expect that technological and productivity advances from our new greenhouses will improve our competitive position within our agricultural segment, but there can be no guarantee that we will experience such advances, or if we do, that such advances would improve our competitive position.

&#160;

Ankang Longevity Group has an approximately 4,000 square meter production factory and an approximately 2,000 square meter production facility in Minxing Village, Wuli Town, Hanbin District, Ankang City used for production of decoction pieces.

&#160; 

Our Research and Development 

&#160;

Our Research and Development Center for our products in Tianjin is owned by our subsidiary, Tenet-Jove. The center is managed by senior research fellows, who specialize in different but related scientific fields, such as biochemistry, electrical engineering, textile engineering, medical and clinical studies, and pharmaceuticals. We are engaged in research and development of new products under cooperation with universities and research institutions, including the Process Engineering Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Forestry, East China Textile University, Tianjin University, Tianjin Research Institute of Knitting. In addition, we have partnered with five textile mills to testing spin and weaving of Luobuma fiber. Since inception, we have spent more than $800,000 on Luobuma research and development and $300,000 on Chinese medicinal product research and development.

Our Strategy for Research and Development 

&#160; 

&#8226; To keep our products proprietary and patented; &#160;

&#8226; To focus on our core existing product lines: Chinese herbal medicines and pharmaceutical sales, yew cultivation, Luobuma-based products, and FIR technology; &#160;

&#8226; To commit to further development of our Luobuma byproducts, houpu magnolia products, and selenium-enriched herbs and plants; and &#160;

&#8226; To build strategic alliances with universities and scientific institutions, which will allow us exposure to advanced technologies, excellent researchers and scientists and we believe will lower the costs and timing of the development of new products. &#160;

Tenet-Jove specializes in developing Luobuma products and combining FIR technology with natural herbal medicines. We estimate that there are large supplies of Luobuma in China, especially Xinjiang Province. In China, Luobuma can grow as high as 3.6 meters. In the first year after planting, Luobuma can be harvested once during that year; thereafter, it can be harvested twice per year before or at the beginning of the flowering period in June and a second time around September. Currently, we believe China&#8217;s Luobuma supplies are largely undeveloped. The Company&#8217;s future success will depend on improving its techniques to industrialize Luobuma by developing new Luobuma-derived products such as improved Luobuma functional fiber and various Luobuma nutritional supplements, which can be marketed and distributed through the Company&#8217;s Ankang Longevity business segment.

&#160; 

High-Pressure Steam Degumming Process 

&#160;

We currently produce an extensive line of Luobuma-based textile products; we have an exclusive patent on a Luobuma fiber yarn spinning method. Large-scale production of Luobuma fiber products is generally difficult due to the limited yield of Luobuma fiber and the high cost of obtaining that fiber. The current mainstream technology used to produce Luobuma fiber mainly uses chemical agents to remove gum from Luobuma, which destroys Luobuma fiber and causes lower Luobuma fiber production and pollution and makes it very difficult to extract other valuable by-products. A central technical challenge is how to quickly and efficiently remove the gum and sap from the Luobuma plants so that only the natural fiber remains.

&#160;

To solve this technical challenge, in August 2006 we signed a technology development contract with the Institute of Process Engineering at the Chinese Academy of Science, one of China&#8217;s leading scientific institutes. Pursuant to our contract, we and the Institute of Process Engineering worked together to develop a high-pressure steam degumming process for the mass production of Luobuma fiber, as well as its byproducts, which we completed in 2008. A literal translation of the project name is &#8220;The Stream Steam Explosion Project.&#8221; Essentially, the project will develop a modern material engineering method for quickly blasting a large amount of high-pressure steam into a large container filled with raw Luobuma plants. The steam will remove the gum and sap and leave the fiber for use in textile production. The gum and sap and other Luobuma byproducts will be washed out with the steam and collected in a separate place for other uses.

&#160;

If we can successfully implement our high-pressure steam degumming process, we expect that our annual yield of Luobuma fiber can rise by over one hundredfold&#8212; from less than 200 tons to approximately 27,000 tons per year, and the cost of extracting the fiber will be reduced by approximately 50%. For example, the older method of production might require 150 laborers to produce one ton of Luobuma fiber in one day, whereas our high-pressure steam degumming process can utilize just 30 laborers to produce 15 tons of Luobuma fiber in one day. During the process, a certain amount of steam will be used, but unlike the traditional method of degumming, our high-pressure steam degumming process discharges no hazardous byproducts of any kind, because the fiber will be collected in one place, and the liquefied gum and sap and other material will be collected in another place to further separate flavonoids, xylooligosaccharides (XOS), and edible pectin through biological reverse osmosis membrane. The remaining material could be used to produce fiberboard and organic fertilizer, leaving no hazardous discharge or waste. We expect that this technique will be relatively simple and convenient for us to operate with our advanced technology. Luobuma fiber produced by this technique is more like cotton and more spinnable than before.

Ziyang Planting Base 

&#160;

Ankang Longevity Group has established long-term cooperative relationships with Shaanxi Chinese Medicine Research Institution, Shaanxi Normal University School of Life Science, and Shaanxi Chinese Medicine Association. Ankang Longevity Group has also entered into an agreement with the local government in Ziyang County for the use of an approximately 8,200 acre selenium-rich parcel of farmland and woodland for the cultivation of herbs and plants used in traditional Chinese medicine. Ankang Longevity Group has one of the largest Chinese medicine planting bases in China. The soil in Ankang City, especially in Ziyang County, which is located in Ziyang District of Ankang City, contains large quantities of selenium. Because the selenium content of raw plants is largely dependent on location and soil conditions, which can vary widely, the tea, traditional Chinese medicines and raw materials produced and cultivated in Ankang contain great amounts of selenium, which is a beneficial nutrient in foods and an important raw material for medicines. The innovative value of this project is the extraction and development of useful byproducts of medicinal houpu magnolia and eucommia. In China, traditionally only the barks of such trees have been used for medicinal purposes, and the remainder of the trees are treated as waste. We hope to utilize this parcel of farmland in Ziyang to extract valuable materials from the magnolia and eucommia we are cultivating while processing any waste into environmentally-friendly building materials, such as fiberboard.

Distribution Network 

&#160;

We sell our products through various distribution networks. Our traditional Chinese medicinal products and Western medicines are largely sold through either our wholesale customers or our Ankang retail pharmacies &#8212; 13 pharmacies operating as Sunsimiao Pharmacies and 66 pharmacies operated by third parties as Ankang Longevity Group Pharmacy cooperatives. Additionally, we sell decoction pieces on the Anhui Bozhou Chinese medicine transaction market, to medical materials company, such as Qianhe Pharmaceutical Industry Co. and to Chinese patent medicine factories, such as Wanxi Pharmaceutical Factory.

&#160;

Our Luobuma product distribution networks consists of four distributors who distributed our products to a total of approximately 21 outlets, including flagship stores, retail stores and sales counters. These distributors sell our products throughout mainland China. They all carried our proprietary brand name and &#8220;Tenethealth&#174;&#8221; trademark. We also sell our Luobuma textile products online through third party e-commerce websites, such as Taobao, Tmall and 360buy. Our yew trees and agricultural products are primarily sold through our sales personnel and group and institutional sales. In 2013, the Company placed its Luobuma, traditional Chinese medicine and yew products in a total of 144 retail stores and sales counters throughout China and on four e-commerce websites.

&#160;

Our sales and distribution strategy for our products focuses on expanding our distribution network of retail stores and sales counters into all major provinces and cities of China. We also plan to use our current distribution network to introduce our newly developed products into target markets more efficiently and effectively.

&#160;

All of these certified outlets operate independently, but they prominently display our trade names &#8220;Tenethealth&#174;&#8221; and &#8220;Tenet Bojian TM .&#8221; These independent retailers sell our products as well as other products.

&#160;

The location and number of retail stores and sales counters selling our products, including all sales outlets (both those connected with our major distributors (i.e., our most frequently used distributors) and other independent sellers) are listed below:

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We market Luobuma to consumers primarily by highlighting its unique characteristics&#8212; the material is soft like cotton, breathable like hemp and is smooth to the touch like silk, and its FIR-radiating qualities are believed by some to exert a positive effect on various functions of the human body. Very few other companies in China are involved with Luobuma fiber production, so we are chiefly able to market our products against products of natural and man-made fibers that do not have the perceived advantages of Luobuma. The small number of companies that are involved in Luobuma fiber production are still using the traditional, outdated methods of producing Luobuma. We are the only company using advanced technologies. Tenet-Jove&#8217;s overall marketing strategy includes:

&#160;

&#8226; Brand marketing strategy, primarily through media publicity, product- and market-oriented strategy; &#160;

&#8226; Distinguishing Luobuma as a high-end, technologically advanced native Chinese product; and &#160;

&#8226; Online advertising, which includes online advertisements appearing on the sites where we sell our products, as well as social media advertising, including Wechat, and direct e-mail solicitations. &#160;

Ankang Longevity Group&#8217;s overall marketing strategy of its traditional Chinese medicine products focuses on promoting the Ankang district&#8217;s place in traditional Chinese medicine history and its geographic location. First, Ankang City is located in the Han River area between Qinling Mountain and Ba Mountain. Because of its geographic location and favorable climate, it is the principal production location of the ancient Qin medicine, which dates from the Qin dynasty, the first imperial dynasty of China. This area contains more than 1,200 types of herbs and plants used in traditional Chinese medicine and is home to 176 of the 282 types of herbal medicine set forth in The Pharmacopoeia of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PPRC), compiled by the Pharmacopoeia Commission of the Ministry of Health of the PRC. The PPRC is the PRC&#8217;s official compendium of drugs, covering traditional Chinese and western medicines. Second, the soil in Ankang City, especially in Ziyang County, which is located in Ziyang District of Ankang City, contains large quantities of selenium. Because the selenium content of food is largely dependent on location and soil conditions, which can vary widely, the tea, traditional Chinese medicines and raw materials produced and cultivated in Ankang contain great amounts of selenium, which is a beneficial nutrient in foods and an important raw material for medicines. Ankang Longevity Group has entered into an agreement with the local government in Ziyang County for the use of an approximately 8,200 acre selenium-rich parcel of farmland and woodlands for the cultivation of herbs and plants &#8212; principally houpu magnolia and eucommia &#8212; used in traditional Chinese medicine. Selenium has also attracted attention because of its antioxidant properties; antioxidants protect cells from damage.

&#160;

Ankang Longevity emphasizes the following marketing strategies:

&#160;

&#8226; A focus on the excellent quality of its selenium Chinese herbal medicines; &#160;

&#8226; Establishment of a long-term supply relationships with pharmaceutical companies and hospitals nationwide; and &#160;

&#8226; Developing its Chinese herbal medicine wholesale market and e-commerce platform. &#160;

Finally, the Zhisheng Group emphasizes the following marketing strategies:

&#160;

&#8226; Focusing on the advanced growing conditions provided by our modern greenhouse operations and the potential pharmaceutical byproducts of yew, especially paclitaxel or taxol; and &#160;

&#8226; Brand marketing to focus on our yew&#8217;s brand positioning. &#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In October 2012, the Company, through its VIEs, Zhisheng Freight and Zhisheng Agricultural, entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party, Zhejiang Zhen&#8217;Ai Network Warehousing Services Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Zhen&#8217;Ai Network&#8221;), to invest RMB 14.5 million (Approximately $2.4 million) into the Tiancang Systematic Warehousing Project (&#8220;Tiancang Project&#8221;) operated by Zhen&#8217;Ai Network in exchange for a 60% equity interest in this project upon completion. The Tiancang Project is an online platform aiming to provide comprehensive warehousing and logistic solutions for various companies&#8217; e-commerce needs. The Company expects to increase its distribution channels through this platform as well as to benefit from boosting its own revenue by providing synergetic logistic and warehousing services using its existing facilities and a service team in the Eastern port city of Qingdao.

&#160;

Currently, the Company&#8217;s sales are generated through the following five major channels:

&#160;

1. Retail stores and sales counters. We mainly sell our Luobuma related products through sales counters and medicine through our pharmacy chain stores. &#160;

2. Sales to group or institutional customers. We mainly sell our organic agricultural products and yew trees to group or corporate customers. &#160;

3. Seminars and conferences. Because a majority of new consumers need to learn about our new products before buying them, it becomes very important and effective for us to organize or sponsor seminars and events to present healthcare knowledge while introducing and selling our products to new users. &#160;

4. Wholesale. We mainly sell our decocting-free Chinese herbal medicines to large Chinese medicine resellers and pharmaceutical companies. &#160;

5. E-commerce. We mainly sell the Luobuma related products through Tmall and Taobao to underdeveloped regions in China, Taiwan and Macau. We are currently one of only three certified online sellers of Luobuma textile products on China&#8217;s largest online sales platform, Tmall run by Alibaba. Selling through the Internet has become increasingly important to our sales in undeveloped regions and developed cities. &#160; 

The Market 

&#160;

We primarily market our health and wellbeing-focused products in China. At present, we do not sell any of our products in the United States or Canada. On the demand side, we believe that the following four forces drive market growth in all three of our business segments:

&#160;

1. The rapid growth of China&#8217;s economy, which has produced one of the largest groups of middle-class families in the world, with the largest collective purchasing power in the world. The Brookings Institution estimates that by 2030, over 70 percent of China&#8217;s population could be middle class, consuming approximately $10 trillion in goods and services. &#160;

2. The increase of China&#8217;s aging population. The China Census Bureau predicts that the majority of the China &#8220;baby boom&#8221; population (representing 40% of China&#8217;s total population) will be 65 or older by 2020, which represents over 500 million potential consumers of our pharmaceutical and healthcare products, the majority of which are sold to older customers. &#160;

3. Chinese people&#8217;s increasing attention and awareness to healthy and active lifestyles, especially in urban areas. &#160;

4. Chinese healthcare reforms. Due in part to national healthcare reforms in China, IMS Health has predicted that by 2015 China will surpass Japan to become the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world. &#160;

We believe China&#8217;s healthcare sector has the capacity to grow in the coming years. According to China&#8217;s National Health and Family Planning Commission, China&#8217;s healthcare spending in 2013 was only 5.5% of GDP, which is far below healthcare spending of other developed countries. According to the World Bank, healthcare spending for 2012 for the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany was 17.9%, 9.4%, 11.7% and 11.3%, respectively. Deloitte has projected that China&#8217;s healthcare spending could grow to nearly $900 billion by 2018. From pharmaceuticals to medical products to general consumer health, China remains among the world&#8217;s most attractive markets, and by far the fastest-growing of all the large emerging ones. This growth is being driven by China&#8217;s aging population, increased incidence of chronic diseases, and a material increase in investment from both domestic and foreign corporations.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

China&#8217;s healthcare market is being shaped by positive economic and demographic trends, further healthcare reform efforts, and the policies set forth in the government&#8217;s 12 th five-year plan. We believe that improvements in infrastructure, the broadening of insurance coverage, and government encouragement and support for innovation will have positive implications for us and other healthcare companies.

&#160;

Strong growth in the Chinese healthcare sector has been fueled by favorable demographic trends, continued urbanization throughout China, the overall Chinese economy&#8217;s expansion, and income growth (which encourages a greater awareness of and access to healthcare among Chinese consumers). It also reflects the Chinese government&#8217;s focus on healthcare as both a social priority (as witnessed in its late 2000s healthcare reforms) and a strategic priority (as witnessed in the 12 th five-year plan&#8217;s stated focus on growing the Chinese biomedical industry). According to a 2015 report by Deloitte, healthcare expenditures in China are projected to grow at an average rate of 11.8% annually from 2014 to 2018, reaching approximately $892 billion by 2018. From pharmaceuticals to medical devices to traditional Chinese medicine, almost every health sector has benefited.

&#160;

A 2012 McKinsey &#38; Co. report notes that China&#8217;s ten largest multinational pharmaceutical companies now have an aggregate total sales force numbering more than 25,000, even as many have downsized their sales forces in the United States and Europe. China has recently overtaken the United States in the total number of pharmaceutical medical sales reps employed by multinational corporations.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We compete with other top-tier pharmaceutical and healthcare companies in China. Many of them are more established than we are and have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we presently possess. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and a larger customer base. Those competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and customer requirements and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to customers, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some of our competitors have also developed similar products that compete with ours.

&#160;

Our most prominent competitors in China&#8217;s textile products market are primarily large-scale textile companies, such as Luolai Home Textile Co., Fuanna Bedding and Furnishing Co., Ltd., Violet Home Textile Co., and Shuixing Home Textile Co., Ltd, as well as Bauerfeind Sports and Albert Medical, makers of protective clothing products similar to our protective clothing products. Our most prominent competitors in our pharmaceutical sales market include Ankang City Zhenning Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd. and Zhenping County Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd. Our most prominent competitors in China&#8217;s agricultural market are Beijing Jinfu Yinong Agricultural Technology Group Co., Ltd. for vegetables and other produce and Shenyang Xincheng Garden Engineering Co., Ltd. for yew trees. In the pharmaceutical sales market, we believe that our competitive position is strong because Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding in which Ankang Longevity Group has a 49% ownership stake, is a participant in the Ankang municipal government&#8217;s &#8220;Three Unities of Medicine&#8221; program, which is designed to facilitate the purchase, sale and delivery of pharmaceuticals. The &#8220;Three Unities of Medicine&#8221; program refers to &#8220;unified procurement price, unified selling price, and unified logistics&#8221;. This project is promoted by the Shaanxi Government to regulate the price of medicines in the local market. Under the program, the Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding joint venture directly sells medicines to local institutional purchasers, like hospitals; these institutional purchasers are only permitted to purchase pharmaceuticals from selected preferred providers. After a bidding process, Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding, along with other two companies, were selected by the Ankang municipal government as preferred providers under the program. However, Shaanxi Pharmacy Holding is entitled to cover all counties and districts of Ankang City, and the other two providers only cover portions of Ankang City. This program is valid until 2020, and the participants are subject to an ongoing review of their qualifications by the local pharmaceutical supervision authority every three years till 2020.

&#160; 

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Ankang Longevity Group 

&#160;

Ankang Longevity Group competes within its traditional Chinese medicinal products and Western medicine wholesale and retail business primarily against Ankang City Zhenning Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd. and Zhenping County Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd., which conduct their wholesale pharmaceuticals business in the Ankang area, but Ankang Longevity Group has greater revenues than any of its competitors; its two main competitors&#8217; output value and sales combined are just one-third of Ankang Longevity Group&#8217;s. The Ankang Longevity Group has formed a new pharmaceutical company and chain of drug stores with two entities wholly owned by the state-owned Shaanxi Pharmaceutical Group that has resulted in a favorable market position in the Ankang area.

&#160;

Numerous competitors nationwide, including Ankang City Zhenning Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd. and Zhenping County Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces Co. Ltd., participate in the sale of Chinese medicinal herbs and Chinese medicine decoction pieces; among them are some high-profile and large-scale companies along with some companies that have huge production and storage capacity to influence the market price. Because we believe we can control the natural resources for producing selenium Chinese herbal medicines, the Group is especially focusing on those products in order to gain market share.

&#160; 

Zhisheng Group 

&#160;

There are dozens of companies planting and cultivating yew trees in China, some of which are large-scale companies. Shenyang Xincheng Garden Engineering Co., Ltd. is a large agricultural competitor whose main product is yew. Their nurseries have the most mature yew in northeast China, and the average age of their yew trees is more than eleven years old. Another competitor, Chongqing Jiangjin District Mansheng Agricultural Development Co., Ltd., has the biggest nursery for young plants in Southwest China. And Jingyin City Hengtu Town Green Industry Yew Base specializes in cultivating, planting, gardening, and technological development of yew. They were the first company to introduce taxus media yew trees in China.

&#160; 

Tenet-Jove 

&#160;

There are few viable competitors producing advanced technology textile products with health benefits like our Luobuma textile products. Principally, our competitors are those that market and sell traditional textile products, such as Luolai Home Textile Co., Fuanna Bedding and Furnishing Co., Ltd., Violet Home Textile Co., and Shuixing Home Textile Co., Ltd, as well as those companies that market and sell protective clothing, like Bauerfeind Sports and Albert Medical. Luobuma is native to China, thus our ability to source raw materials locally greatly enhances our competitive position in the Chinese market for high quality textile products with perceived health benefits.

Our employees are not represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages.

&#160;

In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we contributed approximately $128,763, $124,452 and $108,512, respectively, to employee social insurance. The effect on our liquidity by the payments for these contributions is immaterial. We believe that we are in material compliance with the relevant PRC employment laws.

Regulation of Work Safety 

&#160;

On June 29, 2002, the Work Safety Law of the PRC was adopted by the Standing Committee of the 9 th National People&#8217;s Congress and came into effect on November 1, 2002, as amended on August 27, 2009. The Work Safety Law provides general work safety requirements for entities engaging in manufacturing and business activities within the PRC. Additionally, Regulation on Work Safety Licenses, as adopted by the State Council on January 7, 2004 and effective on January 13, 2004, requires enterprises engaging in the manufacture of dangerous chemicals to obtain a work safety license with a term of three years. If a work safety license needs to be extended, the enterprise must go through extension procedures with authorities three months prior to its expiration. In addition, on May 17, 2004, the Measures for Implementation of Work Safety Licenses of Dangerous Chemicals Production was promulgated as implementing measures to the Regulation on Work Safety Licenses which provides that entities producing dangerous chemicals are required to obtain work safety licenses pursuant to specific requirements. Without work safety licenses, no entity may engage in the formal manufacture of dangerous chemicals.

&#160;

The Regulations on the Safety Administration of Dangerous Chemicals was promulgated by the State Council on January 26, 2002, and effective as of March 15, 2002.

Such companies can also be subject to fines. If criminal law is violated, the persons chiefly liable, along with other personnel directly responsible for such impropriety, shall be subject to relevant criminal liability.

&#160; 

Regulation of Foreign Currency Exchange 

&#160;

Foreign currency exchange in the PRC is governed by a series of regulations, including the Foreign Currency Administrative Rules (1996), as amended, and the Administrative Regulations Regarding Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), as amended. Under these regulations, the Renminbi is freely convertible for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for direct investment, loans or investments in securities outside the PRC without the prior approval of China&#8217;s State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Pursuant to the Administrative Regulations Regarding Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), Foreign Investment Entities may purchase foreign exchange without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange for trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions by providing commercial documents evidencing these transactions. They may also retain foreign exchange, subject to a cap approved by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, to satisfy foreign exchange liabilities or to pay dividends. However, the relevant Chinese government authorities may limit or eliminate the ability of foreign investment entities to purchase and retain foreign currencies in the future. In addition, foreign exchange transactions for direct investment, loan and investment in securities outside the PRC are still subject to limitations and require approvals from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.

&#160;

China has allowed for a more market-based exchange rate to influence the valuation of the Renmenbi versus global currencies, and supported devaluation consistently over the seven months prior to the date of this prospectus. To the extent any of our future revenues are denominated in Renmenbi or other currencies other than the United States dollar, we would be subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results since operating results are reported in United States dollars and significant changes in the exchange rate could materially impact our reported earnings.

Regulation of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions 

&#160;

In October 2005, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange issued the Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Fund-raising and Return Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies, or the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Notice 75, which became effective as of November 1, 2005, and was further supplemented by three implementation notices issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on November 24, 2005, May 29, 2007 and May 20, 2011, respectively. On July 4 th , 2014, SAFE amended it as Circular 37 (i.e., SAFE Circular on Issues Relating to the Administration of Foreign Exchange in Offshore Investment and Financing and Round-trip Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose Companies issued by SAFE on July 4, 2014). The State Administration of Foreign Exchange Circular states that PRC residents, whether natural or legal persons, must register with the relevant local State Administration of Foreign Exchange branch prior to establishing or taking control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas equity financing involving onshore assets or equity interests held by them. The term &#8220;PRC legal person residents&#8221; as used in the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Circular 37 refers to those entities with legal person status or other economic organizations established within the territory of the PRC. The term &#8220;PRC natural person residents&#8221; as used in the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Circular 37 includes all PRC citizens and all other natural persons, including foreigners, who habitually reside in the PRC for economic benefit.

&#160;

PRC residents are required to complete amended registrations with the local State Administration of Foreign Exchange branch upon: (i) injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise to the offshore entity, or (ii) subsequent overseas equity financing by such offshore entity. PRC residents are also required to complete amended registrations or filing with the local State Administration of Foreign Exchange branch within 30 days of any material change in the his shareholding or capital of the offshore entity, such as changes in share capital, share transfers and long-term equity or debt investments and merger and split activities.

&#160; 

Regulation on Dividend Distributions 

&#160;

Our PRC subsidiaries are wholly foreign-owned and joint venture enterprises under the PRC law. The principal regulations governing the distribution of dividends paid by wholly foreign-owned enterprises include:

&#160;

&#8226; Corporate Law (1993), as amended in 2005 and 2013; &#160;

&#8226; The Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended in 2000; &#160;

&#8226; The Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law Implementation Regulations (1990), as amended in 2001; and &#160;

&#8226; The Enterprise Income Tax Law (2007) and its Implementation Regulations (2007). &#160;

Under these regulations, wholly foreign-owned and joint venture enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, an enterprise in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until its cumulative total reserve funds reaches 50% of its registered capital. The board of directors of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise has the discretion to allocate a portion of its after-tax profits to its employee welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds, however, may not be distributed as cash dividends.

&#160;

On March 16, 2007, the National People&#8217;s Congress enacted the Enterprise Income Tax Law, and on December 6, 2007, the State Council issued the Implementation Regulations on the Enterprise Income Tax Law, both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under this law and its implementation regulations, dividends payable by a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC to its foreign investor who is a non-resident enterprise will be subject to a 10% withholding tax, unless any such foreign investor&#8217;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with the PRC that provides for a lower withholding tax rate.

M&#38;A Rules and Regulation on Overseas Listings 

&#160;

On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, the Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (&#8220;CSRC&#8221;) and the SAFE, jointly adopted the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&#38;A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006. The M&#38;A Rules purport, among other things, to require that offshore SPVs that are controlled by PRC companies or individuals and that have been formed for overseas listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic interests held by such PRC companies or individuals, obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by SPVs seeking CSRC approval of their overseas listings.

&#160;

While the application of the M&#38;A Rules remains unclear, our PRC counsel have advised us that, based on their understanding of the current PRC laws and regulations as well as the notice announced on September 21, 2006:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; the CSRC currently has not issued any definitive rule or interpretation concerning whether offerings such as our initial public offering are subject to the CSRC approval procedures under the M&#38;A Rules; 

&#160;

&#8226; despite the lack of any definitive rule or interpretation from CSRC, the main purpose of the M&#38;A rule is for national security and national industrial policy and so far none of the Chinese companies that have completed their public listing in the U.S. have obtained such approval; and &#160;

&#8226; our Delaware company is not controlled by a Chinese citizen. Accordingly, although the purpose of Delaware incorporation is for overseas listing, the M&#38;A rule should not apply to us. &#160;

Our PRC counsel also advises us, however, that there is still uncertainty as to how the M&#38;A Rules will be interpreted and implemented. If the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies, subsequently determine that CSRC approval was required for our initial public offering, we may need to apply for remedial approval from the CSRC and we may be subject to penalties and administrative sanctions administered by these regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our initial public offering into the PRC, or take other actions that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock.

&#160;

In addition, if the CSRC later requires that we obtain its approval for our initial public offering, we may be unable to obtain a waiver of the CSRC approval requirements, if and when procedures are established to obtain such a waiver. Any uncertainties or negative publicity regarding the CSRC approval requirements could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.

&#160; 

Restriction on Foreign Ownership 

&#160;

The Foreign Investment Industrial Catalogue jointly issued by the Ministry of Commerce for the People&#8217;s Republic of China and the National Development and Reform Commission in 2011 classified various industries/business into three different categories: (i) encouraged for foreign investment; (ii) restricted to foreign investment; and (iii) prohibited from foreign investment. For any industry/business not covered by any of these three categories, they will be deemed industries/business permitted to have foreign investment. Except for those expressly provided restrictions, encouraged and permitted industries/business are usually 100% open to foreign investment and ownership. With regard to those industries/business restricted to or prohibited from foreign investment, there is always a limitation on foreign investment and ownership. The decoction business conducted by Ankang Longevity Group falls under the industry categories that are prohibited from foreign investment and thus is subject to limitation on foreign investment and ownership. None of the other business activities conducted by us fall under industry categories that are restricted to, or prohibited from foreign investment.

Regulations on Offshore Parent Holding Companies&#8217; Direct Investment in and Loans to Their PRC Subsidiaries 

&#160;

An offshore company may invest equity in a PRC company, which will become the PRC subsidiary of the offshore holding company after investment. Such equity investment is subject to a series of laws and regulations generally applicable to any foreign-invested enterprise in China, which include the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Contractual Joint Venture Enterprise Law, all as amended from time to time, and their respective implementing rules; the Tentative Provisions on the Foreign Exchange Registration Administration of Foreign-Invested Enterprise; and the Notice on Certain Matters Relating to the Change of Registered Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises.

&#160;

Under the aforesaid laws and regulations, the increase of the registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise is subject to the prior approval by the original approval authority of its establishment. In addition, the increase of registered capital and total investment amount shall both be registered with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (&#8220;SAIC&#8221;) and SAFE.

&#160;

Shareholder loans made by offshore parent holding companies to their PRC subsidiaries are regarded as foreign debts in China for regulatory purposes, which debts are subject to a number of PRC laws and regulations, including the PRC Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, the Interim Measures on Administration on Foreign Debts, the Tentative Provisions on the Statistics Monitoring of Foreign Debts and its implementation rules, and the Administration Rules on the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange.

&#160;

Under these regulations, the shareholder loans made by offshore parent holding companies to their PRC subsidiaries shall be registered with SAFE. Furthermore, the total amount of foreign debts that can be incurred by such PRC subsidiaries, including any shareholder loans, shall not exceed the difference between the total investment amount and the registered capital amount of the PRC subsidiaries, both of which are subject to governmental approval.

&#160; 

Regulations on Trademarks 

&#160;

Trademarks are protected by the PRC Trademark Law adopted in 1982, as subsequently amended, as well as the Implementation Regulations of the PRC Trademark Law adopted by the State Council in 2002 and 2013. The Trademark Office under the SAIC handles trademark registrations. Trademarks can be registered for a term of ten years and can be extended for another ten years if requested upon expiration of the first or any renewed ten-year term. The PRC Trademark Law has adopted a &#8220;first-to-file&#8221; principle with respect to trademark registration. Where a trademark for which a registration application has been made is identical or similar to another trademark which has already been registered or been subject to a preliminary examination and approval for use on the same type of or similar commodities or services, the application for such trademark registration may be rejected. Any person applying for the registration of a trademark may not prejudice the existing right first obtained by others, nor may any person register in advance a trademark that has already been used by another party and has already gained a &#8220;sufficient degree of reputation&#8221; through such other party&#8217;s use. Trademark license agreements must be filed with the Trademark Office or its regional offices.

&#160; 

Regulations on Patents 

&#160;

The PRC Patent Law provides for patentable inventions, utility models and designs, which must meet three conditions: novelty, inventiveness and practical applicability. The State Intellectual Property Office is responsible for examining and approving patent applications. A patent is valid for a term of twenty years in the case of an invention and a term of ten years in the case of utility models and designs. Presently the company has obtained a patent in the People&#8217;s Republic of China for Luobuma fiber yarn preparation and an application method (patent number: 201110429362.9), which patent is a critical patent used for our high-pressure steam degumming process project. The company also obtained the patents listed below in the People&#8217;s Republic of China, which patents have been suspended due to unintentional late payment of annual dues. The company is in the process of reinstating such suspended patents.

PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and Individual Income Tax Law 

&#160;

Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law or EIT Law, enterprises are classified as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. PRC resident enterprises typically pay an enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%. An enterprise established outside of the PRC with its &#8220;de facto management bodies&#8221; located within the PRC is considered a &#8220;resident enterprise,&#8221; meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a PRC domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementation rules of the EIT Law define &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; as a managing body that in practice exercises &#8220;substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties&#8221; of the enterprise.

&#160;

The SAT Circular 82 issued by the SAT in April 2009 provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; of a PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise is located in China. Pursuant to the SAT Circular 82, a PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise has its &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; in China only if all of the following conditions are met: (a) the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function have their presence mainly in the PRC; (b) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (c) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#8217; meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (d) more than half of the enterprise&#8217;s directors or senior management with voting rights habitually reside in the PRC. The SAT Bulletin 45, in effect from September 2011, provides more guidance on the implementation of the SAT Circular 82 and provides for procedures and administration details on determining resident status and administration on post-determination matters. Although the SAT Circular 82 and the SAT Bulletin 45 only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreign individuals, the determining criteria set forth there may reflect the SAT&#8217;s general position on how the &#8220;de facto management body&#8221; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups or by PRC or foreign individuals.

Due to the lack of applicable legal precedents, it remains unclear how the PRC tax authorities will determine the PRC tax resident treatment of a foreign company controlled by individuals. We may be classified as a PRC &#8220;resident enterprise&#8221; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders, and would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.

PRC Value Added Tax 

&#160;

Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Value Added Tax, all entities and individuals that are engaged in the businesses of sales of goods, provision of repair and placement services and importation of goods into China are generally subject to a VAT at a rate of 17% (with the exception of certain goods which are subject to a rate of 13%) of the gross sales proceeds received, less any VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayer on the goods or services purchased by it and utilized in the production of goods or provisions of services that have generated the gross sales proceeds.

&#160; 

PRC Business Tax 

&#160;

Companies in China are generally subject to business tax and related surcharges by various local tax authorities at rates ranging from 3% to 20% on revenue generated from providing services and revenue generated from the transfer of intangibles.

&#160;

Beginning May 1, 2016, all business tax was changed to the form of value added tax in China, and there is no longer business tax imposed in China.

Employment Laws 

&#160;

In accordance with the PRC National Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees in order to establish an employment relationship. All employers must compensate their employees equal to at least the local minimum wage standards. All employers are required to establish a system for labor safety and sanitation, strictly abide by state rules and standards and provide employees with appropriate workplace safety training. In addition, employers in China are obliged to pay contributions to the social insurance plan and the housing fund plan for employees.

&#160;

We have not entered into employment agreements with any of our executive officers. We have contributed to the basic and minimum social insurance plan. While we believe we have made adequate provision of such outstanding amounts of contributions to such plans in our audited financial statements, any failure to make sufficient payments to such plans would be in violation of applicable PRC laws and regulations and, if we are found to be in violation of such laws and regulations, we could be required to make up the contributions for such plans as well as to pay late fees and fines.

Regulations on Environmental Protection 

&#160;

According to the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution Law, China adopted a licensing system for pollutant discharge. Companies directly or indirectly responsible for discharge of industrial waste water or medical sewage to waters shall be required to obtain a pollutant discharge license. All companies are prohibited from discharging wastewater and sewage to waters without or in violation of the terms of the pollutant discharge license.

&#160;

The Regulations on the Administration of Construction Projects Environmental Protection governs construction projects and the impact such projects will have on the environment. Pursuant to the Regulations on the Administration of Construction Projects Environmental Protection, the governing body is responsible for supervising the implementation of a three tiered system that includes (i) reviewing and approving a construction project, (ii) overseeing the construction project and (iii) to inspect the finished construction project and ensure that all harmful pollutants are disposed of correctly.
