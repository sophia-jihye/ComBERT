Status of New Products 

The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products. Recent acquisitions especially in the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment expand the Company&#8217;s ability to serve the customers&#8217; evolving needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products. The Company does not expect any of its new products to have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s revenues in 2016. 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 

Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s raw materials are agricultural commodities. In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. The Company&#8217;s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis. The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials. 

Item 1. 

BUSINESS (Continued) 

Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 

The Company owns patents, trademarks, and licenses, including approximately $209 million of trademarks from the Wild Flavors acquisition in 2014, but does not consider any segment of its business dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks or licenses. 

Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers 

Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services. There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company&#8217;s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, sugarcane, and other grains. 

&#160; 

The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company&#8217;s working capital requirements. Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months. Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels. No material part of the Company&#8217;s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world. Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest. 

Competition 

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company. Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company&#8217;s asset portfolio. 

Research and Development Expenditures 

The Company&#8217;s research and development expenditures are focused on responding to demand from customers&#8217; product development or formulation needs, improving processing efficiency, and developing food, feed, fuel, and industrial products from renewable agricultural crops. Research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , net of reimbursements of government grants, was approximately $122 million , $79 million , and $59 million , respectively. The increase in 2014 and 2015 is due principally to research and development activities of the recently acquired Wild Flavors. 

Recent acquisitions have significantly increased the Company&#8217;s laboratories and technical centers around the world that greatly enhance the Company&#8217;s ability to interact with customers in Europe, Asia, and South America, not only to provide flavors, but also to support the sales of other food ingredients. In addition, the acquisition of Wild Flavors approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development. A number of these laboratories are being expanded with new capabilities to enhance the Company&#8217;s ability to develop custom solutions for our customers. 

The Company is working with the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s National Energy Technology Laboratory and other key academic and corporate partners on projects to demonstrate carbon capture and sequestration as a viable option for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing operations. The first project, Illinois Basin Decatur Project, started operations in the first quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and successfully completed injecting 1 million tons of CO 2 &#32;in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. The second project, the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture &#38; Sequestration, commenced construction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. This second facility obtained the underground injection control permit in November 2014 and is expected to receive authorization to start injection in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.

BUSINESS (Continued) 

The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of industrial chemicals with an objective to produce key chemical building blocks that serve as a platform for producing a variety of commodity chemicals. The key chemical building blocks are derived from the Company&#8217;s starch and oilseed-based feedstocks. Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis. The chemicals pipeline includes the development of chemicals and intermediates that are currently produced from petrochemical resources as well as new-to-the-market bio-based products. The Company&#8217;s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration. In an effort to further advance the development of bio-based chemical technologies, the Company has partnered with the Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis and has added research capabilities at the University of Kansas. 

Environmental Compliance 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , $61 million was spent specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies. 

There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. 

The Company&#8217;s business could be affected in the future by national and global regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted regulations requiring the owners and operators of certain facilities to measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. EPA has also begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary and mobile sources under the Clean Air Act. For example, the U.S. EPA has promulgated rules regarding the construction and operation of boilers, which could indirectly affect the Company by limiting the construction of new coal-fired boilers and significantly increasing the complexity and cost of modifying any existing coal-fired boilers. California is also moving forward with various programs to reduce greenhouse gases. Globally, a number of countries that are parties to the Kyoto Protocol have instituted or are considering climate change legislation, regulations, and agreements. Most notable is the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading System. The Company has several facilities in Europe that participate in this system. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment. 

Number of Employees 

The number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately 32,300 at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 33,900 at December 31, 2014 . The net decrease in the number of full-time employees is primarily related to the sale of the Company&#8217;s cocoa and chocolate businesses partially offset by acquisitions.
