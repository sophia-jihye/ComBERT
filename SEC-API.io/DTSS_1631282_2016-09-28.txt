&#160;

Micro Marketing Service &#160;&#8211; Another component of the Xin Platform is our office to office, or O2O, management platform. The Company developed a micro marketing service (&#8220;MMS&#8221;) via the O2O management system, which provides marketing services to traditional merchants such as supermarkets, hotels, shopping malls and restaurants.

&#160;

Product Manufacturing 

&#160; 

For cost savings purposes, the Company has outsourced the production of Internet security equipment to Shenzhen Shunxin Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Shenzhen Shunxin&#8221;), a third-party entity in Guangdong Province, China. Shenzhen Shunxin has a permit issued by the Ministry of Public Security for manufacturing Internet security products. Pursuant to the Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreement with the Company, Shenzhen Shunxin has the obligation to meet the technical standard set forth by the Company. The products to be manufactured by Shenzhen Shunxin are currently in the testing phase. We expect the testing period to be completed around January 2017. In the meantime, we purchase equipment from other companies to satisfying our needs. If the demands for our products increase in the future, we would need to negotiate agreements with new manufacturing contractors or build our own manufacturing facilities to meet increasing customer demands for our equipment.

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company promotes its products and services through both traditional and new media marketing channels. The Company is in the process of establishing a nationwide distribution network consisting of agents in different regions. Currently, the Company has a total of 26 regional agents located in four provinces including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Shandong, and Sichuan. The Ministry of Public Security determines whether the Company&#8217;s wired and wireless gateways with network security auditing functionality will be named as recommended products. Pertinent to the requirements of the Ministry of Public Security, Shuhai Beijing chooses distributors with either relationships with the Public Security Bureau or market promotion capability and experience to effectively and quickly install wired or wireless gateways with network security auditing functionality into retailors&#8217; shop and capture market share. The Company organizes seminars to provide regional agents trainings on the technical features and pricing structures of its Internet security equipment.

The Company also plans to market its products and services by providing potential customers the opportunities to try out its products and services.

&#160;

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

The Company currently markets its products and services solely in the PRC. The primary target customers for its Internet security equipment and ISP connecting service will be Internet users. In particular, our primary target customers of indoor Internet security equipment are facilities that provide free Internet access to their customers such as hotels, hospitals and schools. These facilities are required by the Ministry of Public Security and its local counterparts to install Internet security equipment on their computers. Our primary target consumers of outdoor Internet security equipment are local branches of the Ministry of Public Security as part of their efforts to set up Internet security systems mandated by the Ministry of Public Security. We recently secured a government procurement contract of 4,000 outdoor Internet security equipment from the Bureau of Public Security of Daqing City in Heilongjiang Province. As of the date of this report, we have completed installation of all the equipment and are waiting for final customer acceptance.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Internet security equipment industry in the PRC is highly competitive. With the rapid development of the Internet over the past two decades, new cybersecurity technology has been continuously developing and new cybersecurity products have been continuously entering the market. The Company has several competitors in both the Internet security equipment and new media advertising markets. Our three largest competitors in China are Guangzhou Xunqi Digital Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen RenZixing Network Technology Co., Ltd. and Zhuhai Jilangling Network Technology Co., Ltd. Our competitors in the ISP connecting service market are primarily China Telecom and China Unicom, both are state own enterprises with over 70% market share collectively.

&#160;

In order to compete with mature competitors with longer operating history, we decide to offer our ISP connecting service and micro marketing along with Internet security equipment as a package to facilities that offer free Internet access to their customers such as hotels and hospitals. We believe that such integration strategy will offer these facilities one-stop shopping at a relatively low price and accordingly enhance our competitive position.
