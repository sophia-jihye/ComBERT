Our primary business is investing in real estate and mortgage receivables. Land held subject to sales contract is our sole operating segment. At December 31, 2015, our land consisted of 131.1acres of land held subject to sales contract All of our land holdings are located in Texas. The principal source of revenue for the Company is interest income on over $24.8 million of notes receivable due from related parties.

&#160;

Significant Real Estate Acquisitions/Dispositions and Financings 

&#160;

A summary of the significant transactions for the year ended December 31, 2015 are discussed below:

&#160;

During September 2015, the Company, in exchange for a $3.0 million payment, granted additional easement rights to the City of Farmers Branch, Texas. The Company retained title to the property and recorded the payment as a reduction in real estate land holdings.

In November 2015, the Company entered into a sales contract with an unrelated party. The contract was for all of the developable land owned by the Company. In addition, TCI, ARL and RAI also sold land in this transaction. Total consideration for the sale was $75 million. The ultimate allocation of sales proceeds to the parties involved is yet to be determined and will be completed when the final use of the land, certain development commitments are completed and the note is collected. The agreement between the parties to this transaction provides for TCI to hold the subordinated note from the buyer in the amount of $50 million. At the closing, the note payable to related parties of $9.6 million was paid off. Due to an inadequate down payment from the buyer and the level of seller financing involved, the transaction is being accounted for under the deposit method. Under the deposit method, no revenue is recognized and the asset sold remains on the books until the criteria for full revenue recognition are met. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Business Plan 

&#160;

Our business is investing in equity interests in real estate through direct equity investments and partnerships, and financing real estate and real estate-related activities through investments in mortgage loans. All of our real estate is located in the southwest region of the continental United States. The land portfolio which is land held subject to a sales contract, is currently our only operating segment.

&#160;

Our business is not seasonal. Management has determined to pursue a balanced investment strategy, seeking both current income and capital appreciation. With respect to new investments, management&#8217;s plan of operation is to acquire above average apartment and commercial properties, in keeping with the current class of properties in our real estate portfolio. Management intends to focus on income-producing property acquisitions to maintain a balance between income-producing and non-income-producing properties. Management does not expect that we will seek to fund or acquire additional mortgage loans. We may, however, originate mortgage loans in conjunction with providing purchase money financing of a property acquisition.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The real estate business is highly competitive and IOT competes with numerous entities engaged in real estate activities (including certain entities described in Part III, Item 13. &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#8221;), some of which have greater financial resources than IOT. We believe that success against such competition is dependent upon the geographic location, the allowable use of the property and the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors include ease of access to the property, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking and other amenities, and sensitivity to market conditions in determining value. We believe that beyond general economic circumstances and trends, the degree to which properties are renovated or new properties are developed in the competing submarket are also competitive factors. See also Part I, Item1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;.

&#160;

To the extent that the Company seeks to sell any of its properties, the sales prices for such properties may be affected by competition from other real estate owners and financial institutions also attempting to sell properties in areas where IOT&#8217;s properties are located, as well as aggressive buyers attempting to penetrate or dominate a particular market.

&#160;

As described above and in Part III, Item 13. &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#8221; the officers and directors of IOT also serve as officers or directors of ARL and TCI. Both ARL and TCI have business objectives similar to those of IOT. IOT&#8217;s officers and directors owe fiduciary duties to both ARL and TCI as well as to IOT under applicable law. In determining whether a particular investment opportunity will be allocated to IOT, ARL, or TCI, management considers the respective investment objectives of each Company and the appropriateness of a particular investment in light of each Company&#8217;s existing real estate and mortgage notes receivable portfolio. To the extent that any particular investment opportunity is appropriate to more than one of the entities, the investment opportunity may be allocated to the entity which has had funds available for investment for the longest period of time, or, if appropriate, the investment may be shared among all three or two of the entities.

&#160;

In addition, as described in Part III, Item 13. &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#8221;, IOT competes with related parties of Pillar having similar investment objectives related to the acquisition, development, disposition, leasing and financing of real estate and real estate related investments. In resolving any potential conflicts of interest which may arise, Pillar has informed IOT that it intends to exercise its best judgment as to what is fair and reasonable under the circumstances in accordance with applicable law.

&#160;

We have historically engaged in and will continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties, including but not limited to asset acquisitions and dispositions. Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm&#8217;s length basis due to the absence of free market forces that naturally exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities. Related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business and may include terms, conditions and agreements that are not necessarily beneficial to or in the best interests of our company.
