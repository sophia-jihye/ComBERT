 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative, minimally-systemic therapeutic drugs that work exclusively in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract to treat GI and cardio-renal diseases. We have developed a proprietary drug discovery and design platform enabling us, in a rapid and cost-efficient manner, to discover and design novel drug candidates. Utilizing our platform, we discovered and designed our lead product candidate, tenapanor, which is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS-C. In a Phase 2b clinical study, tenapanor demonstrated the ability to improve the symptoms of IBS-C. In a separate Phase 2b clinical trial, tenapanor demonstrated the ability to lower elevated serum phosphorus levels in patients with end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. We have initiated an additional Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate dosing regimens of tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia, or elevated serum phosphorus, in ESRD patients, and we expect to receive results from this trial in the second half of 2016. We are developing another drug candidate, RDX022, for the treatment of hyperkalemia, or elevated serum potassium. In January 2016, we announced the results of an open label clinical study evaluating the pharmacodynamic activity of RDX022 in healthy adult volunteers. The study demonstrated that RDX022 was generally well-tolerated at all doses evaluated and effectively binds to potassium in the GI tract, supporting our plans to proceed with a Phase 3 clinical program, which we currently expect to initiate in the second half of 2016. We are pursuing a 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for RDX022. We have additional drug candidates in earlier stages of research and development focused in GI and cardio-renal diseases including RDX009, a secretagogue of glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, and glucagon-like peptide-2, or GLP-2, and RDX013, a potassium secretagogue. We currently expect to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, for RDX009 in the second half of 2016. 

Tenapanor is a minimally-systemic small molecule that acts locally in the GI tract to inhibit the sodium transporter NHE3 and reduce sodium and phosphorus uptake from the gut. In human studies of orally- administered tenapanor, the drug was detected in the blood in only 0.7% of more than 3,000 collected serum samples, and even in those, at very low levels (&#60; 1.5 ng/mL). We have evaluated tenapanor in fourteen human clinical studies in over 1,000 individuals to date. We are currently evaluating tenapanor in two different programs: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; IBS-C : In the fourth quarter 2015, we initiated two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating tenapanor in patients with IBS-C, and we currently expect results from those trials in 2017. In a Phase 2b clinical study, tenapanor demonstrated the ability to improve symptoms of IBS-C. In that study, the twice daily 50 mg dose of tenapanor met the primary efficacy endpoint of an increase in the complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) responder rate. Most secondary endpoints, including abdominal pain, the overall responder rate and other abdominal and IBS-C symptoms, demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients : In the fourth quarter 2015, we initiated a second Phase 2b clinical study to evaluate the optimal dosing regimen for tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients, and we expect results from this trial in the second half of 2016. We have designed the clinical trial and the statistical analysis plan so that, assuming positive results, there is the potential that the FDA may agree that this trial could be considered the first of two well-controlled studies to support an NDA for our hyperphosphatemia indication. Results from the first Phase 2b clinical study in this indication were announced in 2015. In that study, there was a statistically significant dose-related decrease in serum phosphate levels for tenapanor-treated patients compared to patients receiving placebo (p=0.012). It was noted, however, that the rate of diarrhea and the rate of discontinuations due to diarrhea were higher than expected based on previous clinical trials. Higher discontinuations rates due to diarrhea were observed primarily in the 30 mg once daily and 30 mg twice daily dose groups. The overall safety profile remained consistent with that observed in previous tenapanor trials. &#160;

We believe the market opportunity for tenapanor for these two potential patient populations may be significant. Based on reports in the literature regarding the prevalence of IBS in the U.S. population and the percentage of individuals who have IBS-C as compared to other forms of IBS, we believe that 1.4% of the U.S. population, or approximately 4.4 million individuals in the United States have IBS-C, and that approximately 1.0 million of those patients have been diagnosed with IBS-C. Additionally, we estimate that there are about 6.6 million IBS-C patients in Europe and about 3.4 million in Japan. 

We are developing RDX022 for the treatment of hyperkalemia. RDX022 is our proprietary oral, non-absorbed potassium-binder. It is based on polystyrene sulfonate, a well-known and well-characterized polymer, used to treat hyperkalemia. We have made numerous improvements to the polymer by engineering into RDX022 several key physical and chemical modifications in an effort to improve various properties. We also changed the counter-ion from sodium to calcium to be more consistent with standard of care in these patients. We have filed a patent application covering the composition of matter for these modifications. Data from the literature as well as independent market research suggests that hyperkalemia affects about 900,000 individuals with CKD Stage 3b or Stage 4, about 900,000 patients with HF and about 200,000 patients with ESRD. In January 2016, we announced results from an open-label pharmacodynamic study of RDX022 in healthy adult volunteers. In this study, RDX022 was administered at 4.6 g BID (9.2 g/day), 6.9 g BID (13.8 g/day), 4.6 g TID (13.8 g/day) and 9.2 g TID (27.5 g/day), and resulted in a mean increase of fecal potassium from baseline of 888 mg/day, 1,791 mg/day, 1,408 mg/day, and 1,670 mg/day, respectively. RDX022 was generally well-tolerated at all doses and demonstrated comparable results to those observed with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Other fecal electrolytes were monitored during the study and no unexpected changes were observed; in particular, fecal magnesium remained unchanged from baseline. We currently expect to begin a Phase 3 clinical study with RDX022 in the second half of 2016. 

Utilizing our proprietary drug discovery and design platform, we are pursuing other internal discovery and lead-development programs that are currently in the research phase. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; RDX009 Program : Our focus is the discovery and development of minimally-systemic TGR5 agonists that stimulate GLP-1 and GLP-2 secretion. We are evaluating RDX009 in animal models for its effect in multiple indications. In December 2015, we declared a development candidate for RDX009 and currently expect to file an IND for RDX009 in the second half of 2016. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; RDX013 Program : We are continuing to research RDX013, a small molecule drug candidate for hyperkalemia. This agent, a potential potassium secretagogue, is intended to enhance potassium secretion or prevent potassium absorption with a much lower pill burden than potassium binders and may provide significant advantages as a stand-alone agent or used in combination with potassium binders, including RDX022. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; RDX011 Program : We intend to leverage our knowledge of NHE3 inhibitors and their effect on phosphate management as we seek to further understand tenapanor&#146;s phosphate lowering mechanism of action. We also intend to evaluate new indications for tenapanor and other NHE3 inhibitors in order to exploit the unique capabilities and tools we have developed to modulate ion transport channels located on mucosal surfaces. OUR PROPRIETARY DRUG DISCOVERY AND DESIGN PLATFORM 

Our platform, comprised of proprietary know-how and drug discovery and design tools, provides us with a competitive advantage in drug development. This platform enables us, in a rapid and cost-efficient manner, to discover and design novel drug candidates that work exclusively in the GI tract to treat GI and cardio-renal diseases. By targeting receptors and transporters localized in the GI tract, we can modulate certain important functions of the gut, such as absorption of specific nutrients and minerals, or the gut&#146;s various hormonal functions, to treat and prevent diseases while avoiding systemic toxicities. 

&#160;

The pillars of our drug discovery and design platform include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Medicinal Chemistry to develop minimally-systemic products : our medicinal chemistry team has developed the tools, expertise and approach to ensure that our small molecule drug candidates are potent, have appropriate drug properties, are able to be readily manufactured, and are minimally- systemic, a property that we believe is not generally targeted for most other drug programs; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In vivo pharmacology : Our in vivo pharmacology group has developed animal models and expertise in-house that allow it to rapidly assess the minimally-systemic nature of our drug candidates as well as test the hypotheses that our drug candidates can treat and prevent diseases and conditions in our targeted therapeutic fields; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; GI Informatics : With genetic and proteomic informatics tools, we have identified over 3,800 human GI tract-specific RNA transcripts and proteins on the inner surface of the gut, many of which we believe may be drug targets. We intend to become leading experts in human and rodent gut physiology and the molecular pathways that lead to disease in our targeted therapeutic areas; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; In vitro expertise : We have developed a cell-culture system that simulates gut tissue. We call this component of our discovery platform Ardelyx Primary Enterocyte and Colonocyte Culture System, or APECCS. APECCS involves the biopsy of various segments of the gut and the growth of those cells under proprietary conditions to maintain, to the extent possible, the integrity and functionality of the various cell types and substructures. We have developed this into a miniaturized format that allows us to utilize it for cell based drug screening. In addition to using APECCS in the design of our small molecule drug candidates, we use the APECCS technology to measure epithelial transport of ions and nutrients and to screen compounds to identify potential disease modulators such as inhibitors or activators using phenotypic screening. APECCS has the potential to allow us to identify novel targets, mechanisms of action and physiology as well as provide us an early understanding of how identified compounds may interact with specific gut tissues. In addition, we believe that APECCS may also provide us with a clear path to translate cell-based observations into in vivo rodent models and ultimately into human clinical studies. OUR STRATEGY 

We are a biotechnology company with a clinical pipeline of drug candidates in the fields of GI and cardio-renal diseases. We are currently advancing the clinical development of our two product candidates, tenapanor and RDX022, and we currently expect to file an IND for RDX009 in the second half of 2016. 

Our goal is to use our proprietary drug discovery and design platform to discover new minimally-systemic drug candidates that prevent and treat important diseases in these same therapeutic areas of GI and cardio-renal diseases. To date, all of our drug candidates have resulted from our internal research. 

If our drug candidates are approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we expect to participate in the commercialization of our products with our own specialty-based sales force, initially targeting gastroenterologists and nephrologists. 

Our executive management team, and in particular our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Raab, has extensive experience in developing and commercializing therapeutic drugs for the CKD and ESRD markets, and we expect to leverage this expertise in a manner that will allow us to create and retain significant value from our marketed products. 

&#160;

OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE 

The following table summarizes key information about our product candidates as of December 31, 2015: 

&#160;

Tenapanor 

Tenapanor is a minimally-systemic small molecule that acts locally in the GI tract to inhibit the sodium transporter NHE3 and reduce sodium and phosphorus uptake from the gut. In human studies of orally- administered tenapanor, the drug was detected in the blood in only 0.7% of more than 3,000 collected serum samples, and even in those, at very low levels (&#60; 1.5 ng/mL) confirming that tenapanor is minimally-systemic. We have evaluated tenapanor in fourteen human clinical studies in over 1,000 individuals to date. We are currently evaluating tenapanor for the treatment of constipation and pain in IBS-C patients and for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients. 

Tenapanor for treating IBS-C 

IBS-C is a GI disorder in which abdominal pain or discomfort is associated with constipation, which significantly affects the health and quality of life of affected patients. In a recent study led by Dr. Joel J. Heidelbaugh (published in 2015), over 50% of IBS-C patients rated their pain, constipation and straining as being &#147;extremely bothersome.&#148; In the same study, GI symptoms led to an average 4.9 days of &#147;disrupted productivity&#148; and 0.8 days of missed work per month. Additionally, IBS-C led to over 50% of patients seeking physician care in the past 12 months and over a third were &#147;a little or not at all satisfied&#148; with their physician care. It is currently unknown what causes IBS-C. There is no specific test or biomarker for IBS-C and therefore, its presence is diagnosed by symptoms and by eliminating other disorders. IBS-C is very similar to chronic constipation and it is clinically distinguished by a significant pain component. 

Clinical data supporting tenapanor in IBS-C 

We conducted a Phase 2b clinical trial in IBS-C patients and announced results from that study in October 2014. The clinical trial was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three dose levels of tenapanor in 371 subjects with IBS-C as defined by the Rome III criteria and who had active disease as determined during a two-week screening period. Subjects who qualified 

&#160;

and who were randomized into the study received 5, 20, or 50 mg of tenapanor or placebo twice daily for 12 consecutive weeks. At the end of this treatment period, subjects were followed for an additional 4 weeks. The results were reported on an intent-to-treat basis. 

The primary endpoint, CSBM responder rate, was achieved in 60.7% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 33.7% receiving placebo (p&#60;0.001). A CSBM responder was defined as a patient who had an increase of greater than or equal to one CSBM from baseline during 6 out of 12 weeks. We also measured a more stringent CSBM response where a responder was defined as a patient who an increase of greater than or equal to one CSBM from baseline and had three or more CSBMs per week during 9 out of 12 weeks. The CSBM 9 of 12 week responder rate was achieved in 23.8% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 7.9% receiving placebo (p&#60;0.004). 

An abdominal pain responder was achieved in 65.5% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 48.3% receiving placebo (p&#60;0.026). An abdominal pain responder was defined as a patient who experienced at least a 30% decrease in abdominal pain from baseline for 6 of 12 weeks. We also measured a more stringent abdominal pain responder rate where a responder was defined as a patient who experienced at least a 30% decrease in abdominal pain from baseline for 9 of 12 weeks. For this more stringent abdominal pain measurement, the abdominal pain 9 of 12 responder rate was achieved in 48.8% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 31.5% receiving placebo (p&#60;0.022). 

The overall responder rate, or dual composite endpoint percent, was achieved in 50% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 23.6% receiving placebo (p&#60;0.001). An overall responder was defined as a patient who was a CSBM responder and an abdominal pain responder during the same week for 6 of 12 weeks. We also measured a more stringent overall responder rate where a responder was defined as a patient who was both a CSBM responder and an abdominal pain responder during the same week for 9 of 12 weeks. The overall 9 of 12 week responder rate was achieved in 20.2% of patients receiving tenapanor 50 mg twice daily versus 6.7% receiving placebo (p&#60;0.01). 

Most other secondary endpoints measured also demonstrated significant improvements for patients receiving 50 mg tenapanor twice daily compared to placebo-treated patients. 

A dose response relationship among all doses was observed in the primary endpoint, as well as in most secondary endpoints, although statistical significance was not achieved at the 5 mg or 20 mg doses. Additionally, the activity of tenapanor was maintained throughout the entire 12-week treatment period. 

Tenapanor was well-tolerated in these patients, and the safety results were consistent with those observed in previous tenapanor trials. The most common adverse events at 50 mg twice daily (greater than or equal to 5%) that occurred more frequently in tenapanor-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients were diarrhea at 11.2% vs. 0%, and urinary tract infections at 5.6% vs. 4.4%. Overall rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4.5% for the tenapanor-treated patients (50 mg twice daily) and 3.3% for the placebo-treated patients. Based on the analysis of plasma samples tested as part of the study, the minimally-systemic nature of tenapanor was confirmed. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we initiated two pivotal Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating tenapanor in IBS-C patients. We expect to enroll approximately 600 patients in each trial, and we currently expect results from these two Phase 3 clinical trials in 2017. The primary endpoint in each of the trials is the 6 of 12 week overall responder rate. An overall responder is defined as a weekly responder for 6 of 12 weeks where both an abdominal pain response and a CSBM response criteria are met during the same week. An abdominal pain responder is defined as a patient with a 30% or greater reduction in average weekly worst abdominal pain compared to baseline during the week, and a CSBM responder is defined as a patient who has an increase of one or more in average weekly CSBMs compared to baseline during the week. We are also evaluating other endpoints in these studies, including CSBM and abdominal pain responder rates for 6 of 12 weeks as well as for 9 of 12 weeks, abdominal symptoms and other clinically relevant endpoints. 

&#160;

The IBS-C market opportunity 

Numerous treatments exist for the constipation component of IBS-C, many of which are over-the-counter. We are aware of two prescription products marketed for IBS-C, Linzess (linaclotide) marketed by Ironwood Pharmaceuticals and Allergan and Amitiza (lubiprostone) marketed by Sucampo and Takeda. In Phase 3 clinical trials of Linzess in IBS-C patients, up to 20% more patients receiving Linzess than placebo reached the primary endpoint, overall responder rate, indicating a significant response during 6 out of 12 weeks of treatment. In these studies, Linzess caused diarrhea in up to 17% more patients than placebo. 

We believe that tenapanor may offer a significant benefit over currently marketed drugs like Amitiza and Linzess, due in part to the potential to adjust the dose and/or dose frequency of tenapanor in order to optimize its efficacy and minimize diarrhea. The data we have generated in both animal and human studies have suggested that the effect of tenapanor for the treatment of IBS-C can be modulated by adjusting its dose and dose frequency. 

Based on reports in the literature regarding the prevalence of IBS in the U.S. population and the percentage of individuals who have IBS-C as opposed to other forms of IBS, we estimate that approximately 1.4% of the U.S. population has IBS-C, or about 4.4 million individuals, and that approximately 1.0 million of those patients have been diagnosed with IBS-C. Additionally, we estimate there are about 6.6 million IBS-C patients in Europe and about 3.4 million in Japan. 

Tenapanor for treating hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients 

CKD is the progressive deterioration of renal function that can occur over several months or years. The symptoms of worsening kidney function are nonspecific, and can include having less energy, reduced appetite, dry itchy skin, swollen feet and ankles, or generally just not feeling well. If the deterioration continues and is not halted by either changes in lifestyle or with the assistance of pharmacological intervention, the disease will likely cause significant cardiovascular morbidity, and can progress to ESRD, the final stage of CKD, where kidney function will be lost entirely. 

Current management of ESRD includes hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis as a means to filter toxins from the blood once kidneys have failed. Unless this intervention occurs, kidney failure results in the accumulation of waste products that may ultimately cause death. Hemodialysis, the most common form of dialysis, generally requires a patient to visit a dialysis center at least three times per week for a three- to five-hour session, significantly reducing quality of life. 

Phosphorus, a vital element required for most cellular processes, is present in almost every food in the Western diet, and, in individuals with normal kidney function, any excess dietary phosphorus is efficiently removed by the kidney and excreted in urine. In adults with functioning kidneys, normal serum phosphorus levels are 2.6 to 3.8 mg/dL. With kidney failure, elevated phosphorus becomes harmful and is diagnosed as hyperphosphatemia when serum phosphorus levels are greater than 5.0 mg/dL. Although patients with ESRD rely on dialysis to eliminate harmful agents, phosphorus is not readily removed by the procedure and other means of managing phosphorus levels must be employed. 

In ESRD, excess levels of phosphorus have been shown to lead to an increase in cardiovascular disease risk, as well as increases in serum FGF-23, an important serum endocrine hormone that regulates phosphorus metabolism, and elevated parathyroid hormone, also known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. These endocrine changes in ESRD patients are a concern as elevated parathyroid hormone leads to the development of renal osteodystrophy, a condition of abnormal bone growth characterized by brittle bones. 

Since dialysis is unable to efficiently eliminate excess phosphorus, ESRD patients are put on restrictive low phosphorus diets and are prescribed medications called phosphate binders, the only pharmacologic interventions currently marketed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Binders are a collection of drugs whose function is 

&#160;

to bind, or absorb, dietary phosphorus and are taken in conjunction with meals and snacks. They include calcium, iron or lanthanum, a rare-earth metal, which bind to and precipitate with dietary phosphate in the GI tract. The goal of these elemental phosphorus binders is for patients to eliminate the precipitated phosphorus in their stool. A limitation of this approach is the systemic excess absorption of calcium, iron or lanthanum, resulting in side effects and other unintended consequences for ESRD patients. 

Safety and tolerability have been significant concerns with many approved phosphate binders. The more common side effects of approved phosphate binders include long-term vascular calcification, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea or constipation and ileus or disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the GI tract. 

ESRD patients take on average 10-14 oral medications each day, and they are severely restricted in their fluid intake. In addition, to control their serum phosphorus, their phosphate binder-related pill burden is significant, typically consisting of nine or more pills a day. The amount of phosphate a binder can remove is limited by its binding capacity, and therefore, increasing the dose, and therefore the pill burden, of the binder is the only way to increase the amount of phosphate being bound and excreted. As a result, prescribed binder doses are intolerable for many patients. 

Clinical data supporting tenapanor in hyperphosphatemia 

In February 2015, we announced results from a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating tenapanor for the control of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients. This Phase 2b trial was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, international study evaluating the safety and efficacy of six dose levels of tenapanor (3 and 30 mg once daily, and 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg twice daily) in 161 ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline of serum phosphate levels to the end of treatment and the endpoint was analyzed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA). The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant dose-related decrease in serum phosphate levels for tenapanor-treated patients compared to patients receiving placebo (p=0.012).

* LSMean = least square mean As shown in the table, a dose-response relationship was observed in the primary endpoint and twice daily dosing had better pharmacodynamic activity than once daily dosing. 

As expected, due to its pharmacological actions, the most frequent adverse event was diarrhea. The rate of diarrhea and the discontinuation rate due to diarrhea at the highest doses were higher than expected based on previous clinical trials. Higher discontinuations rates due to diarrhea were observed primarily in the 30 mg once daily and 30 mg twice daily dose groups. There were no other notable gastrointestinal adverse events that appeared to be tenapanor related. The overall safety profile remains consistent with that observed in previous tenapanor trials in this patient population.

We have designed this Phase 2b clinical trial and the statistical analysis plan so that, assuming positive results, there is potential that the FDA may agree that this trial could be considered the first of two well-controlled studies to support an NDA for tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD patients. 

Size of the hyperphosphatemia market 

Phosphate binders are the only pharmacologic interventions currently marketed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Calcium-based binders are the least expensive option to treat hyperphosphatemia. In hemodialysis patients, sevelamer has a 35% patient share versus 45% for calcium-based binders, 15% for lanthanum and 12% for iron-based binders. The various types of phosphate binders commercialized in the United States include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Calcium carbonate (many over-the-counter brands including Tums and Caltrate) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Calcium acetate (several prescription brands including PhosLo and Phoslyra) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol marketed by Shire) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel, marketed by Sanofi) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sevelamer carbonate (Renvela, marketed by Sanofi) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Sucroferric oxyhydroxide (Velphoro, marketed by Vifor Fresenius) &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ferric citrate (Auryxia, marketed by Keryx) Generic sevelamer was expected to enter the U.S. market in early 2014 after expiration of Sanofi&#146;s patent, but as of early 2016, no generic sevelamer has yet been approved. Generic sevelamer was approved, however, in certain jurisdictions in Europe in 2015. 

Each of these agents has certain limitations. Calcium carbonate and calcium acetate can cause long term vascular calcification. 

&#160;

Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) entered the market in 2004 as an alternative to calcium and aluminum based agents, but nephrologists&#146; concerns about the long term toxicity from the absorption of metals such as lanthanum and its GI side effect profile have limited its market penetration. Sevelamer hydrochloride (Renagel) is an acidic formulation of sevelamer that has been linked with worsening of metabolic acidosis in patients. Sevelamer carbonate (Renvela) was developed as an improved formulation of sevelamer to reduce incidence of acidosis. The active ingredient of both products, sevelamer, is associated long-term with vomiting (22%), nausea (20%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (16%), abdominal pain (9%), and flatulence (8%). 

Ferric citrate (Auryxia), an iron-based phosphate binder, was approved by FDA in September 2014. While iron is often deficient in ESRD patients because of CKD-associated anemia and lack of sufficient dietary iron, the FDA has required Auryxia to add a warning of iron-overload in the label. 

The hydrochloride form of sevelamer, Renagel, was launched in the United States by Genzyme Corporation in 1998 prior to its acquisition by Sanofi, and the carbonate form, Renvela, was launched in 2008. Renvela is currently priced in the United States at a cost of more than $7,000 per patient per year, Fosrenol (lanthanum carbonate) is priced at about $7,500 and calcium-based binders are approximately $900. Sevelamer is the leading phosphate binder product in the hemodialysis market with 35% patient share (versus 45% split among several calcium-based binders). Sanofi booked &#128;935 million ($1.04 billion) in worldwide sales of sevelamer during 2015. The U.S. patents for sevelamer expired in February 2014 and generic launch was allowed in March 2014. 

In addition to the currently marketed phosphate binders, we are aware of at least two other binders in development, including fermagate (Alpharen), an iron-based binder in Phase 2 being developed by Opko Health, Inc., and PT20, an iron-based binder in Phase 2 being developed by Phosphate Therapeutics. 

According to the most recent data available from the U.S. Renal Data System, in 2013 there were 421,349 patients on hemodialysis in the United States. Additionally, according to the European ERA-EDTA Registry 2012 Annual Report and a study in 2010 by the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, there were approximately 280,000 patients on hemodialysis in Europe and about 250,000 in Japan. We estimate, based on phosphate binder utilization, the only approved therapies for hyperphosphatemia, that there are approximately 290,000, 225,000 and 220,000 ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia in the United States, Europe and Japan, respectively. 

Because many ESRD patients with hyperphosphatemia are unable to lower serum phosphorus levels to below 5.5 mg/dL with currently marketed phosphate binders, we believe there is a significant opportunity for new agents with new mechanisms, demonstrated efficacy, a strong safety profile, and significantly lower pill burden. 

We believe that tenapanor, if approved, has the potential to have the lowest pill burden among any currently marketed hyperphosphatemia drugs, with milligram rather than gram quantities dosed once or twice daily. In addition, we may evaluate whether tenapanor has the potential to be used in combination with phosphate binders for those patients who cannot achieve adequate phosphate control with a single agent. 

RDX022 for treating hyperkalemia 

We are developing RDX022 for the treatment of hyperkalemia. RDX022 is our proprietary oral, non-absorbed potassium-binder. It based on polystyrene sulfonate, a well-known and well-characterized polymer. We have made numerous improvements to the polymer by engineering into RDX022 several key physical and chemical modifications in an effort to improve various properties. We have filed a patent application covering the composition of matter for these modifications. 

Clinical data supporting RDX022 in hyperkalemia 

In January 2016, we announced results from an open-label pharmacodynamic study of RDX022 in healthy adult volunteers. The study consisted of a two-day treatment-free baseline period and a four-day treatment 

&#160;

period. The study included four cohorts, and in each cohort 12 subjects received RDX022 and three subjects received a similar dose of sodium polystyrene sulfonate, or SPS for a total of 60 subjects. RDX022 was administered at 4.6 g BID (9.2 g/day), 6.9 g BID (13.8 g/day), 4.6 g TID (13.8 g/day) and 9.2 g TID (27.5 g/day), and resulted in a mean increase of fecal potassium from baseline of 888 mg/day, 1,791 mg/day, 1,408 mg/day, and 1,670 mg/day, respectively. RDX022 was generally well-tolerated at all doses and demonstrated comparable results to those observed with SPS. Other fecal electrolytes were monitored during the study and no unexpected changes were observed; in particular, fecal magnesium remained unchanged from baseline. 

Sodium is currently used as a counter-ion in SPS products marketed in the United States and certain other products under development. We formulated RDX022 with a calcium counter-ion, rather than a sodium counter- ion, as adding sodium to the daily intake of the target patient population runs counter to best clinical practice. In patients with CKD and/or HF, the standard of care is a low-sodium diet as sodium can contribute to fluid overload and edema, a common experience for these patients. In addition, excess sodium diminishes the beneficial effects of blood pressure drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or RAAS. We have also improved both the physical properties of polystyrene sulfonate and the formulation in a manner that we expect may lead to improved patient adherence and compliance. Notably, in a single center, randomized, crossover study to evaluate various oral formulations of RDX022 in healthy subjects, RDX022 consistently outperformed SPS in all aspects of the taste assessments, including mouth feel, texture and flavor. 

We currently expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial for RDX022 in the second half of 2016. The Phase 3 clinical trial will enroll patients with CKD, with or without HF, who are taking RAAS inhibitors and are diagnosed with hyperkalemia, a common side effect that occurs in patients taking RAAS inhibitors. Based on discussions with the FDA, we believe we will be able to submit an application for RDX022 under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. 

Size of the hyperkalemia market 

Hyperkalemia is defined as the presence of blood potassium levels greater than 5.0mEq/L. Normal levels are 3.5 to 5.0 mEq/L. When hyperkalemia is severe, or above 7.0mEq/L, there is a significantly increased risk of death because of the potential for heart conductance problems. 

Hyperkalemia can be caused by a variety of sources. Kidney disease can result in the build-up of potassium in the blood. Also, certain drugs such as the common blood pressure medications known as RAAS inhibitors, or inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, can cause hyperkalemia. RAAS inhibitors, though quite effective for controlling blood pressure, are often significantly reduced in patients, such as in those with CKD and HF whose potassium levels are elevated because of the fear that elevated potassium can cause significantly worse problems than hypertension including sudden cardiac arrest in severe cases. 

According to a retrospective observational study of a national cohort of 246,000 veterans cared for in the Veterans Health Administration, about 21% and 42% of patients with CKD Stage 3b and Stage 4, respectively, had a hyperkalemic event during a 12-month period, suggesting that hyperkalemia affects about 900,000 individuals with CKD Stage 3b or Stage 4 in the United States. According to the United States Renal Data System 2014 Atlas of CKD &#38; ESRD, over 50% of CKD Stage 3b and Stage 4 patients are prescribed RAAS inhibitors because of their efficacy in controlling hypertension and success in slowing the clinical course of CKD. Additionally, according to the American Heart Association, 5.7 million Americans are living today with heart failure. Our proprietary research suggests that up to 16%, or approximately 900,000, of these patients had hyperkalemia during a 12-month period. Over half of heart failure patients are prescribed RAAS inhibitors. 

Despite the success of RAAS inhibitors in both of these populations, several published guidelines have suggested that physicians should reduce and possibly discontinue RAAS inhibitors in order to manage the risk of hyperkalemia in CKD and heart failure patients. The alternative medications used to control hypertension, including diuretics and calcium channel blockers, are significantly less effective than RAAS inhibitors, particularly in patients with failing kidneys and severe hypertension. According to the publication Market 

&#160;

Dynamix: Hyperkalemia recently released by Spherix Global Insights, U.S. cardiologists reported that of the patients who would benefit from RAAS inhibition, up to 38% of patients with heart failure and up to 55% of patients with both heart failure and CKD are being administered a sub-optimal dose or none at all, and nephrologists reported that at least one-third of patients who would benefit from RAAS inhibition receive a sub- optimal dose or none at all. We believe there is a strong medical need for new medications that control hyperkalemia in order to allow for continued use of RAAS inhibitors to control hypertension in these patient populations. 

An additional market not currently addressed by any product on the market is hyperkalemia in ESRD patients. Our proprietary research suggests that up to 48% of patients on dialysis have at least one intervention for hyperkalemia during a 12-month period despite being dialyzed, resulting in a 7% mortality rate. This suggests up to 200,000 patients with ESRD that could benefit from an agent that treats hyperkalemia. 

We are aware of at least two drugs approaching or on the market for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Veltassa (patiromer FOS), an oral, polymer-based potassium binder, was approved for marketing by the FDA in October 2015 and was just recently commercially launched by Relypsa. Additionally, a new drug application, or NDA, was submitted in June 2015 for a sodium zirconium cyclosilicate-based oral potassium binder being developed for treatment of hyperkalemia by AstraZeneca after its acquisition of ZS Pharma in December 2015. 

OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS 

Other product candidates in our pipeline include the following: 

RDX009 Program 

Our focus is the discovery and development of minimally-systemic TGR5 agonists that stimulate GLP-1 and GLP-2 secretion for various indications. In December 2015, we declared a development candidate for RDX009, and we currently expect to file an IND for RDX009 in the second half of 2016. We are evaluating RDX009 in animal models for its effect in multiple indications. 

TGR5 is a receptor present on the membrane of certain cells within the GI tract that responds to bile acids secreted in response to food. In the normal physiological response, binding of bile acids to TGR5 stimulates the production of hormones such as glucagon- like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2). GLP-1 is involved in maintaining insulin sensitivity and in aiding glucose and lipid metabolism. GLP-2 is involved in maintenance of the structural integrity of the gut as well as its growth. 

We believe that endogenous and local secretion of GLP-1 and GLP-2 triggered by the stimulation of TGR5 receptors by an oral TGR5 agonist may have significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of several conditions. An injectable, stabilized form of GLP-2, called teduglutide (Gattex), is marketed for short bowel syndrome and has been studied in Crohn&#146;s disease. GLP-2 is hypothesized to work in inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, such as Crohn&#146;s disease and ulcerative colitis, or UC, by stimulating the repair of the gut and improving the structural integrity of gut wall that is damaged in patients with IBD. Additionally, GLP-2 and its analogs have been shown to prevent chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in animal models. Injectable stabilized GLP-1 analogs that are commercially available, such as exenatide (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza), are commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, among other metabolic conditions. Additionally, injectable GLP-1 analogs are being evaluated in the treatment of NASH because they are known to improve lipid metabolism in the liver. In all of these cases, GLP-1 and GLP-2 analogs are injectable thus we believe an oral agent that can emulate these effects would be welcome. 

Historically one of the limitations for the development of TGR5 agonists has been the observation with systemic compounds that stimulation of TGR5 in the gallbladder results in excess gallbladder filling, potentially increasing the risk of gallstones. Utilizing our approach to design small molecules, we have created novel TGR5 agonist candidates that have extremely low systemic exposure and we have shown that these agents do not result in excess gallbladder filling in preclinical animal models. 

&#160;

We have selected a development candidate for the RDX009 program. This compound, in combination with a DPP-IV inhibitor, has demonstrated proof-of-concept in an animal efficacy model of IBD, and analogs of this compound have shown activity in animal models of chemotherapy-induced diarrhea and short bowel syndrome. We continue to evaluate the development candidate in several animal models of disease as we complete our pre-clinical studies with the intent of filing an IND in the second half of 2016. 

RDX013 Program 

Our RDX013 program is aimed at discovering and evaluating small molecule, orally-administered drug candidates that modulate the transport of potassium in the GI tract. Our agents will be designed to enhance potassium secretion or prevent potassium absorption in the colon and correct hyperkalemia disorders in CKD patients. We believe that specific potassium transporters in the intestines may serve as useful targets for our program. We believe that such agents may be used as stand-alone agents or used in combination with potassium binders to boost efficacy or to reduce the pill burden of the potassium binders. Several agents we have developed have demonstrated significant activity in animals. 

RDX011 Program 

We intend to leverage our knowledge of NHE3 inhibitors and their effect on phosphate management as we seek to further understand tenapanor&#146;s phosphate lowering mechanism of action. We also intend to evaluate new indications for tenapanor and other NHE3 inhibitors in order to exploit the unique capabilities and tools we have developed to modulate ion transport channels located on mucosal surfaces. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

As a normal course of business, we pursue composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents for our product candidates in key therapeutic areas. We also seek patent protection for broader structural and functional attributes of our product candidates that enable a minimally-systemic or minimally-systemic profile. 

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of our issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, which would result in substantial costs to us even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent&#146;s term 

&#160;

may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. 

In addition, in the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process occurring while the patent is in force. A patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaboration partners, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning the business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#146;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during the normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. 

NHE3 patents 

Our NHE3 patent portfolio is wholly owned by us. This portfolio includes three issued U.S. patents, two issued Japanese patents, and one issued Mexican patent. These issued patents cover the composition and methods of using tenapanor and are predicted, without extension or adjustment, to expire in 2029. We have related national patent applications pending in Europe, China, India, Israel and a number of other countries. Any patents issuing from these patent applications are also predicted without extension or adjustment to expire in 2029. Additional patent applications are pending in the United States covering the composition of or methods of using tenapanor, or its backup compounds. 

NaP2b Patents 

We have a portfolio of patents and patent applications claiming the compositions and methods of using our proprietary NaP2b inhibitor compounds. NaP2b is an intestinal transporter of dietary phosphorus. Our portfolio is wholly owned by us and includes four issued U.S. patents and three allowed U.S. applications covering the composition of or methods of using our NaP2b inhibitor compounds. The issued patents, and if issued, the allowed applications are predicted to expire in 2031. Numerous related patents have issued in Europe, Hong Kong and Japan Any patents resulting from these patent applications, if issued, are also predicted to expire in 2031. 

RDX022 

We have filed a PCT application covering the compositions and methods of using RDX022. 

RDX009 

We have filed a provisional application covering the compositions and methods of using our TGR5 agonists. 

&#160;

MANUFACTURING 

To date, we have relied upon third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and final drug product dosage forms of our potential drug candidates used as clinical trial material. We expect that we will continue to rely upon CMOs for the manufacture of our clinical trial materials for our own internal programs. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION/FDA 

The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and export and import of our product candidates. 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and the FDA&#146;s implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#146;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. 

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies, some performed in accordance with the FDA&#146;s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or commercial shipment of the drug. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical 

&#160;

trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

An independent IRB or ethics committee for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including the requirements for informed consent. 

All clinical research performed in the United States in support of an NDA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP and if the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. GCP includes review and approval by an independent ethics committee, such as an IRB, and obtaining and documenting the freely given informed consent of the subject before study initiation. If the applicant seeks approval of an NDA solely on the basis of foreign data, the FDA will only accept such data if they are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA, or if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or through other appropriate means. 

Clinical trials 

The clinical investigation of a new drug is typically conducted in three or four phases, which may overlap or be combined, and generally proceed as follows. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 1 : Clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 2 : Clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 3 : Clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#147;pivotal&#148; studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a 

&#160;

&#160; drug. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 4 : In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

The FDA, the IRB or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 

New drug applications 

The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. 

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to standard review NDAs of new molecular entities within ten months after the 60 day filing review period, or six months after the 60 day filing review period for priority review NDAs, but this timeframe is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 

Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished drug product, and sometimes the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, is manufactured, and will not approve the drug unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the drug unless compliance with cGCP requirements is satisfactory. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication 

&#160;

guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#146;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once the FDA approves an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the drug reaches the market. 

Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 

The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our drug candidates for the proposed indication, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Nonclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the drugs. After approval, certain changes to the approved drug, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA, but excluding efficacy supplements to an NDA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 

Other regulatory requirements 

Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our collaboration partners pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. 

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#146;s labeling and that 

&#160;

differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#146; communications regarding off-label use. 

Fraud and abuse laws 

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. These laws include but are not limited to, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Physician Sunshine Payment Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. 

The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and federal criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#147;cause&#148; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 

In addition to the laws described above, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, also imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#147;knowing failures&#148;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. The period 

&#160;

between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was the first reporting period and manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data by March 31, 2014, and will be required to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data during Phase 2 of the program (which begins in May 2014 and extends for at least 30 days). Thereafter, manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. 

Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal laws discussed above. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. There has also been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturers&#146; marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with such laws, which may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and perhaps federal, authorities. 

Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Due to the breadth of these laws, the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians and other healthcare providers might be challenged under such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#146;s attention from the operation of our business. 

Third-party coverage and reimbursement 

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial managed care providers. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for our product candidates, if approved, will be made on a payor by payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our future sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

In addition, in July 2010, CMS released its final rule to implement a bundled prospective payment system for the treatment of ESRD patients as required by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, or MIPPA. The bundled payment includes all renal dialysis services furnished for outpatient maintenance dialysis, including ESRD-related drugs and biologicals. The final rule delayed the inclusion of oral medications without intravenous equivalents in the bundled payment until January 1, 2014 and in April 2014, President Obama signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which further extends this implementation date to January 1, 2024. As a result of the recent legislation, beginning in 2024, ESRD-related drugs will be included in the bundle 

&#160;

and separate Medicare reimbursement will no longer be available for such drugs, as it is today under Medicare Part D. While it is too early to project the full impact bundling may have on the phosphate binder industry, the impact could potentially cause dramatic price reductions for tenapanor, if approved. 

Healthcare reform 

In March 2010, Congress passed and President Obama signed into law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a healthcare reform measure, often called, the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. 

The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer&#146;s Medicaid rebate liability; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expands access to commercial health insurance coverage through new state-based health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; requires manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#146;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, beginning January 2011; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; imposes a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell &#147;branded prescription drugs&#148; to specified federal government programs. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#146;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2 percent per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. In January 2013, the ATRA was enacted, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers. These new laws and the regulations and policies implementing them, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our products. 

Other regulations 

We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. 

&#160;
