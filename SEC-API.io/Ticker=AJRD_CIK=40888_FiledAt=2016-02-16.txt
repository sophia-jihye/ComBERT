Tactical Systems. Aerojet Rocketdyne is a designer, developer, and producer of propulsion and warhead systems for tactical missile systems. Our commitment to researching and developing safe, effective and affordable products enables us to provide our customers with optimal tactical propulsion and warhead solutions. Our tactical products have been successfully fielded on numerous active U.S. and international weapon system platforms. 

During fiscal 2015, we successfully delivered the first production units of the upgraded Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (&#8220;PAC-3&#8221;) Missile Segment Enhancement Solid Rocket Motor and Lethality Enhancement. We also successfully demonstrated a composite rocket motor case enhanced technology providing improved insensitive munitions for the Long Range Precision Fires rocket motor. Insensitive munitions are munitions that minimize hazardous reactions to unplanned mechanical shocks, fire, and impact by shrapnel and can still function as intended to destroy their targets. 

A subset of our key tactical missile propulsion systems programs include: Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (&#8220;GMLRS&#8221;), Javelin, PAC-3, Standard Missile, Tactical Tomahawk and Tube-launched Optically Wire-guided (&#8220;TOW&#8221;). &#160; 

Missile Defense and Strategic Systems. Aerojet Rocketdyne develops and manufactures liquid and solid divert and attitude control propulsion systems and booster motors for missile defense applications. We also develop and manufacture boost and post-boost rocket motors for strategic missiles. These systems provide launch capability and directional control for critical missile defense interceptors and for ground and sea-based strategic missiles . We develop and manufacture both solid and liquid propulsion systems for the DoD and our propulsion systems are used throughout the world. 

In fiscal 2015, we continued the development of the Standard Missile-3 IIA Throttling Divert and Attitude Control System (&#8220;TDACS&#8221;) program achieving critical program milestones. We are in full rate production of our Standard Missile-3 IB TDACS and delivered our 100 th &#32;unit to Raytheon, for delivery to the MDA. We are in full rate production for our Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (&#8220;THAAD&#8221;) boost motors and Divert and Attitude Control System (&#8220;DACS&#8221;) and delivered our 200 th &#32;THAAD boost motor and DACS propulsion systems. We also achieved several successful ground and flight test milestones for the Standard Missile-3 IIA, Standard Missile-3 IB, Ground Based Interceptor ("GBI") and THAAD programs, and continue our support of the critical return to flight for the Ground Based Missile Defense (&#8220;GMD&#8221;) Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (&#8220;EKV&#8221;) program. We completed the successful development of the alternate divert thrusters for the EKV and are progressing towards completing the qualification program and delivery of thrusters. We also completed the critical design review and design development testing of the alternate propellant tanks that will be used on both the EKV and Redesigned Kill Vehicle ("RKV") programs.

Defense Advanced Programs. Aerojet Rocketdyne&#8217;s defense advanced programs activity support the entire breadth of propulsion and energetic products within the defense products portfolio by developing robust processes and innovative technologies demanded by our customers, as well as new capabilities required in next generation weapon systems. Our capabilities include a hypersonic propulsion team with decades of experience pioneering the development of liquid and solid fueled propulsion technologies for supersonic and hypersonic systems, which resulted in the selection of the X-51A propulsion program as a finalist for the 2014 Collier Trophy Award. We maintain key positions on ground-breaking government hypersonic propulsion demonstration programs such as the Triple Target Terminator ("T3") program, which successfully demonstrated breakthroughs in innovative technologies related to variable flow ducted rocket ramjet. We have developed and demonstrated low Mach to hypersonic scramjet propulsion transition using turbine based combined cycle. This technology is critical for transitioning from low speed (subsonic) propulsion to high speed (hypersonic) propulsion in missile systems, applicable to the future SR-72 airplane. In support of Ground Based Strategic Deterrent ("GBSD") systems, which will provide new propulsion systems for all of our nation&#8217;s strategic nuclear land-based capability, we are defining the best propulsion options for all four stages by leveraging past successful developments as well as maturing new technologies and capabilities. 

The application of innovative solutions across multiple product lines, such as Selective Laser Melting/Additive Manufacturing has resulted in a cost reduction in many of our systems, but especially our hypersonic systems, removing a significant barrier in creating a major new market for this class of weapon systems. We have achieved significant results in extending the range and operability of next generation TDACS for future missile defense system upgrades. We are enabling enhanced capabilities in Missile Defense through Multiple Object Kill Vehicle ("MOKV") and RKV propulsion. We successfully completed an advanced mortar arena test, demonstrating the optimized warhead design and precision delivery that increases the range by up to 200 percent while minimizing collateral damage. In addition, two new areas have recently been added to our portfolio: (i) underwater warfare with a focus on advanced torpedoes, torpedo defense, and unmanned underwater systems, and (ii) unmanned aerial systems ("UAS") and counter UAS defense solutions. 

Relentless research, rapid prototyping, and development work continue to advance next generation propulsion enablers in tactical, strategic, and adjacent energetic markets. This combined with a renewed focus on early strategic partnerships with key prime contractors and new market entrants, present exciting new opportunities for Aerojet Rocketdyne.

Franchise technology demonstration programs and new product development efforts are featured to effectively transition our products to our core space markets. 

During fiscal 2015, we achieved a number of significant milestones on the NASA Space Launch System (&#8220;SLS&#8221;) and Commercial Crew programs. We completed the closeout activities of our J-2X engine which is slated to power the future upper stage of the heavy lift SLS. J-2X is an upgraded and modernized version of the original Apollo moon mission's engine. We also completed the first series of adaptation testing of the RS-25 engine and were awarded the follow-on restart of production activities. The RS-25 (formerly known as the Space Shuttle Main Engine - (&#8220;SSME&#8221;)) restart will recertify an updated version with higher capabilities and will be produced with modern manufacturing technologies. Finally, we completed final design of the reaction control thrusters for the Orion crew module and the jettison motor for the Launch Abort System and have initiated flight set production. The Orion system combined with SLS will return our nation to deep space flight capability. 

In 2015, we finalized the contract with Boeing to develop and qualify propulsion systems for the next generation commercial crew vehicle (Boeing&#8217;s CST-100 Starliner) that will provide human transportation to and from the International Space Station ("ISS") and potentially other low Earth orbit missions. Boeing&#8217;s CST-100 incorporates our crew module reaction control thrusters, service module propulsion system and tanks. 

Space advanced programs continued to mature critical technologies for our nation&#8217;s next generation of advanced hydrocarbon engines for future high-performance booster systems with the ability to eliminate the U.S. dependence on Russian-provided booster systems for National Security Space Launch. The new high performance AR1 engine completed preliminary design in December 2015 and is on-track to be qualified by 2019. Other leading edge technology development areas include next generation satellite and spacecraft high-power solar electric propulsion, &#8220;green&#8221; liquid propellant engines and nuclear space power systems.

Our Competitive Strengths 

Leadership in Propulsion &#32;- Our success is due in part to our ability to focus on the design, development and manufacture of products utilizing innovative, mission-enabling technology. For over 70 years, we have demonstrated a legacy of successfully meeting the most challenging missions by producing some of the world&#8217;s most technologically advanced propulsion systems for our customers. For example, our propulsion systems have flown on every NASA Discovery mission as well as every manned space mission since the inception of the U.S. space program. We also have powered nearly all of NASA&#8217;s human-rated launch vehicles to-date and powered space probes to nearly every planet in the solar system and have been a cornerstone to the U.S. space program since its inception. In addition, we have been a major supplier of a wide range of propulsion products to the DoD since the 1940s when we successfully developed and produced the first jet-assisted take off rockets for U.S. aircraft during World War II. 

Diversified and Well Balanced Portfolio &#32;- We have been and continue to be a pioneer in the development of many enabling technologies and products that have strengthened multiple branches of the U.S. military and enabled the exploration of space. We believe Aerojet Rocketdyne maintains a unique competitive position due to a strategic focus on creating and maintaining a broad spectrum of propulsion and energetic products assisted by the growing market demand for its innovative energy management technologies. Our propulsion systems power almost all of today&#8217;s medium and large payload rocket systems. We are the sole provider of most of the liquid upper and boost stage engines/motors on the SLS, Delta IV, and Atlas V launch vehicle systems. We have further capitalized on this foundation by bringing together &#8220;solid&#8221; and &#8220;liquid&#8221; propulsion teams and &#8220;cross-pollinating&#8221; critical product features and capabilities, thus exploiting potential product line synergies that enable us to offer our customers innovative, highly advanced solutions. 

High Visibility of Revenue with Multi-year Contracts and Sizable Backlog &#32;- A strong focus on our customers&#8217; highest priorities has been a critical factor in maintaining an enduring portfolio of products throughout major market cycles. The highly visible nature of our revenue comes from the long-term nature of the programs with which we are involved, our diverse and attractive contract base and our deep customer relationships. A substantial portion of our sales are derived from multi-year contract awards from major aerospace and defense prime contractors. In many cases, we operate under sole source contracts, some of which are follow-on contracts to contracts initially completed years ago and others have been sole source contracts since inception. High renewal rates, supported by our market leading technology provide us with a highly stable business base from which to grow. Our contract backlog (funded and unfunded) was $4.1 billion &#32;as of November 30, 2015 &#32;and our funded backlog, which includes only amounts for which funding has been authorized by a customer and a purchase order has been received, totaled $2.4 billion . 

Exceptional Long-Term Industry Relationships &#32;- We serve a broad set of customers and are major suppliers of propulsion products to top original equipment manufacturers such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and ULA, as well as to the DoD, NASA and other U.S. government agencies. We have a long history of partnering with their respective prime contractors and have developed close relationships with key decision-makers while working for a combined total of more than a century in the rocket and missile propulsion markets. We are, in many instances, approached by multiple prime contractors early in the bidding process, which is a testament to the strength of our relationships and technological leadership in the industry. We believe these long-term relationships and our reputation for performance enhance customer loyalty and provide us with key competitive advantages in winning new contracts for new programs as well as follow-on and derivative contracts for existing programs. 

Competition 

The competitive dynamics of our multi-faceted marketplace vary by product sector and customer as we experience many of the same influences felt by the broader aerospace and defense industry. The large majority of products we manufacture are highly complex, technically sophisticated and extremely hazardous to build, demanding rigorous manufacturing procedures and highly specialized manufacturing equipment. While historically these factors, coupled with the high cost to establish the infrastructure required to meet these needs, posed substantial barriers to entry, modern design tools and manufacturing techniques (additive manufacturing) available to new entrants with the ability to self-fund start-up as well as development costs has led to increased competition in space related markets. To date, the competition has been limited to a few participants who tend to be narrowly focused on products that are sub-elements of our overall product portfolio. For example, entrepreneurs such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who have been or are in the process of developing liquid fuel propulsion capabilities are primarily focused on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles and are not pursuing or participating in the missile defense or tactical propulsion business segments that make up a substantial portion of our overall business. These new entrepreneurs have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are therefore bringing pressure to bear on existing cost paradigms and manufacturing methodologies.

Industry Overview 

Our primary aerospace and defense customers include the DoD and its agencies, NASA, and the prime contractors that supply products to these customers. We are seeing more opportunities for commercial launch and in-space business. In addition, sales to our aerospace and defense customers that provide products to international customers continue to grow. However, we continue to rely on particular levels of U.S. government spending on propulsion systems for defense, space and armament systems, precision tactical weapon systems and munitions applications, and our backlog depends, in large part, on continued funding by the U.S. government for the programs in which we are involved. These funding levels are not generally correlated with any specific economic cycle, but rather follow the cycle of general public policy and political support for this type of funding. Moreover, although our contracts often contemplate that our services will be performed over a period of several years, the U.S. Congress must appropriate funds for a given program and the U.S. President must sign government budget legislation each government fiscal year (&#8220;GFY&#8221;) and may significantly increase, decrease or eliminate, funding for a program. A decrease in DoD and/or NASA expenditures, the elimination or curtailment of a material program in which we are or hope to be involved, or changes in payment patterns of our customers as a result of changes in U.S. government outlays, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. 

The Budget Control Act of 2011 established statutory limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, or budgets caps, for both defense and non-defense over the next 10 years. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 provided temporary relief to the Budget Control Act of 2011 cap levels in GFY 2014 and 2015 and eased sequestration spending cuts to the DoD and other federal agencies (e.g., NASA) for GFY 2014 and 2015, paving the way for eventual agreements on GFY 2014 and 2015 appropriations for all federal agencies. Similarly, in November 2015, the U.S. President signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, providing another two years of relief to the Budget Control Act cap numbers. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 covers both GFY 2016 and 2017 and allows for increased spending levels for DoD and other U.S. government agencies including NASA. This paved the way for the U.S. Congress to pass and the U.S. President to sign into law a $1.1 trillion &#8220;Omnibus&#8221; appropriations bill for GFY 2016, funding all government agencies. The defense portion of the bill provides $514.1 billion in base defense funding and $58.6 billion in overseas contingency operations. The base funding is $12.8 billion below the GFY 2016 budget request while the overseas contingency operations portion is $7.7 billion above the GFY 2016 budget request. The NASA portion contains a top line of $19.3 billion, a $1.3 billion increase over GFY 2015 level. 

Despite overall U.S. government budget pressures, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from funding in DoD and NASA priority areas. This view reflects the DoD&#8217;s strategic guidance report released in January 2012, and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (&#8220;QDR&#8221;) which affirms support for many of our core programs and explicitly states Missile Defense, Space, Nuclear Deterrence, and Precision Strike as key capabilities for the DoD to preserve. 

The NASA Authorization Act has again identified the SLS program as one of its top priorities in the NASA GFY 2016 budget. The SLS program also has enjoyed wide, bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. We maintain a strong relationship with NASA and our propulsion systems have been powering NASA launch vehicles and spacecraft since the inception of the U.S. space program. Our booster, upper stage and Orion vehicle propulsion systems are currently baselined on the new SLS vehicle and both upper stage and booster engines are in development for future SLS variants. Due to the 

retirement of the space shuttle fleet, U.S. astronauts are now dependent on Russian Soyuz flights for access to and from the ISS for the better part of this decade. NASA has been working to re-establish U.S. manned space capability as soon as possible through development of a new &#8220;space taxi&#8221; to ferry astronauts and cargo to the ISS. In 2014, Boeing&#8217;s CST-100 Starliner capsule, powered by Aerojet Rocketdyne propulsion, was selected by NASA to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. As Boeing&#8217;s teammate, Aerojet Rocketdyne will be providing the propulsion system for this new vehicle, thereby supplementing its work for NASA on the SLS designed for manned deep space exploration. In both instances, we have significant propulsion content and we look forward to supporting these generational programs for NASA. 

Major Customers

Contract Types 

Under each of its contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne acts either as a prime contractor, where it sells directly to the end user, or as a subcontractor, selling its products to prime contractors. Research and development contracts are awarded during the inception stage of a program&#8217;s development. Production contracts provide for the production and delivery of mature products for operational use. Aerojet Rocketdyne&#8217;s contracts are largely categorized as either &#8220;fixed-price&#8221; (largely used by the government for production-type contracts) or &#8220;cost-reimbursable&#8221; (largely used by the government for development-type contracts). During fiscal 2015 , approximately 61% &#32;of our Aerospace and Defense net sales were from fixed-price contracts, 33% &#32;from cost-reimbursable contracts, and 6% &#32;from other sales including commercial contracts. 

&#160; 

Fixed-price contracts are typically (i) fixed-price, (ii) fixed-price-incentive fee, or (iii) fixed-price level of effort contracts. For fixed-price contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne performs work for a fixed price and realizes all of the profit or loss resulting from variations in costs during contract performance. For fixed-price-incentive contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives increased or decreased fees or profits based upon actual performance against established targets or other criteria. For fixed- 

price level of effort contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne generally receives a structured fixed price per labor hour, dependent upon the customer&#8217;s labor hour needs. All fixed-price contracts present the risk of unreimbursed cost overruns potentially resulting in lower than expected contract profit margin and losses. 

Cost-reimbursable contracts are typically (i) cost plus fixed fee, (ii) cost plus incentive fee, or (iii) cost plus award fee contracts. For cost plus fixed fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne typically receives reimbursement of its costs, to the extent the costs are allowable under contractual and regulatory provisions, in addition to receiving a fixed fee. For cost plus incentive fee contracts and cost plus award fee contracts, Aerojet Rocketdyne receives adjustments to the contract fee, within designated limits, based on actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, performance, quality, and schedule. 

Some programs under contract have product life cycles exceeding ten years. It is typical for U.S. government propulsion contracts to be of relatively small contract value during development phases that can last from two to five years, followed by low-rate and then full-rate production, where annual funding can grow significantly. 

Government Contracts and Regulations 

U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (&#8220;FAR&#8221;), agency-specific regulations that supplement FAR, such as the DoD&#8217;s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustments, mandatory disclosure, and audit requirements. A contractor&#8217;s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, inability to bill and collect receivables from customers, and the assessment of penalties and fines that could lead to suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits, reviews, and investigations by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (&#8220;DCAA&#8221;), the Defense Contract Management Agency, and other similar U.S. government agencies. Such reviews include but are not limited to a contractor&#8217;s contract performance, compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards as well as the review of the adequacy of a contractor&#8217;s accounting systems, purchasing systems, property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management and accounting system. 

Regulations for U.S. government contracts provide for the cost of restructuring activities occurring after a business combination as unallowable costs unless we can demonstrate through an external restructure cost and savings proposal that the savings as a result of the business combination will be at least twice the external restructuring costs. 

The U.S. government&#8217;s ability to unilaterally modify or terminate a contract or to discontinue funding for a particular program at any time could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows. The cancellation of a contract, if terminated for cause, could also subject us to liability for the excess costs incurred by the U.S. government in procuring undelivered items from another source. If terminated for convenience, our recovery of costs would be limited to amounts already incurred or committed (including severance costs for terminated employees), and our profit would be limited based on the work completed prior to termination.

Total backlog includes both funded backlog (unfilled orders for which funding is authorized, appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer) and unfunded backlog (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated). Indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog. Backlog is subject to funding delays or program restructurings/cancellations which are beyond our control. Of our November 30, 2015 &#32;total contract backlog, approximately 39% , or approximately $1.6 billion , is expected to be filled within one year. 

Seasonality 

Aerojet Rocketdyne&#8217;s business is not subject to predictable seasonality. Primary factors affecting the timing of our sales include the timing of government awards, the availability of U.S. government funding, contractual product delivery requirements, customer acceptances, and regulatory issues. 

Appropriations bills for both DoD and NASA have become increasingly difficult for Congress to pass by the start of the GFY resulting in funding delays to many of our customers and, in turn, delays in contract awards received by us. This generally leads to a decrease in the number of new and follow-on awards in the first half of our fiscal year and an increase during the second half, which translates to varying levels of uncertainty in the timing of annual awards received by Aerojet Rocketdyne. 

Research and Development 

We view research and development efforts as critical to maintaining our leadership position in markets in which we compete. We maintain an active research and development effort supported primarily by customer funding. We believe that some customer-funded research and development expenditures that are subject to contract specifications may become key programs in the future. We believe customer-funded research and development activities are vital to our ability to compete for contracts and to enhance our technology base and future revenue growth. 

Our company-funded research and development efforts include expenditures for technical activities that are vital to the development of new products, services, processes or techniques, as well as those expenses for significant improvements to existing products or processes.

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

The national aerospace supply base continues to consolidate due to economic, environmental, and marketplace circumstances beyond our control. The loss of key qualified suppliers of technologies, components, and materials can cause significant disruption to our program performance and cost. 

&#160; Availability of raw materials and supplies has been generally sufficient. We sometimes are dependent, for a variety of reasons, upon sole-source or qualified suppliers and have, in some instances in the past, experienced difficulties meeting production and delivery obligations because of delays in delivery or reliance on such suppliers. We closely monitor sources of supply to ensure adequate raw materials and other supplies needed in our manufacturing processes are available. Further, as a U.S. government contractor, we are often required to procure materials from suppliers capable of meeting rigorous customer and government specifications. As market conditions change for these companies, they often discontinue materials with low sales volumes or profit margins. We are often forced to either qualify new materials or pay higher prices to maintain the supply. Although we have been successful in establishing replacement materials and securing customer funding to address specific qualification needs of the programs, we may be unable to continue to do so. 

The supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in solid propellant, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry and actual pricing is based on the total industry demand. The completion of the Space Shuttle Program reduced demand, resulting in significant unit price increases. In addition, the sole domestic source is evaluating strategic alternatives to its business; accordingly, we are evaluating alternate sources of supply to mitigate risks. In the majority of our contracts, we anticipated this price increase and incorporated abnormal escalation pricing language into our proposals and contracts. 

We are also impacted, as is the rest of the industry, by fluctuations in the prices and lead-times of raw materials used in production on various fixed-price contracts, particularly on multi-year programs. We continue to experience volatility in the price and lead-times of certain commodity metals, primarily steel and aluminum. The pricing of titanium mill products have reduced recently but remain well above historical levels. Additionally, we may not be able to continue to negotiate with our customers for economic and/or price adjustment clauses tied to commodity indices to reduce program impact. The DoD also continues to rigorously enforce the provisions of the &#8220;Berry Amendment&#8221; which imposes a requirement to procure certain 

strategic materials critical to national security only from U.S. sources. While availability has not been a significant issue, cost remains a concern as this industry continues to quote &#8220;price in effect&#8221; at time of shipment terms, increasing the cost risk to our programs. 

Intellectual Property 

Where appropriate, Aerojet Rocketdyne obtains patents in the U.S. and other countries for new and useful processes, machines, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvements thereof relating to its products and services. We use patents selectively both (i) to protect from an unauthorized third party making, using, selling, offering to sell and importing the claimed inventions of the patents, where the inventions might be accessible to competitors, such as mechanical designs or structures and (ii) to establish that we have made inventions in particular areas of relevant technologies and thus can prevent competitors from successfully claiming exclusive rights in the claimed inventions. A patent is maintained as long as the underlying invention has value in the market in which we compete. A patented invention incorporated into a product sold will typically be maintained to its expiration, which typically is approximately 20 years. We also rely on trade secret protection for financial, technical and personnel information that provides an economic competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete. Trade secrets that are protected under applicable state and federal laws are maintained in perpetuity. We rely more extensively on trade secrets to protect specific information whose details are not readily accessible to competitors, such as business strategies, manufacturing procedures, and personnel information. As our products and services typically embody complex systems that include many technologies, no single patent or trade secret is material to us. 

Real Estate 

We own approximately 11,500 acres of land in the Sacramento metropolitan area which we refer to as the Sacramento Land. Acquired in the early 1950s for our aerospace and defense operations, there were large portions used solely to provide safe buffer zones around hazardous operations. Modern changes in propulsion technology coupled with the relocation of certain of our propulsion operations led us to determine large portions of the Sacramento Land were no longer needed for operations. Consequently, our plan has been to reposition this excess Sacramento Land, re-entitle it for new uses, and explore various opportunities to optimize its value. 

Approximately 5,600 acres have been deemed excess, and we are in the process of entitling this excess land for new development opportunities under the brand name &#8220;Easton&#8221;. Within Easton, we currently have approximately 1,600 acres that are fully entitled and approximately 2,300 acres have received &#8220;limited entitlements.&#8221; Our remaining entitlement and infrastructure efforts are expected to increase the land value over its current value. The term &#8220;entitlements&#8221; is generally used to denote the set of regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for new requested uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each jurisdiction and each zoning proposal and may include permits, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals unique to the land. 

Easton continues to execute re-entitlement and pre-development activities, and to explore how to maximize value from Easton. Value creation and monetization may include outright sales and/or joint ventures with real estate developers, residential builders, and/or other third parties. Those parcels of land that have obtained the necessary entitlements for development or are otherwise suitable for sale were transferred to this subsidiary. Additional land may be transferred in the future as these or other requirements are achieved. 

Easton is located 15 miles east of downtown Sacramento, California along U.S. Highway 50, a key growth corridor in the region. We believe Easton has several competitive advantages over other areas, including several miles of freeway accessible frontage, one of the largest single-owner land tracts suitable for development in the Sacramento region, and desirable &#8220;in-fill&#8221; location surrounded by residential and business properties. The master plan reflects our efforts to make Easton one of the finest master-planned communities in the country. Easton will include a broad range of housing, office, industrial, retail, and recreational uses. This broad range of land uses will ensure long-term value enhancement of our excess land. 

Regarding our Glenborough at Easton and Easton Place projects, in fiscal 2015, we completed key permit requirements regarding open space agreements that better positioned this entitled project for monetization. We continue to have conversations with builders and developers regarding these projects. 

Regarding our Hillsborough at Easton project, we finalized the sale of the Hillsborough land in fiscal 2015 for a total purchase price of $57.0 million which was comprised of $46.7 million cash and $10.3 million of promissory notes. The total acreage covered by the Hillsborough land transaction was approximately 700 acres, of which approximately 550 acres was recognized as a sale in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. 

During fiscal 2015, we also made important strides in discussions with the City of Rancho Cordova regarding total impact fees and final terms surrounding a final development agreement for the Rio del Oro at Easton project. 

The new housing market and local economy in the Sacramento region are in recovery and we expect this trend to continue. We believe the long-term prospect for the Sacramento region represents an attractive and affordable alternative to the San Francisco Bay Area and other large metropolitan areas of California. We believe the Sacramento area demographics and 

the long-term real estate market fundamentals support our objective of creating value through new entitlements and the creation of Easton.

_________ 

(1) 

The environmentally restricted acreage described above is subject to restrictions imposed by state and/or federal regulatory agencies because of our historical propulsion system testing and manufacturing activities. We are actively working with the various regulatory agencies to have the restrictions removed as early as practicable, and the solutions to use these lands within Easton have been accounted for in the various land use plans and granted entitlements. See Note 9(c) in notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the federal and/or state environmental restrictions affecting portions of the Sacramento Land. 

(2) 

The term &#8220;entitled&#8221; is generally used to denote the set of local regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for requested uses. Required regulatory approvals vary with each land zoning proposal and may include permits, general plan amendments, land use master plans, zoning designations, state and federal environmental documentation, and other regulatory approvals unique to the land. The entitlement and development process in California is long and uncertain with approvals required from various authorities, including local jurisdictions, and in select projects, permits required by federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (&#8220;USFWS&#8221;), and others prior to construction. 

(3) 

The term &#8220;limited entitlements&#8221; is generally used to denote when a project receives a portion, but not all of the set of regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for requested uses, as described in Item 2 above. 

(4) The remaining 148 acres designated in Hillsborough will be transferred, per the completed Purchase and Sale contract, when the required environmental remediation work is completed. See Note 4(h) of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

(5) 

We believe that the operations land is adequate for our long-term needs. As we reassess needs in the future and as propulsion technology continues to advance, portions of this land may become available for entitlement. 

(6) 

We believe it will be several years before any of this excess Sacramento Land is available for future change in entitlement. Some of this excess land is outside the current Urban Services Boundary established by the County of Sacramento and all of it is far from existing infrastructure, making it uneconomical to pursue entitlement for this land at this time. 

Leasing &#38; Other Real Estate 

We currently lease approximately 0.4 million square feet of office space in Sacramento to various third parties . These leasing activities generated $6.3 million &#32;in revenue in fiscal 2015 . 

We also own approximately 580 acres of land in Chino Hills, California. This property was used for the manufacture and testing of ordnance. With the sale of our ordnance business in the mid-1990s, we closed this facility and commenced clean-up of the site. We continue to work with state regulators and the City of Chino Hills to complete those efforts. 

Environmental Matters 

Our current and former business operations are subject to, and affected by, federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes. Our policy is to conduct our business with due regard for the preservation and protection of the environment. We continually assess compliance with these regulations and we believe our current operations are materially in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. 

We review on a quarterly basis estimated future remediation costs and have an established practice of estimating environmental remediation costs over a fifteen year period, except for those environmental remediation costs with a specific contractual term. Environmental liabilities at the Baldwin Park Operable Unit (&#8220;BPOU&#8221;) site are currently estimated through the anticipated term of a new project agreement (the "Project Agreement"). There can be no assurance that the term of the new Project Agreement will not be longer than the term we estimated and, if so, we may be required to make an additional accrual to reflect the longer term. As the period for which estimated environmental remediation costs lengthens, the reliability of such estimates decreases. These estimates consider the investigative work and analysis of engineers, outside environmental consultants, and the advice of legal staff regarding the status and anticipated results of various administrative and legal proceedings. In most cases, only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated. In establishing our reserves, the most probable estimate is used when determinable; otherwise, the minimum amount is used when no single amount in the range is more probable. Accordingly, such estimates can change as we periodically evaluate and revise these estimates as new information becomes available. We cannot predict whether new information gained as projects progress will affect the estimated liability accrued. The timing of payment for estimated future environmental costs is influenced by a number of factors such as the regulatory approval process, and the time required for designing, constructing, and implementing the remedy. 

&#160; A summary of our recoverable amounts, environmental reserves, and range of liability, as of November 30, 2015 &#32;is presented below: &#160;

(1) 

Excludes the receivable from Northrop of $68.7 million &#32;as of November 30, 2015 related to environmental costs already paid (and therefore not reserved) by the Company in prior years and reimbursable under the Northrop Agreement (see below). 

Operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of operations. Most of our environmental costs are incurred by our Aerospace and Defense segment, and certain of these costs are allowable and allocable as reimbursable general and administrative costs allocated to our contracts with the U.S. government or reimbursable by Northrop, subject to an annual and a cumulative limitation. See Note 9(d) in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

On January 12, 1999, Aerojet Rocketdyne and the U.S. government implemented the October 1997 Agreement in Principle (&#8220;Global Settlement&#8221;) resolving certain prior environmental and facility disagreements, with retroactive effect to December 1, 1998. Under the Global Settlement, Aerojet Rocketdyne and the U.S. government resolved disagreements about an appropriate cost-sharing ratio with respect to the cleanup costs of the environmental contamination at the Sacramento and Azusa sites. The Global Settlement cost-sharing ratio does not have a defined term over which costs will be recovered. Additionally, in conjunction with the sale of the EIS business in 2001, Aerojet Rocketdyne entered into an agreement with Northrop (the &#8220;Northrop Agreement&#8221;) whereby Aerojet Rocketdyne is reimbursed by Northrop for a portion of environmental expenditures eligible for recovery under the Global Settlement, subject to an annual and a cumulative limitation. 

Pursuant to the Global Settlement, prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, approximately 12% of environmental costs related to Aerojet Rocketdyne&#8217;s Sacramento site and its former Azusa site were charged to the consolidated statements of operations. Subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, because our estimated environmental costs had reached the reimbursement ceiling under the Northrop Agreement, approximately 37% of such costs were expensed to the consolidated statements of operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, Aerojet Rocketdyne and the U.S. government executed an advance agreement revising the percent allocable to Northrop and the U.S. government (the "Advance Agreement"). As a result of this agreement, we increased the percent of recoverable environmental costs and allocated additional environmental costs to our Aerojet Rocketdyne business retroactive to December 1, 2013. We currently estimate approximately 24% of such costs will not likely be reimbursable and are expensed to the consolidated statements of operations. We are seeking to further amend our agreement with the U.S. government to increase the amount allocable to our U.S. government contracts; however, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in this pursuit. &#32; 

Allowable environmental costs are charged to our contracts as the costs are incurred. Because these costs are recovered through forward-pricing arrangements, the ability of Aerojet Rocketdyne to continue recovering these costs from the U.S. government depends on Aerojet Rocketdyne&#8217;s sustained business volume under U.S. government contracts and programs. 

Additionally, we are reviewing the percentage of Global Settlement environmental costs allocable to our Aerojet Rocketdyne business and Northrop. Any change in the percentage allocable will require approval from the U.S. government and, if received, this change may materially and favorably affect our results of operations and cash flows in the period received along with future periods. 

The inclusion of environmental costs in our contracts with the U.S. government impacts our competitive pricing; however, we believe that this impact is mitigated by driving improvements and efficiencies across our operations as well as our ability to deliver innovative and quality products to our customers. 

Under existing U.S. environmental laws, a Potentially Responsible Parties (&#8220;PRP&#8221; ), is jointly and severally liable, and therefore we are potentially liable to the government or other third parties for the full cost of remediating the contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites where we have been designated as a PRP by the Environmental Protection Agency or state environmental agencies. The nature of environmental investigation and cleanup activities requires significant management judgment to determine the timing and amount of any estimated future costs that may be required for remediation measures. Further, environmental standards change from time to time. However, we perform quarterly reviews of these matters and accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability, usually based on proportionate sharing, can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities have not been discounted to their present value as the amounts and timing of cash payments are not fixed or reliably determinable. 

We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal 2015 nor do we anticipate any material capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 and 2017. See Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis in Part II, Item 7 &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; of this Report for additional information. 

Additional information on the risks related to environmental matters can be found under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A. of this Report, including the material effects on compliance with environmental regulations that may impact our competitive position and operating results. 

Employees 

As of November 30, 2015 , 15% &#32;&#32;of our 4,823 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees and unions are good.
