 Item 1. Business 

GENERAL 

Lancaster Colony Corporation, an Ohio corporation, is a manufacturer and marketer of specialty food products for the retail and foodservice channels. We began our operations in 1961 as a Delaware corporation. In 1992, we reincorporated as an Ohio corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 37 West Broad Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215 and our telephone number is 614-224-7141. 

In recent years, our strategy has shifted away from operating businesses in a variety of industries towards emphasizing the growth and success we have achieved in our Specialty Foods business. Consistent with this strategy, on January 30, 2014, we sold effectively all of the net operating assets of our candle manufacturing and marketing operations. This sale marked the divestiture of our last remaining non-food business. The financial results of these operations for 2014, previously included in our Glassware and Candles segment, are reported as discontinued operations.

We also manufacture and sell other products pursuant to brand license agreements, including Olive Garden &#174; &#32;dressing, Jack Daniel&#8217;s &#174; &#32;mustards and Hungry Girl &#174; &#32;flatbreads. A portion of our sales are products sold under private label to retailers, distributors and restaurants primarily in the United States. Additionally, a small portion of our sales are dressing packets, frozen specialty noodles, pasta and flatbreads sold to industrial customers for use as ingredients or components in their products. 

Sales are made to retail and foodservice channels. The vast majority of the products we sell in the retail and foodservice channels are sold primarily through sales personnel, food brokers and distributors. We have strong placement of products in U.S. grocery produce departments through our refrigerated salad dressings, vegetable and fruit dips, and croutons. Our flatbread products are generally placed in the deli section of the grocery store. We also have products typically marketed in grocery aisles involving shelf-stable salad dressing, slaw dressing, dry egg noodles and croutons. Within the frozen aisles of grocery retailers, we also have prominent market positions of frozen yeast rolls, garlic breads and egg noodles. Products we sell in the foodservice channel are often custom-formulated and include salad dressings, sandwich and dipping sauces, frozen breads and yeast rolls. 

Net sales attributable to McLane Company, Inc. (&#8220;McLane&#8221;), a wholesale distribution subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., totaled 19% , 18% &#32;and 18% &#32;of consolidated net sales for 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Net sales attributable to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (&#8220;Wal-Mart&#8221;) totaled 16% , 16% &#32;and 17% &#32;of consolidated net sales for 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales during these years. Although we have the leading market share in several product categories, all of the markets in which we sell food products are highly competitive in the areas of price, quality and customer service. 

We continue to rely upon our strong retail brands, innovation expertise, geographic and channel expansion and customer relationships for future growth. Our category-leading retail brands and commitment to new product development helps drive increased consumer demand in our retail channel. In the foodservice channel, we grow our business with established customers and pursue new opportunities by leveraging our culinary skills and experience to support the development of new products and menu offerings. Strategic acquisitions are also part of our future growth plans, with a focus on fit and value. 

A significant portion of our product lines is manufactured at our 15 food plants located throughout the United States. Certain items are also manufactured and packaged by third parties located in the United States, Canada and Europe. 

Efficient and cost-effective production remains a key focus. In 2015 we completed a significant processing capacity expansion at our Horse Cave, Kentucky dressing facility to help improve throughput and meet demand for our dressing products. 

Our sales are affected by seasonal fluctuations, primarily in the fiscal second quarter and the Easter holiday season when sales of frozen retail products tend to be most pronounced. The impacts on working capital are not significant. We do not utilize any franchises or concessions. In addition to the owned and licensed trademarks discussed above, we also own and operate under innumerable other intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, formulas, proprietary trade secrets, technologies, know-how processes and other unregistered rights. We consider our owned and licensed intellectual property rights to be essential to our business.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

The estimated amount spent during each of the last three years on research and development activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles was less than 1% of net sales. 

BACKLOG 

Orders are generally filled in three to seven days. We do not view the amount of backlog at any particular point in time as a meaningful indicator of longer-term shipments. 

COMPETITION 

All the markets in which we sell products are highly competitive. We face competition from a number of domestic and foreign manufacturers of various sizes and capabilities. We compete with competitor branded products, as well as an increasing presence of retailers&#8217; store branded products. Our ability to compete depends upon a variety of factors, including the position of our branded goods within various categories, product quality, product innovation, promotional and marketing activity, pricing and our ability to service customers. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection laws. Based upon available information, compliance with these laws and regulations did not have a material effect upon the level of capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position in 2016 &#32;and is not expected to have a material impact in 2017 . 

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS 

As of June 30, 2016 &#32;we had 2,700 &#32;employees, 21% &#32;of which are represented under various collective bargaining contracts. 7% &#32;of our employees are represented under a collective bargaining contract that expired on April 30, 2016. We are currently renegotiating this contract. 9% &#32;of our employees are represented under a collective bargaining contract that will expire within one year. While we believe that labor relations with all our employees are satisfactory, a prolonged labor dispute or an organizing attempt could have a material effect on our business and results of operations. 

FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES 

Over 95% of our products are sold in the United States. Foreign operations and export sales have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the future based upon existing operations. We do not have any fixed assets located outside of the United States. 

RAW MATERIALS 

During 2016 , we obtained adequate supplies of raw materials and packaging. We rely on a variety of raw materials and packaging for the day-to-day production of our products, including soybean oil, various sweeteners, eggs, dairy-related products, flour, various films and plastic and paper packaging materials. 

We purchase the majority of these materials on the open market to meet current requirements, but we also have some fixed-price contracts with terms generally one year or less. See further discussion in our &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section below and our contractual obligations disclosure in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#8220;MD&#38;A&#8221;). Although the availability and price of certain of these materials are influenced by weather, disease and the level of global demand, we anticipate that future sources of supply will generally be available and adequate for our needs.
