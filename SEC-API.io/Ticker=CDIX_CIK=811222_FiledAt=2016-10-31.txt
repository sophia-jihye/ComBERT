 Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

History of the Business 

&#160; 

Legacy Card Company (&#8220;Legacy&#8221;) was formed as a Limited Liability Company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted from a California Limited Liability Company to a Nevada Corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff International, Inc. (&#8220;Cardiff&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a publicly held corporation presently incorporated in Florida.

&#160;

In the first quarter of 2013, it was decided to restructure Cardiff into a holding company that adopted a new business model known as &#34;Collaborative Governance,&#34; a form of governance enabling businesses to take advantage of the power of a public company. Cardiff began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, and high return investments, all designed to pay a dividend to our shareholders. The reason for this strategy was to protect our shareholders by acquiring profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management that had the ability to offer a return to investors. The plan is to establish new classes of preferred stock to streamline voting rights, negate debt, and acquire new businesses. By December of 2013, we had negated more than 90% of all its debt; by July of 2014, we had completed the acquisition of three businesses: We Three, LLC; Romeo&#8217;s NY Pizza; and Edge View Properties, Inc. We delayed the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#8220;Form 10-K&#8221;) for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to difficulty obtaining information from another acquisition, which was subsequently unwound.

&#160;
