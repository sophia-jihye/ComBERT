Summary 

&#160; 

Seafarer Exploration Corp. ("the Company" or "Seafarer"), a Florida Corporation, was incorporated on May 28, 2003. The Company formerly operated under the name Organetix, Inc. (&#8220;Organetix&#8221;). The Company's principal business plan is to develop the infrastructure to engage in the archaeologically-sensitive exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. The business plan also includes in-depth archival research and translation of historical documents from archives and repositories from around the world. In addition to the research is ongoing education of all independent contractors involved in operations with the Company. College level courses in archaeology are being taught by a Ph.D. to all independent contractors in an ongoing program to help educate the independent contractors in context, work methodology, documentation, and conservation. 

The exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks is by nature extremely speculative, and there is a high degree of risk inherent in this type of business venture. The exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks involves a multi-year, multi stage process and it may take several years and/or be prohibitively expensive to locate and recover valuable artifacts, if any are ever located at all, from historic shipwreck sites. It is possible that the Company will never locate any valuable artifacts from historic shipwreck sites. 

There are a number of other significant challenges and risks regarding this type of business venture that make it extremely risky with potential that the Company could fail. If the Company were to cease its operations, it is likely that there would be complete loss of all capital invested in and/or borrowed by the Company to date. 

No Revenue and Operating Losses 

The Company expects to continue to incur significant operating losses and to generate negative cash flows from operating activities while developing the infrastructure necessary for the exploration and recovery of historic shipwreck sites and for actually exploring historic shipwreck sites. &#160; 

The Company&#8217;s ability to eliminate operating losses and to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future will depend upon a variety of factors, many of which it is unable to control. Based on our historical rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available cash in less than one month from April 13, 2016. If the Company is unable to implement its business plan successfully, it may not be able to eliminate operating losses, generate positive cash flow, or achieve or sustain profitability, which would materially and adversely affect its business, operations, and financial results, as well as its ability to make payments on its debt obligations, and the Company may be forced to cease its operations. 

General 

The Company&#8217;s principal business plan is to develop the infrastructure to engage in the archaeologically-sensitive exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks including archaeological research around the world. The business plan also includes in-depth archival research and translation of historical documents from archives and repositories from different parts of the world. In addition to the research is ongoing education of all independent contractors involved in operations with the Company. College level courses in archaeology are being taught by a Ph.D. to all independent contractors in an ongoing program to help educate the independent contractors in context, work methodology, documentation, and conservation. This type of business venture is extremely speculative in nature and there is a tremendous amount of risk that any capital invested in and/or borrowed by the Company could be lost. 

&#160; 

It has been estimated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (&#8220;UNESCO&#8221;) that there are over three million undiscovered shipwrecks around the world and a few of these shipwrecks were lost with verifiable cargoes that contained valuable materials, including artifacts and treasure. However, many of these shipwrecks may have very little archaeological or historical value, and furthermore, a very high percentage of these shipwrecks would not have been carrying valuable cargo including artifacts or treasure of any kind. 

The exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks involves a multi-year, multi stage process. It may take many years and/or be prohibitively expensive to locate, if any are ever located at all, and recover valuable artifacts from historic shipwrecks. Locating and recovering valuable artifacts is very difficult and the probability that the Company will locate valuable artifacts or treasure is extremely remote. If the Company is not able to locate artifacts or treasure with significant value, then there is high probability that the Company will face adverse consequences. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Item 1. Business - continued 

Underwater recovery operations are inherently difficult and dangerous and may be delayed or suspended by weather, sea conditions or other natural hazards. In addition, even though sea conditions in a particular search location may be somewhat predictable, the possibility exists that unexpected conditions may occur, and already have occurred, that adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations. It is also possible that natural hazards may prevent or significantly delay search and recovery operations. 

In addition to natural hazards there are constant repair and maintenance issues with treasure salvage vessels which tend to be older vessels that were originally used in other industries that have been converted for use in shipwreck exploration and recovery. The repairs, maintenance and upkeep of this type of vessel, and in particular the Company&#8217;s main salvage vessel, is very time consuming and expensive and there may be significant periods of vessel down time that result from lack of financing to make repairs to the vessel. 

Furthermore, there are very strict international, federal and state laws that govern the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. While the Company has been able to obtain some permits, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure future permits or enter into agreements with government agencies in order to explore and salvage historic shipwrecks. There is a substantial risk that government entities may enact legislation that is so strict that any recovery of artifacts and cargo from historic shipwrecks will be nearly impossible. Additionally, permits and agreements with governmental agencies to conduct historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations are expensive, in terms of both direct costs and ongoing compliance costs. It is also entirely possible that the Company will not be successful in obtaining title or permission to excavate certain wrecks. It is possible that permits that are sought for potential future international projects may never be issued, and if issued, may not be legal or honored by the entities that issued them. 

Even if the Company is able to obtain permits for shipwreck projects there is a possibility that the shipwrecks may have already been salvaged or may not be found, or may not have had anything valuable on board at the time that they sank. It is the Company&#8217;s intent to find shipwrecks which research suggest were not salvaged, but there can be no absolute guarantee of previous salvage. In the event that valuable artifacts are located and recovered, it is possible that the cost of recovery will be greater than the value of the artifacts recovered. It is also possible that other entities, including both private parties and governmental entities, will assert conflicting claims and challenge the Company&#8217;s rights to the recovered artifacts. 

Moreover, there is the possibility that should the Company be successful in locating and salvaging artifacts that have significant archeological and/or monetary value that a country whose ship was salvaged may attempt to claim ownership of the artifacts by pursuing litigation. In the event that the Company is able to make a valid claim to artifacts or other items at a shipwreck site there is a risk of theft of such items at sea, both before or after the recovery or while the artifacts are in transit to a safe destination, as well as when stored in a secured location. Such thefts may not be adequately covered by insurance. Based on a number of these and other potential issues the Company could spend a great deal of time and invest a large sum in a specific shipwreck project and receive very little or no salvage claim or revenue for its work. 

&#160; 

There are a number of significant issues and challenges including, but not limited to, government regulation and/or the Company&#8217;s inability to secure permits and contracts, lack of financing, lack of revenue and cash flow and continued losses from operations that make the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks a speculative and risky business venture. There is also significant expense involved in research and ongoing educational programs. Research expenses involve paying scientists for translations, dues and fees for various historical entities such as archives, travel and accommodations, and research materials. There is a possibility that the Company will be forced to cease its operations if it is not successful in eventually locating valuable artifacts. If the Company were to cease its operations, then it is likely that there would be complete loss of all capital invested in or borrowed by the Company. As such, an investment in Seafarer is extremely speculative and of exceptionally high risk. 

There is currently a limited trading market for our securities. We cannot assure when and if an active-trading market in our shares will be established, or whether any such market will be sustained or sufficiently liquid to enable holders of shares of our common stock to liquidate their investment in our company. The sale of unregistered and restricted securities by current shareholders, including shares issued to consultants and shares issued to settle convertible promissory notes and to settle debt, may cause a significant drop in the market prices of the Company&#8217;s securities. 

Accordingly, an investment in our securities is highly speculative and extremely risky and should only be considered by those investors who do not require liquidity and who can afford to suffer a total loss of their investment. An investor should consider consulting with professional advisers before making an investment in securities.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

There are a number of competing entities who are engaged in various aspects of the exploration and salvage of historic shipwrecks, and in the future other competitors may emerge. Some of these companies are publicly traded companies and there are a number of small private companies, as well as some loosely affiliated groups and individuals, who claim to be in this business as well. Many of these entities may be better capitalized and may have greater resources to devote to the pursuit of locating and salvaging historic shipwrecks. Many of these competing entities may also have significantly more experience than the Company in the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. The Company is at a material competitive disadvantage as compared to competing entities that are better capitalized, have more resources and/or who possess greater experience in the business. 

The expenses associated with being a small publicly traded company engaged in the historic shipwreck recovery business are very prohibitive. The cost of operations may include the cost of buying or leasing a vessel, regular vessel maintenance and upkeep, ongoing vessel repairs due to wear and tear and damage by natural or human causes, docking fees, fuel, upgrades, equipment costs, personnel costs, insurance, registration costs, permitting, temporary lodging and provisions for divers and other personnel, etc. In addition to the operations expenses, a publicly traded company also incurs the significant recurring costs of maintaining publicly traded status, which include, but are not limited to administrative, accounting, audit, executive, legal, etc. These combined expenses are particularly burdensome for a smaller public company. The recurring expenses associated with being a publicly traded company focused on the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks may cause the Company to be at a significant competitive disadvantage when compared to some of its competitors who are private companies or compared to its competitors who are larger public companies. 

Lack of Revenues and Cash Flow/Significant Losses from Operations 

The exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks involves a multi-year, multi stage process and it may be many years before any revenue is generated from exploration and recovery activities, if ever. The Company believes that it may be years before it is able to generate any cash flow from its operations, if any are ever generated at all. Without revenues and cash flow the Company does not have any steady cash flow to rely on to pay its expenses. The Company relies on outside financing in the form of equity and debt and it is possible that the Company may not be able to obtain outside financing in the future. If the Company is not able to obtain financing it would more than likely be forced to cease operations and all of the capital that has been invested in the Company or borrowed by the Company could be lost. 

&#160; 

The Company has experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since inception. The Company&#8217;s losses from operations were $1,057,364 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $1,164,744 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company believes that it will continue to generate losses from its operations for the foreseeable future. 

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

There are very strict international, federal and state laws that govern the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to secure permits or enter into agreements with government agencies in order to explore and salvage historic shipwrecks, although the Company has secured permits in the past. There is a substantial risk that government entities may enact legislation that is so strict that any recovery of artifacts and cargo from historic shipwrecks will be nearly impossible. Additionally, permits and agreements with governmental agencies to conduct historic shipwreck exploration and recovery operations are expensive, both in terms of direct and ongoing compliance costs. It is possible that permits that are sought for potential future international projects may never be issued, and if issued, may not be legal or honored by the entities that issued them. 

The laws and regulations regarding the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks in waters controlled by the State of Florida are complex. A large amount of time and expense is required to comply with the existing laws and regulations. The State of Florida has, in the past, proposed new rules and regulations regarding the exploration and recovery of shipwrecks in Florida waters. The Company believes any new rules and regulations that are implemented into law would likely increase the cost of compliance and potentially force the Company to cease its operations. It is possible that the State of Florida may enact additional laws that ultimately make it impossible to conduct business as a commercial shipwreck exploration and recovery firm. It may also be possible that the State of Florida attempts to enact legislation that altogether bans the commercial exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks in State controlled waters. 

There is a possibility that new governmental regulations could be enacted at any time at the international, federal or state level that would make it impossible for the Company to continue to attempt to locate and salvage historic shipwrecks. Governmental regulation at all levels may substantially increase the costs and expenses incurred by the Company to obtain permits and agreements and comply with the regulations and represent a very significant risk to the Company and all companies engaged in the commercial exploration and recovery of historical shipwrecks. There is a possibility that governmental regulation could be enacted that would make it impossible for the Company to conduct commercial exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks anywhere in the world. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Item 1. Business - continued 

&#160; 

There are also strict environmental regulations associated with the exploration and recovery of historical shipwrecks. In order to explore and salvage shipwrecks that are located in state controlled waters, the Company must obtain permission from both federal authorities and state environmental agencies in order to conduct operations. There is always the possibility that the Company could be denied access to a historic shipwreck site based on federal or state environmental concerns. 

Litigation 

The Company has been engaged in various litigations (See &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; below). Although no negative outcomes are expected by management, a negative outcome in these actions could affect the Company&#8217;s business. We could be subject to future litigations that could materially affect our ability to operate our business, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Historic Shipwreck Exploration and Recovery in Florida 

The full time diving season for historic shipwreck exploration and recovery in Florida waters is generally considered to be the summer months, from approximately the middle of May through Labor Day, although good weather conditions may allow operations to extend into the fall and winter months at certain historic shipwreck sites. Inclement weather and hazardous ocean conditions may hamper year round historical shipwreck exploration and recovery efforts in Florida waters. It is the Company&#8217;s intention to work continuously all year, as in years past. 

Other factors that may hinder the Company&#8217;s ability to conduct year round operations include a lack of financing, the expiration of permits and agreements or the need to renew or enter into permits and agreements with various governmental or quasi governmental agencies, and the inability to locate and retain skilled, competent and experienced personnel. During down times, the Company's operations personnel may, among other duties, spend time researching sites, reviewing site plans, maps, charts, and other related information and performing maintenance, overhaul, cleaning, etc. 

Juno Beach Shipwreck Site 

The Company has previously performed exploration and recovery operations at what it believes to be a shipwreck site located off of the coast of Florida in northern Palm Beach County, more specifically in an area known as &#8220;Juno Beach&#8221; (the &#8220;Juno Beach Shipwreck&#8221;). The Company believes that it is possible that the Juno Beach shipwreck site may potentially contain remnants of a sunken 1500s ship; however, the Company does not have definitive evidence of the ship&#8217;s country of origin. Due to the fact that the Company does not currently have sufficient data to positively identify the potential Juno Beach shipwreck, or its country of origin, it is not possible to determine whether or not the ship was originally carrying cargo of any significant value. To date the Company has not located the main body of a shipwreck at the Juno Beach site, only shipwreck material and remnants including pottery, porcelain, cannon balls, musket balls, ballast stones, nails, spikes, wood and scattered pieces of a sunken ship. The Company has determined that a large part of the magnetometer survey that was previously provided to the Company by Tulco has an area that was intentionally deleted and it is management&#8217;s intention to complete a magnetometer survey of the entire deleted area. 

It is also possible that a ship began to break up on the site but the body of the ship actually sank in another area that is outside of the designated Juno Beach site and all that was left on the Juno Beach site were scattered remnants of the original ship that have little or no archeological or actual value. There is a possibility that there are no artifacts of significant value located on the Juno Beach shipwreck site. The chance that the Company will ultimately recover valuable artifacts or treasure from the Juno Beach shipwreck site is remote. Currently the permit with the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research (&#8220;FBAR&#8221;) is being renewed in the name of Seafarer Exploration Corp under a judge&#8217;s order. 

Furthermore, some of the historical ships from the 1500s to the 1700s that sank off of the coast of Florida were not carrying treasure or other valuable cargo. It is possible that the cargo the ship was originally carrying, if any, had little or no value at the time that the ship sank. Many ships of this period were supply ships that carried cargo such as food stores, water, supplies, etc., and if found, this type of cargo would more than likely be completely worthless in modern times. 

Additionally, there is a large amount of overburden covering portions of the Juno Beach Shipwreck site, and in the highly unlikely scenario that there are valuable artifacts located on the site, it may be extremely challenging to recover them due to the degree of difficulty in being able to dig deep enough under the sand to access them. There is a possibility that the Company will never recover any artifacts or cargo of any significant value from the Juno Beach Shipwreck site. It is management&#8217;s intention to complete a magnetometer survey of the entire deleted area. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Item 1. Business - continued 

&#160; 

On June 18, 2013, Seafarer began litigation against Tulco Resources, LLC, in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough County, Florida. Such suit was filed against Tulco for breach of contract, equitable relief and injunctive relief. Tulco was the party holding the rights under an admiralty claim to a shipwreck site at Juno Beach, Florida. Tulco and Seafarer had entered into contracts in March 2008, and later renewed under an amended agreement on June 11, 2010. Such permit was committed to by Tulco to be an obligation and contractual duty to which they would be responsible for payment of all costs in order for the permit to be reissued. Such obligation is contained in the agreement of March 2008 which was renewed in the June 2010 agreement between Seafarer and Tulco. Tulco made the commitment to be responsible for payments of all necessary costs for the gaining of the new permit. Tulco never performed on such obligation, and Seafarer during the period of approximately March 2008 through April 2012 had endeavored and even had to commence a lawsuit to gain such permit which was awarded in April 2012. Seafarer alleges in their complaint the expenditure of large amounts of shares and monies for financing and for delays due to Tulco&#8217;s non-performance. Seafarer seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief for the award of all rights held by Tulco to Seafarer. As of March 24, 2014, Seafarer, through Counsel with the assistance of a licensed investigator, established there was no party or individual to be served from Tulco due to the death of the former Manager, and having no other legal person or entity to serve, has established that it will seek the entry of a default judgment, and final judgment for award of all rights to such site for contractual and other rights held by Tulco. Seafarer gained a default and final Judgment on such matter on July 23, 2014. Although there are no guarantees that a new, updated permit will be issued, Seafarer is now working with the State of Florida for the renewed permit to be in Seafarer&#8217;s name and rights only, with Tulco removed per the Order of the Court. On March 4, 2015, the Court awarded full rights to the Juno site to the Company, erasing all rights of Tulco Resources. Seafarer does not currently have an active permit to work the Juno Beach site. 

&#160; 

It is possible that in the future, the Company will only be able to periodically explore and salvage the Juno Beach site due to vessel repairs and a lack of financing. There may be extended periods of down time where the Company is not performing any operations at the site. 

&#160; 

The Juno Beach Shipwreck site is a speculative project as far as the potential for the Company to ever locate valuable artifacts or treasure. The Company has recovered various artifacts it believes are interesting. Seafarer has not located artifacts and/or treasure of any significant value from the Juno Beach Shipwreck site, although Seafarer has not searched in the deleted area. There is also possibility that there are no artifacts of significant value located at the Juno Beach shipwreck site. Even if there are valuable artifacts and/or treasure located at the site, recovering them may be extremely difficult or impossible due to a variety of challenges that include, but are not limited to; inclement weather, hazardous ocean conditions, large amounts of sand that cover large areas of the site, lack of the necessary equipment to be able to dig deep enough into the sand, ongoing maintenance and repair issues with the Company&#8217;s main salvage vessel, permitting issues and/or a lack of financing, etc. The chance that the Company will ultimately recover valuable artifacts or treasure from the Juno Beach shipwreck site is still questionable, however the possibility exists. 

Moreover, the Company does not currently have sufficient data to positively identify the potential Juno Beach shipwreck, or its country of origin, and it is therefore not possible to determine whether or not the ship was originally carrying cargo of any significant value. Only remnants including pottery, porcelain, cannon balls, musket balls, ballast stones, nails, spikes, wood and scattered pieces of a sunken ship have been located to date; no main shipwreck body has been located, although, Seafarer has not searched in the deleted area. It is also possible that a ship began to break up on the site but the main body of the ship actually sank in another area that is outside of the designated Juno Beach site area and all that was left on the Juno Beach site were scattered remnants of the original ship that have little or no archeological or actual value. 

North Florida Shipwreck Site 

There is a purported historic shipwreck site in the waters off of Brevard County Florida that the Company desires to explore. In February 2013, the Company signed an agreement with a third party who has previously explored this site for the right to explore the site. It is the Company's plan to request a recovery permit from the State of Florida for the site as soon as the research design report is completed and management determines it is the right course of action. The Company may choose to pursue a recovery permit only in area one of the Brevard County site, based on future findings. If a recovery permit is granted and the requisite environmental permits are obtained, then the Company plans to salvage the site in an archeologically sensitive manner. An archeologist with the technical skills, knowledge, and experience from around the world has been hired to help insure the integrity of the work. There are a significant number of challenges inherent in the exploration and salvage of historic shipwrecks, including the possibility that the Company will never find artifacts of value at the site. &#160; 

In 2014 the Company performed various exploration and recovery operations at this site, including leasing two vessels to work with alongside its main salvage vessel. The Company was hampered from performing extensive operations on the site by poor weather conditions during the fall/winter months in 2014 and so far in 2015. The Company plans to begin extensive operations on the site as soon as the weather permits in 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Item 1. Business - continued 

&#160; 

The Company regularly reviews opportunities to perform exploration and recovery operations at purported historic shipwreck sites; however, the Company does have specific plans to perform exploration and recovery operations at other shipwreck sites at the present time. The Company is actively reviewing other potential historic shipwreck sites for possible exploration and recovery. Should the Company decide that it will pursue exploration and salvage activities at other potential shipwreck sites it may be necessary to obtain salvage permits as well as environmental permits. 

Certain Agreements 

&#160; 

On March 1, 2014, Seafarer entered into a partnership and ownership with Marine Archaeology Partners, LLC, with the formation of Seafarer&#8217;s Quest, LLC. Such LLC was formed in the State of Florida for the purpose of permitting, exploration and recovery of artifacts from a designated area on the east coast of Florida. Such site area is from a defined, contracted area by a separate entity, which a portion of such site is designated from a previous contracted holding through the State of Florida. Under such agreement, Seafarer is responsible for costs of permitting, exploration and recovery, and is entitled to 60% of such artifact recovery. Seafarer has a 50% ownership, with designated management of the LLC coming from Seafarer. Further actions toward the permitting have been taken for such site and the Company and partnership are awaiting the review of such permit request by the State of Florida. As of December 31, 2015, the partnership has had no operations. 

Florida Division of Historical Resources Agreements/Permits 

As previously noted on its form 8-K filed on May 9, 2011, the Company and Tulco received a 1A-31 Recovery Permit from the Florida Division of Historical Resources. The Recovery Permit was active through April 25, 2014. The Permit authorizes Seafarer to dig and recover artifacts from the designated site at Juno Beach, Florida. It will be necessary for the Company to obtain a renewal to the Recovery Permit for the Juno Beach shipwreck site in order to continue to perform exploration and recovery work at the site. Currently the permit with the FBAR may eventually be renewed in the name of Seafarer Exploration Corp. under a judge&#8217;s order, however the Company is currently pursuing other projects and this project is not the primary focus of the Company&#8217;s efforts at this time. The permit had not been issued as of the filing of this report. 

On July 28, 2014 the Company&#8217;s partnership with Marine Archeological Partners, LLC, Seafarer&#8217;s Quest, LLC received a 1A-31 Exploration Permit with a Dig and Identify modification (the &#8220;Permit&#8221;) from the Florida Division of Historical Resources for an area identified off of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Permit is active for three years from the date of issuance.
