Product Development Strategy 

&#160;

Abeona is focused on developing and delivering gene therapy and plasma-based products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases. A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death. More than 25 million Americans and 30 million Europeans have one. While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million); and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life. These rare diseases are often poorly diagnosed, very complex, and have no treatment or not very effective treatment&#8212;over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment. However, most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes&#8212;80% are genetic in origin and can present at any stage of life. We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.

&#160;

Developing Next Generation Gene Therapy 

&#160;

Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a potential therapy to treat a disease. In many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient's cells. The healthy, functional copy of the therapeutic gene then helps the cell function correctly. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a &#34;vector&#34;, often a &#8220;naked&#8221; virus, which is used to transfer the DNA to the inside of cells within the body. Gene therapy can be delivered by a direct injection, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Once inside cells, the correct DNA is expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of missing or defective protein, which in turn is proposed to treat the patient's underlying disease and can provide long-term benefit.

&#160;

Abeona is developing next generation adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies. Viruses such as AAV are utilized because they have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application, and can be purified in large quantities at high concentration. Unlike AAV vectors found in nature, the AAV vectors used by Abeona have been genetically-modified such that they do not replicate. Although the preclinical studies in animal models of disease demonstrate the promising impact of AAV-mediated gene expression to affected tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle, our programs use a specific virus that is capable of delivering therapeutic DNA across the blood brain barrier and into the central nervous system (CNS) and the somatic system (body), making them attractive for addressing lysosomal storage diseases which have severe CNS manifestations of the disease.

&#160;

Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. These diseases are characterized by progressive accumulation of storage material within the lysosomes of affected cells, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction. Multiple tissues ranging from musculoskeletal and visceral to tissues of the central nervous system are typically involved in disease pathology. Since the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to manage some LSDs, general clinical outcomes have significantly improved; however, treatment with infused protein is lifelong and continued disease progression is still evident in patients. Thus, AAV-based gene therapy may provide a viable alternative or adjunctive therapy to current management strategies for LSDs.

&#160;

Our initial programs are focused on LSDs such as Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIA and IIIB. Also known as Sanfilippo syndromes type A and type B, MPS III is a progressive neuromuscular disease with profound CNS involvement. Our lead product candidates, ABO-101 and ABO-102, have been developed to replace the damaged, malfunctioning enzymes within target cells with the normal, functioning version. ABO-201 is a similar product, using an AAV to deliver the correct lysosomal gene that is defective in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Delivered via a single injection, these drugs are only given once.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

ABO-101 for MPS III B and ABO-102 for MPS III A (Sanfilippo syndrome) 

&#160;

Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III (Sanfilippo syndrome) is a group of four inherited genetic diseases, described as type A, B, C or D, which cause enzyme deficiencies that result in the abnormal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (sugars) in body tissues. MPS III is a lysosomal storage disease, a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. The incidence of MPS III (all four types combined) is estimated to be 1 in 70,000 births.

&#160;

Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules used in the building of connective tissues in the body. There is a continuous process in the body of replacing used materials and breaking them down for disposal. Children with MPS III are missing an enzyme called heparan sulfate which is essential in breaking down the used mucopolysaccharides. The partially broken down mucopolysaccharides remain stored in cells in the body causing progressive damage. Babies may show little sign of the disease, but as more and more cells become damaged, symptoms start to appear.

&#160;

In MPS III, the predominant symptoms occur due to accumulation within the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord, resulting in cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and eventual death. To date, there is no cure for MPS III and treatments are largely supportive.

&#160;

Abeona is developing next generation AAV-based gene therapies for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome), which involves a one-time delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the central nervous system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause the disease.

&#160;

After a single dose in Sanfilippo preclinical models, ABO-101 and ABO-102 induced cells in the CNS and peripheral organs to produce the missing enzymes which helped repair the damage caused to the cells. Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in Sanfilippo syndrome have demonstrated functional benefits that remain for months after treatment. A single dose of ABO-101 or ABO-102 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects that remained months after drug administration, increased neuromuscular control and increased the lifespan of animals with MPS III over 100% one year after treatment compared to untreated control animals. These results are consistent with studies from several laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A and B. In addition, safety studies conducted in animal models of Sanfilippo syndromes have demonstrated that delivery of AB0-101 or AB0-102 are well tolerated with minimal side effects.

&#160; 

ABO-201 for Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (JNCL) (or Juvenile Batten Disease (JBD)) 

&#160;

ABO-201 (AAV CLN3) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective CLN3 gene to cells of the central nervous system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause JNCL. JNCL is a rare, fatal, autosomal recessive (inherited) disorder of the nervous system that typically begins in children between 4 and 8 years of age. Often the first noticeable sign of JNCL is vision impairment, which tends to progress rapidly and eventually result in blindness. As the disease progresses, children experience the loss of previously acquired skills (developmental regression). This progression usually begins with the loss of the ability to speak in complete sentences. Children then lose motor skills, such as the ability to walk or sit. They also develop movement abnormalities that include rigidity or stiffness, slow or diminished movements (hypokinesia), and stooped posture. Beginning in mid- to late childhood, affected children may have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), heart problems, behavioral problems, and difficulty sleeping. Life expectancy is greatly reduced. Most people with juvenile Batten disease live into their twenties or thirties. As yet, no specific treatment is known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of JNCL disease.

&#160;

JNCL disease is the most common form of a group of disorders known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Collectively, all forms of NCL affect an estimated 2 to 4 in 100,000 live births in the United States. NCLs are more common in Finland, where approximately 1 in 12,500 individuals are affected; as well as Sweden, other parts of northern Europe, and Newfoundland, Canada.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Most cases of JNCL disease are caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene, which is the focus of our AAV-based gene therapy approach. These mutations disrupt the function of cellular structures called lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that normally digest and recycle different types of molecules. Lysosome malfunction leads to a buildup of fatty substances called lipopigments and proteins within these cell structures. These accumulations occur in cells throughout the body, but neurons in the brain seem to be particularly vulnerable to damage. The progressive death of cells, especially in the brain, leads to vision loss, seizures, and intellectual decline in children with JNCL disease.

&#160;

ABO-301 for Fanconi Anemia (FA) 

&#160;

ABO-301 (AAV FANCC) is an AAV-based gene therapy which has shown promising preclinical efficacy in delivery of a normal copy of the defective gene to cells of the hematopoietic or blood system with the aim of reversing the effects of the genetic errors that cause Fanconi anemia (FA). FA is a rare (1 in 160,000) pediatric, autosomal recessive (inherited) disease characterized by multiple physical abnormalities, organ defects, bone marrow failure, and a higher than normal risk of cancer. The average lifespan for people with FA is 20 to 30 years.

&#160;

The major function of bone marrow is to produce new blood cells. In FA, a DNA mutation renders the FANCC gene nonfunctional. Loss of FANCC causes patient skeletal abnormalities and leads to bone marrow failure. FA patients also have much higher rates of hematological diseases, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or tumors of the head, neck, skin, gastrointestinal system, or genital tract. The likelihood of developing one of these cancers in people with FA is between 10 and 30 percent. Aside from bone marrow transplantation (BMT) there are no specific treatments known that can halt or reverse the symptoms of FA. Reparing fibroblast cells in FA patients with a functional FANCC gene is the focus of our AAV-based gene therapy approach.

&#160;

Using a novel CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) system, researchers used a protein-RNA complex composed of an enzyme known as Cas9 bound to a guide RNA molecule that has been designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. The RNA molecules guide the Cas9 complex to the location in the genome that requires repair. CRISPR-Cas9 uniquely enables surgically efficient knock-out, knock-down or selective editing of defective genes in the context of their natural promoters, unlocking the potential to treat both recessive and dominant forms of genetic diseases. Most importantly, this approach has the potential to allow more precise gene modification.

&#160;

Plasma-based Therapeutics using the SDF&#8482; technology platform 

&#160;

Abeona&#8217;s proprietary Salt Diafiltration Process&#8482; (SDF) focuses on ethanol-free extraction of therapeutic biologics from human plasma. Plasma biologics are biopharmaceutical proteins extracted, purified, and formulated from human blood plasma by the use of biotechnological processing techniques including precipitation, diafiltration, affinity chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography. These products are rendered virus-safe by means of chemical treatment, nanofiltration, and pasteurization. Plasma biologics primarily address indications arising from genetic deficiencies, which are increasingly being identified by means of newly available rapid and low-cost diagnostic genetic tests. Examples of plasma biologics include Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (also known as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, A1PI), Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG), Anti-Hemophilic Factor VIII (AHF) and Albumin.

&#160;

Plasma biologics are currently obtained from human plasma by a fractionation process known as the Cohn Cold Ethanol Fractionation Process (Cohn Process), which was developed prior to World War II to provide a stable solution of human albumin for the rapid treatment of hemorrhagic shock on the battlefield. This process employs various concentrations of ethanol combined with adjustments of pH, ionic strength, and temperature to bring about the necessary separations by precipitation. Ethanol can inactivate many of the plasma proteins.

&#160;

In contrast to the highly denaturing Cohn Process, Abeona&#8217;s patented SDF&#8482; method involves a short two-step, ethanol-free salt precipitation process optimized to extract a wide range of therapeutically useful biologic proteins from human blood plasma. SDF&#8482; enables the production of higher yields of these proteins compared with the Cohn Process.

&#160;

PTB-101 SDF Alpha&#8482; (alpha-1 protease inhibitor) for emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to severe congenital deficiency of A1PI (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency) 

&#160;

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a rare (1 in 1,500 to 3,500) genetic (inherited) autosomal disorder that may cause lung disease from an inability to neutralize the enzyme neutrophil elastase and liver disease from retained misfolded protein. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency occurs worldwide, but its prevalence varies by population. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is also known as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor (A1PI).

&#160;

About 10 percent of infants with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver disease, which often causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice). Approximately 15 percent of adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop liver damage (cirrhosis) due to the formation of scar tissue in the liver. Signs of cirrhosis include a swollen abdomen, swollen feet or legs, and jaundice. Individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are also at risk of developing a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.

&#160;

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is inherited with an autosomal codominant pattern, which means that two different versions of the gene may be active (expressed), and both versions contribute to the genetic trait. The most common version (allele) of the SERPINA1 gene, called M, produces normal levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. Most people in the general population have two copies of the M allele (MM) in each cell. Other versions of the SERPINA1 gene lead to reduced levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. For example, the S allele produces moderately low levels of this protein, and the Z allele produces very little alpha-1 antitrypsin. Individuals with two copies of the Z allele (ZZ) in each cell are likely to have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Those with the SZ combination have an increased risk of developing liver and lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

&#160;

It is estimated that about 200,000 individuals in the United States and Europe have severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. However, only about 5% of this number have been diagnosed as symptoms caused by this deficiency are very similar to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from non-genetic causes. Only about 1&#8211;2% of COPD patients have severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD as group of airflow-limited diseases including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. While severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can lead to or exacerbate all forms of COPD, it is considered to be the dominant cause of Panacinar Emphysema, a form of emphysema which causes gradual destruction of all lung aveolii.

&#160;

PTB-101 SDF Alpha&#8482; (alpha1-proteinase inhibitor) for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (Alpha-1) 

&#160;

Abeona is developing PTB-101 SDF Alpha&#8482; (alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor) for chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with clinically evident panacinar emphysema and other forms of COPD due to severe deficiency of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor.

Polymer Hydrogel Technology (PHT&#8482;) 

&#160; 

MuGard &#174; (mucoadhesive oral wound rinse) approved for mucositis, stomatitis, aphthous ulcers, and traumatic ulcers 

&#160;

MuGard &#174; is our marketed product for the management of oral mucositis, a frequent side-effect of cancer therapy for which there is no other established treatment. MuGard, a proprietary nanopolymer formulation, has received marketing clearance from the FDA in the US as well as Europe, China, Australia, New Zealand and Korea. We launched MuGard in the U.S. in 2010 and licensed MuGard for commercialization in the U.S. to AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMAG) in 2013. We licensed MuGard to RHEI Pharmaceuticals, N.V. (RHEI) for China and other Southeast Asian countries in 2010; Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Hanmi) for South Korea in 2014; and Norgine B.V. (Norgine) for the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, Australia and New Zealand in 2014.

&#160;

ProctiGard&#8482; (mucoadhesive oral wound rinse) approved for rectal mucositis and radiation proctitis 

&#160;

ProctiGard&#8482; received 510(K) marketing clearance from the FDA on July 22, 2014 for the treatment of symptomatic management of rectal mucositis. ProctiGard is our product for the treatment of radiation proctitis, a frequent side effect of radiation treatment to the pelvic region. Radiation proctitis, or RP, is the inflammation and damage to the lower portion of the colon after exposure to x-rays or ionizing radiation as part of radiation therapy. RP is most common after treatments for cancer, such as cervical, colon and prostate cancer. RP can be acute, occurring within weeks of initiation of therapy, or can occur months or years after treatment. We intend to commercialize ProctiGard in a manner similar to the commercialization of MuGard, which may include confirmatory clinical trials, with the objective of commercialization in collaboration with marketing partners globally.

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We believe that the value of technology both to us and to our potential corporate partners is established and enhanced by our broad intellectual property positions. Consequently, we have already been issued and seek to obtain additional U.S. and foreign patent protection for our products, including those under development and for new discoveries. Patent applications are filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and, when appropriate, with the Paris Convention&#8217;s Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Countries (most major countries in Western Europe and the Far East) for our inventions and prospective products. 

&#160; 

We have a strategy of maintaining an ongoing line of patent continuation applications for each major category of patentable carrier and delivery technology. By this approach, we are extending the intellectual property protection of our basic targeting technology and initial agents to cover additional specific carriers and agents, some of which are anticipated to carry the priority dates of the original applications. 

&#160; 

Gene licensed patents 

We have secured an exclusive license through Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital to the ABO-101 and ABO-102 patent portfolios for developing treatments for patients with Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A and Type B. This portfolio comprises one patent family: &#8220;Products and methods for delivery of polynuleotides by adeno-associated virus for lysosomal storage disorders&#8221;. Additionally, we have secured FDA Orphan drug designation for both Sanfilippo A and B, which will provide 7 years of post-launch market exclusivity for both ABO-101 and ABO-102 in the U.S. ABO-101 and ABO-102 are also eligible for 12 years of Biologics exclusivity upon approval in the US and 10 years of exclusivity in the EU upon marketing authorization. We will be seeking Orphan Drug Status within the EMA, which will grant 10 years of post-market exclusivity in the European Union.

&#160;

We licensed the rights to two patents (62/092,501 and 62/146,793) with an exclusive, worldwide, licensing agreement with the UNeMed Corporation. The patents are &#8220;Compositions and Methods for the Treatment of Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis&#8221; and &#8220;Gene Therapy for Juvenile Batten Disease&#8221; for an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of juvenile Batten disease.

&#160;

We licensed one patent (62/000,590), &#8220;Method for Editing a Genetic Sequence&#8221; with an exclusive, worldwide, licensing agreement with the University of Minnesota for an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and other rare blood diseases.

&#160;

We licensed two patents (13/594,773 and EPO 12756603.2) with a nonexclusive license agreement with Stanford University for an AAV delivery vector for the treatment of FA and rare blood disease platform.

&#160; 

Plasma based patents 

We licensed our SDF patents from Licensor issued U.S. Patents #7,879,331, #7,879,332, and #8,293,242, the last of which expires in September 2025. We have also licensed issued patents in Europe, China and Australia and pending applications in Canada and India. SDF patents from Licensor the last of which expires in September 2025.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, principally by the FDA, and, to a lesser extent, by other federal and state agencies as well as comparable agencies in foreign countries where registration of products will be pursued. Although a number of our formulations incorporate extensively tested drug substances, because the resulting formulations make claims of enhanced efficacy and/or improved side effect profiles, they are expected to be classified as new drugs by the FDA. 

&#160; 

The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal, state and foreign statutes and regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, shipping and record keeping of our products. The FDA has the authority to approve or not approve new drug applications and inspect research, clinical and manufacturing records and facilities. 

&#160; 

Among the requirements for drug approval and testing is that the prospective manufacturer&#8217;s facilities and methods conform to the FDA&#8217;s Code of Good Manufacturing Practices regulations, which establishes the minimum requirements for methods to be used in, and the facilities or controls to be used during, the production process. Such facilities are subject to ongoing FDA inspection to insure compliance. 

&#160; 

The steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be produced and marketed in the U.S. include preclinical tests, the filing of an Investigational New Drug (&#8216;&#8216;IND&#8217;&#8217;) application with the FDA, which must become effective pursuant to FDA regulations before human clinical trials may commence, numerous phases of clinical testing and the FDA approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) prior to commercial sale. 

&#160; 

Preclinical tests are conducted in the laboratory, usually involving animals, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the potential product. The results of preclinical tests are submitted as part of the IND application and are fully reviewed by the FDA prior to granting the sponsor permission to commence clinical trials in humans. All trials are conducted under International Conference on Harmonization, good clinical practice guidelines. All investigator sites and sponsor facilities are subject to FDA inspection to insure compliance. Clinical trials typically involve a three-phase process. Phase 1 the initial clinical evaluations, consists of administering the drug and testing for safety and tolerated dosages and in some indications such as cancer and HIV, as preliminary evidence of efficacy in humans. Phase 2 involves a study to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication and to determine optimal dosage and dose interval and to identify possible adverse side effects and risks in a larger patient group. When a product is found safe, and initial efficacy is established in Phase 2, it is then evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 3 trials consist of expanded multi-location testing for efficacy and safety to evaluate the overall benefit-to-risk index of the investigational drug in relationship to the disease treated. The results of preclinical and human clinical testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for approval to commence commercial sales. 

&#160; 

The process of forming the requisite testing, data collection, analysis and compilation of an IND and an NDA is labor intensive and costly and may take a protracted time period. In some cases, tests may have to be redone or new tests instituted to comply with FDA requests. Review by the FDA may also take considerable time and there is no guarantee that an NDA will be approved. Therefore, we cannot estimate with any certainty the length of the approval cycle. 

&#160; 

We are also governed by other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, employment practices, as well as environmental protection. 

&#160;

License Agreements 

&#160;

Gene therapy license agreements 

On May 15, 2015, we acquired Abeona Therapeutics LLC which had a an exclusive license through Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital to the AB-101 and AB-102 patent portfolios for developing treatments for patients with Sanfilippo Syndrome Type A and Type B. This portfolio comprises 1 patent family: &#8220;Products and methods for delivery of polynuleotides by adeno-associated virus for lysosomal storage disorders&#8221;. Additionally, Abeona has secured FDA Orphan drug designation for both Sanfilippo A and B, which will provide 7 years of post-launch market exclusivity for both ABX-A and ABX-B in the U.S. Abeona will be seeking Orphan Drug Status within the EMA, which will grant 10 years of post-market exclusivity in the European Union. 

&#160; 

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On June 5, 2015, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide, licensing agreement with the UNeMed Corporation, the technology transfer and commercialization office for the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) in Omaha, Nebraska, for an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of juvenile Batten disease. We licensed the rights to two patents (62/092,501 and 62/146,793). Under the terms of the licensing agreement, we paid a license fee of $75,000 and will pay milestone payments on certain milestone events. Commencing with the first commercial sale of licensed products a royalty will be paid. Terms of the agreement require we execute a sponsored research agreement with UNMC focused on additional efficacy studies within 12 months. 

&#160; 

On October 14, 2015 we entered into a sponsored research agreement with UNMC to support ongoing AAV/CLN3 projects in the amount of $215,000. 

&#160; 

On June 5, 2015, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide, licensing agreement with the University of Minnesota for an AAV gene therapy for the treatment of patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and other rare blood diseases. We licensed one patent (62/000,590), Method for Editing a Genetic Sequence. Under terms of the licensing agreement, we paid a license fee of $80,000, will pay an additional license fee of $50,000, will pay annual maintenance fees and a royalty fee with the first commercial sale of licensed products. 

&#160; 

On September 17, 2015, we entered into a nonexclusive license agreement with Stanford University for an AAV delivery vector for the treatment of FA and rare blood disease platform. This license augments the University of Minnesota agreement. We licensed two patents (13/594,773 and EPO 12756603.2). Under terms of the licensing agreement, we paid a license fee of $25,000, will pay annual maintenance fees and a royalty fee with the first commercial sale of licensed products. 

&#160; 

Plasma-based therapeutics license agreements 

On September 22, 2014, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide, licensing agreement with Licensor to obtain rights to utilize and to sub-license to other pharmaceuticals firms, its patented methods for the extraction of therapeutic biologics from human plasma. Under the terms of the licensing agreement, as amended on January 23, 2015, we paid a license fee of $1 million in cash, will pay $4,000,000 in cash or 1,096,151 shares of our common stock in 2017, a regulatory approval milestone payment of 513,375 shares of our common stock upon the first FDA regulatory approval of a drug derived from the Licensor&#8217;s proprietary SDF process, and a tiered royalty on annual net sales of plasma fractions produced with Licensor&#8217;s proprietary SDF process. 

&#160; 

We believe that Licensor&#8217;s proprietary fractionation process is expected to significantly enhance yields of key value blood proteins, including A1PI, expanding market opportunities, while greatly enhancing margins. The Company obtained rights to utilize and sub-license to other pharmaceutical firms the recently patented improved methods for the extraction of therapeutic biologics from human plasma. We believe that Licensor&#8217;s lead product, A1PI, offers a low-risk, high revenue, short time to market respiratory product for treatment of inherited COPD (pulmonary emphysema), among other genetic A1PI deficiencies. Additionally, the ability to extract several additional therapeutically useful and important proteins, due to the process being less destructive than historical fractionation processes, may enable us to seek new therapeutic applications and address high-value-added orphan indications. 

&#160;

MuGard license agreements 

On June 6, 2013 we entered into an exclusive license agreement with AMAG related to the commercialization of MuGard in the U.S. and its territories. Under the terms of the licensing agreement, we received an upfront licensing fee of $3.3 million and will receive a tiered, double-digit royalty on net sales of MuGard in the licensed territories. AMAG also purchased our existing MuGard inventory. The $3.3 million license fee is accounted for as deferred revenue and is recognized over ten years, which is the life of the license agreement. The license term expires June 6, 2023. The license can also terminate in the event of breach by either us or AMAG or by AMAG at anytime with 180 days prior notice of termination. 

&#160; 

On March 11, 2014, we announced we had entered into an exclusive license agreement with Hanmi related to MuGard commercialization in South Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront licensing fee and double digit royalties on sales of MuGard in the licensed territory. The license term expires February 26, 2024.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals and other product areas where we may develop and market products in the future. Most of our potential competitors are large, well established pharmaceutical, chemical or healthcare companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than are available to us. Additionally, many of our potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with our product lines. Our potential products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions to be addressed by our developments, technological advances affecting the cost of production, or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our potential competitors. Our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of such developments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting research activities and seeking patent protection and may commercialize products on their own or with the assistance of major health care companies in areas where we are developing product candidates. We are aware of certain development projects for products to treat or prevent certain diseases targeted by us, and the existence of these potential products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed by us. 

&#160; 

Gene therapy competition 

The gene therapy industry is highly competitive and driven by several large competitors including Bluebird, Voyager, Regenx, Spark, Dimension, Avalanche, Uniqure, and Lysogene. We face competition from both US based and international based producers of plasma products who may have greater access to capital, production facilities and resources for both research and development as well as commercialization. 

&#160; 

Plasma-based therapeutics competition 

The plasma therapeutics industry is highly competitive and driven by several large competitors including Baxter International, Inc. (&#8220;Baxter&#8221;), CSL Behring (&#8220;CSL&#8221;) and Grifols SA (&#8220;Grifols&#8221;). Each of these groups produce A1PI under the name of the following, Baxter (Aralast, license of Glassia from Kamada), CSL (Zemairia) and Grifols (Prolastin) Other regional competitors include, but are not limited to, BPL, Kedrion, LFB Group SA, and Octapharma AG. We face competition from both US based and international based producers of plasma products who may have greater access to capital, production facilities and resources for both research and development as well as supplies of plasma. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, plasma derived products also face competition from products that are not derived from plasma, and other courses of treatment. 

&#160; 

MuGard competition 

ActoGeniX N.V., Alder Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Applied Protein Sciences, LLC, Avaxia Biologics, Inc., BioAlliance Pharma S.A., BMG Pharma s.r.l., Camurus AB, DARA BioSciences, Inc. EUSA Pharma, Galera Therapeutics, Inc. Maya Biotech Ltd., NephRx, Piramal Healthcare Ltd., Soligenix, Inc. and Synedgen are developing products to treat mucositis that may compete with our mucoadhesive liquid technology. Products which are marketed to treat mucositis include Caphosol by EUSA Pharma, Gelclair by DARA BioSciences, Inc., Episil by Camurus AB, and Kepivance by Biovitrum. 

&#160; 

Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources, including larger research and development, marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, our competitors may successfully develop technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that we are developing or which would render our technology and future products obsolete and noncompetitive. 

&#160; 

10&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition, some of our competitors have greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical and clinical trials and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Drugs resulting from our research and development efforts or from our joint efforts with collaborative partners therefore may not be commercially competitive with our competitors&#8217; existing products or products under development. 

&#160; 

In the area of advanced drug delivery, which is the focus of our early stage research and development activities, a number of companies are developing or evaluating enhanced drug delivery systems. We expect that technological developments will occur at a rapid rate and that competition is likely to intensify as various alternative delivery system technologies achieve similar if not identical advantages. 

&#160; 

Even if our products are fully developed and receive required regulatory approval, of which there can be no assurance, we believe that our products can only compete successfully if marketed by a company having expertise and a strong presence in the therapeutic area. Consequently, we do not currently plan to establish an internal marketing organization. By forming strategic alliances with major and regional pharmaceutical companies, management believes that our development risks should be minimized and that the technology potentially could be more rapidly developed and successfully introduced into the marketplace. 

&#160;

Plasma Technologies LLC License (&#8220;Licensor&#8221;) 

On September 22, 2014, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide licensing agreement with Licensor to obtain rights to utilize and to sub-license its patented methods for the extraction of therapeutic biologics from human plasma. Plasma biologics are bio-pharmaceutical proteins extracted, purified, and formulated from human blood plasma by the use of biotechnological processing techniques including precipitation, diafiltration, affinity chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography. Because plasma biologics are biosimilar, they are less likely than recombinant or transgenic proteins to cause toxic or other adverse reactions, or cause adverse immunological responses such as the stimulation of inhibitors in recipients. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the licensing agreement, as amended on January 23, 2015, we paid a license fee of $1 million in cash, will pay $4,000,000 in cash or 1,096,151 shares of our common stock in 2017, a regulatory approval milestone payment of 513,375 shares of our common stock upon the first FDA regulatory approval of a drug derived from the Licensor&#8217;s proprietary SDF process, and a tiered royalty on annual net sales of plasma fractions produced with Licensor&#8217;s proprietary SDF process.
