Corporate Overview

We are formerly a craft brewing company that has since transitioned to become a pure-play healthy functional beverage company. Formerly, as a craft brewer, we won major industry awards for quality, but as one of more than 3,500 craft brewers all vying for distribution, the opportunity to capitalize on the fast-growing healthy functional beverage category, led us to recently sell our micro-brewing assets to focus on growing our recently acquired b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha brand of products. See further discussion below under " Acquisition of Assets Related to the Kombucha Tea Business ".

American Brewing Company, Inc. was formed under the laws of the State of Washington on April 26, 2010. We amended our articles of incorporation on October 11, 2011 in order to change our capital structure and authorize 100,000 shares of voting stock common stock and 100,000 shares of non-voting common stock. We again amended our articles of incorporation on September 25, 2013 to authorize 50,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Currently, 250,000 shares of the preferred stock are classified as Series A Preferred Stock and 300,000 shares of the preferred stock are classified as Series B Preferred Stock. As part of the recapitalization and amendment to our articles of incorporation on September 25, 2013, we also converted its corporate entity from an "S" Corporation to a "C" Corporation.

Through September 30, 2015, we were a brewery and a micro-brewing company based out of Edmonds, Washington. We also manufacture and sell b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha, a gluten free, organic certified, sparkling kombucha tea. On October 1, 2015 (the "Closing Date"), we sold our assets and various liabilities related to our brewery and micro-brewing operations and are no longer in that business after the Closing Date. We recognized the sale of our brewery and micro-brewing operations as a discontinued operation, in accordance with accounting guidelines. See further discussion below under "Discontinued Operations Related to Our Brewery and Micro-brewing Operations." 

Our continuing operations are in the kombucha tea business. We acquired the b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha brand and the assets related to the production and sale of it on April 1, 2015. Our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha is a gluten free, organic certified, sparkling kombucha tea and is distributed in major health and grocery chains throughout North America. Our kombucha tea is brewed at our co-packaging facility located at 9 Minson Way, Montebello, CA 90640. Our headquarters are located at 3625 Del Amo Boulevard, Suite 385, Torrance, CA 90503 (888) 240-9197. We consider that our current principal office space arrangement is adequate and we will reassess our needs based upon our future growth. Our fiscal year end is December 31st.

Acquisition of Assets Related to the Kombucha Tea Business

On April 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of B&#38;R Liquid Adventure, LLC, a California Limited Liability Company ("B&#38;R") (the "Acquisition"). B&#38;R is engaged in the manufacture of b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha, a gluten free, organic certified, sparkling kombucha tea. On April 1, 2015, we executed all documents related to the Acquisition. Upon the closing of the Acquisition, we received substantially all of the operating assets of B&#38;R, consisting of inventory, fixed assets and intellectual property.

Kombucha, a fermented, probiotic tea beverage, offers a myriad of health benefits. With the acquisition of the b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha brand, which features eight flavors, we plan to leverage our beer-making expertise to expand distribution in major health and grocery chains throughout North America.

The purchase price of the operating assets of B&#38;R was a cash payment of $260,000, a secured promissory note in an amount of $140,000 and the issuance 1,479,290 shares of common stock valued at $500,000. In addition, we assumed $121,416 of scheduled liabilities. We accounted for the Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. B&#38;R's inventory, fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded based upon their estimated fair values as of the closing date of the Acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.

Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain indicators are present.

Discontinued Operations Related to Our Brewery and Micro-brewing Operations

On October 1, 2015, we executed all documents related to the sale of assets and various liabilities related to our brewery and micro-brewing operations to AMBREW (the "Sale"). Under the terms of the Sale, the assets consisted of inventory, fixed assets and intellectual property. The liabilities consisted of brewing-related contracts, liabilities related to inventory as well as lease obligations. The liabilities consisted of brewing-related contracts held by the Company, liabilities related to inventory as well as lease obligations. The Sale price was paid in cash of $395,650 and assumed debt owed to a third party related to three equipment financing agreements and various capital lease arrangements.

The Sale is subject to customary closing conditions, namely that the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board ("WSLCB") shall have approved AMBREW's assumption of the Company's WSLCB license and issued a corresponding license in AMBREW's name to operate the assets of the business from and after the Closing Date (the "WSLCB Condition"). The parties intend, to the maximum extent possible, provided that the conditions to Sale have occurred, including specifically the WSLCB Condition, that the benefits and obligations of ownership and operation of the assets of the business shall accrue to AMBREW beginning as of the Closing Date. As of April 5, 2016, the date these financial statements were available to be issued, the WSLCB has not issued a license to AMBREW.

We have recognized the sale of our brewery and micro-brewing operations as a discontinued operation as of September 30, 2015, in accordance with ASU 2014-08, "Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity," and provide the following supplemental information.

Our Products

Our revenue model is based on creating, selling and marketing b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha ready-to-drink beverages distributed and sold at retail outlets across all channels of distribution. Our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line consists of ten flavors including:

&#9679; 

Raspberry Pomegranate

&#9679; 

Blood Orange

&#9679; 

Grapefruit Sage

&#9679; Guava Mango 

&#9679; Lemongrass Ginger 

&#9679; Verbena Rose 

&#9679; Yuzu Lemon 

&#9679; Elderflower Green Tea 

&#9679; Tangerine/Ginger 

&#9679; Tropical Honey/Ginger. 

B&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha products are 100% organic, all natural, fermented black teas made with purified water, organic cane juice, and kombucha culture with origins in China tracing back more than 2,000 years. Kombucha products contain a colony of bacteria and yeast with more than 1 billion microorganisms. The product end result is rich in probiotics, B-Vitamins and other nutritional ingredients. Health benefits are mostly anecdotal but reputed to support digestion, detoxification, and boosting overall immunity.

We believe that the b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha flavor combinations and proprietary production process contribute to an industry leading flavor profile that meets core kombucha-user needs, but also has broad-based mainstream consumer appeal without the typical vinegar aftertaste associated with competitive kombucha products.

Product Quality and Consistency

The b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha products utilize a proprietary and unique production process that leads to product stability with a shelf life of nine months versus typically ninety days of competitors. In addition to a different production process, most competitors utilize small batch production processes and are handcrafted in nature. This leads to significant differences between batches and potential inconsistency in flavor and character every time. In contrast, we use large batch-controlled production processes. This statistically controlled approach, coupled with our proprietary production processes, leads to product stability, consistency, and safety with no risk of secondary fermentation and increased trace alcohol levels that can be an issue for many competitive kombucha products.

In addition to supply chain competitive advantages, our proprietary process also leads to a superior balanced flavor profile with a crisp clean finish and no harsh vinegar taste that is typically associated with competitive kombucha products. This more rounded and balanced complex flavor profile enables b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha to appeal to a more mainstream consumer without alienating hardcore kombucha advocates, which we believe helps retailers expand the category by adding our brand to their offerings.

Operations

We operate primarily as a sales, marketing and distribution company and believe that the b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha brand, the level of retail distribution and penetration across all channels, and our retail relationships will be our greatest determinants of market value over the long term. We currently utilize a hybrid production model whereby we purchase raw ingredients and packaging materials directly, and utilize the services of third-party manufacturers for production. Currently we utilize the services of one third-party manufacturer, Unix Packaging Inc. in Southern California. We then ship nationally from that location. From a logistics standpoint, this structure leads to increased distribution expense, thereby having a negative impact on our gross margins. In the future, we believe that we can expand our relationships into new geographies regions in order to lower supply chain and production costs, and thereby improving gross margins.

We estimate that our current production utilization at our existing manufacturer is less than 5% of their facility's overall capacity. We are engaged in a long-term, non-exclusive supply contract that concludes in December 2016, but that we can renew upon mutual agreement. We currently purchase our raw ingredients and packaging materials directly from our suppliers and then consolidate them. Our component raw materials and packaging materials are readily available through multiple vendors, with limited perceived risk to consistent supply. Anchor Glass Container Corporation is our principal packaging supplier, and California Custom Fruits and Flavors, Inc. is our primary ingredient supplier, along with multiple other secondary suppliers.

Sales and Distribution

Our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha brand is currently distributed into approximately 2,000 stores throughout the United States and Canada and mostly in the food, drug and mass market and specialty health food stores. To penetrate those channels and further expand national distribution, we have engaged sales agents, brokers, and regional and large national distributors to support our distribution expansion and retailer management efforts. We have also retained Horizon, UNFI, KeHE Distributors, R&#38;K Foods, Unified Grocers, DPI Specialty Foods and others as distributors. Currently, we sell all of our products to our retailers either direct or through brokers and distributors. Our larger retail clients purchase our product through their own warehouse distribution network. Our current retail clients include Whole Foods, Kroger, Safeway, Vons and Ralphs and multiple smaller independent food, drug and mass market and specialty health food stores.

We expect to continue to expand our national distribution and retailer network into more food, drug and mass market and specialty health food stores. Like most competitors in ready-to-drink healthy beverages, we expect to compete in all channels including food, drug, mass, convenience, gas, specialty health food, club, and other stores.

In order to continue our expansion, we anticipate that we will be required to invest in marketing and advertising to ensure consumer purchases and retailer sell-through off the shelf. We expect to continue to offer promotional allowances, trial and sampling programs, and other initiatives to support our retailers. These marketing investments range from 5% to 15% of net sales, and are similar to most other beverage company promotional programs. Many retailers request some type of promotional introductory program, slotting fees or other incentives, which can be as much as 10% of net sales. Thus far, we have been successful in mitigating or even eliminating these introductory fees and have been able to offset them with additional goods, marketing activities, and other support programs.

Market Opportunity

According to the Euromonitor and the Wall Street Journal, the kombucha category has been rapidly growing at more than 40% per year compounded annually for the last five years and reached $529 million in retail sales in the United States for 2015. It is a global business with the United States accounting for an estimated 39.4% of the global market. The kombucha segment is growing rapidly along with the overall healthy, functional beverage segment, as the products source volume from traditional soft drinks, juices, sweet teas and other beverages high in sugar content.

&#160;

- 8 -

The kombucha category in the United States is also highly fragmented with numerous small competitors. We believe only one major competitor has more than 80% share of the kombucha category. The main competitors are currently in significantly broader distribution than b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha and have gained a head start with retailers and consumers in developing their brands.

Plan of Operations

We believe we have established the processes, systems, and infrastructure to enable us to expand. In order for us to implement our business plan and further our growth and profitability over the next twelve-month period, we have identified the following milestones that we expect to achieve:

&#183; Expand Retail Distribution and Channel Penetration. We are in negotiations or have received new item paperwork to introduce our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line to approximately 600 additional retailers located throughout North America. We believe that by December 31, 2016, we will be distributed in over 4,000 stores. 

&#183; Increase Manufacturing Capacity. To meet greater demand, we expect to expand our manufacturing which could include expansion with existing and new co-packers that are strategically located to reduce freight costs, improve cost of goods sold and efficiency and meet future growth objectives. 

&#183; Improve Gross Margins. We currently produce our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line via a third-party manufacturer in one location in Southern California. Our glass bottles, raw ingredients and other materials are also shipped from the Midwest and other locations. Finished goods are produced and shipped nationally from the manufacturing location. This model is suboptimal, and although it may be the same model as the other kombucha manufacturers in the industry, we believe that there are significant opportunities to improve gross margins by reducing supply chain expenses. 

&#183; Expand the Distributor and Broker Network. We expect to continue to develop our working relationships with our broker and distributor network. We continually meet, train, and participate in sales calls with our brokers in order to provide them with the sales tools they need to help their efforts to sell our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line. In the future, we anticipate a considerable amount of travel and ongoing support for both internal staff and outside brokers. 

&#183; Strengthen our Infrastructure and Organization. In order to support expansion efforts and to continue the training and support of our broker network, we will need to hire approximately 2-3 more full-time employees for the specific purpose of supporting the broker, distributor and retailers and their logistical requirements. 

&#183; Begin Marketing and Promotion. As distribution expands, we expect to be able to provide additional focus on building our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line. These activities will be primarily concentrated on awareness and trial to enable our brand to become more of a part of the consideration set of consumers within their repertoire of current kombucha and other healthy beverage choices. 

- 9 -

We believe that our cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through 2016. We will need to raise additional cash, either through the sale of equity or debt securities, to meet our planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the next 12 months. We estimate that our capital needs over the next 12 months will be $400,000 to $500,000. We will require additional cash resources to achieve the milestones indicated above. If our own financial resources and future current cash flows from operations are insufficient to satisfy our capital requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness will result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that could restrict our operations or modify our plans to grow the business. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, will limit our ability to expand our business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.

Dependence on Few Customers

Receivables arising from sales of our products are not collateralized. As of December 31, 2015 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 92.8% (59.0%, 22.9% and 10.9%) of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2014 (Predecessor), four customers represented approximately 75.1% (25.4%, 24.0%, 13.5% and 12.1%) of accounts receivable.

For the nine months ended December 31, 2015 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 75.6% (32.7%, 24.2% and 26.0%) of total revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 (Predecessor), three customers represented approximately 85.6% (30.2%, 29.4% and 26.0%) of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014 (Predecessor), four customers represented approximately 84.5% (28.1%, 18.9%, 18.9% and 18.6%) of revenue.

There can be no assurance that such customers will continue to order our products in the same level or at all. A reduction or delay in orders from such customers, including reductions or delays due to market, economic or competitive conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Marketing

We intend to market our product with a range of consumer and trade focused activities that include, but are not limited to, digital marketing and social media, retailer quarterly price promotions, co-op ads, regional press, consumer-facing public relations, experiential and event marketing and activation, consumer promotions and trial and sampling activities.

Competition

The beverage industry is extremely competitive. The principal areas of competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors, and marketing campaigns. Our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line will be competing directly with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other marketing campaigns. In addition, companies manufacturing these products generally have far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we have.

Important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include the continued public perception of the benefits of kombucha, taste and flavor of our product, trade and consumer promotions, the development of new, unique and cutting edge products, attractive and unique packaging, branded product advertising, pricing, and the success of our distribution network.

- 10 -

We will also be competing to secure distributors who will agree to distribute our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line over those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution, and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. The extremely competitive pressures within the beverage categories could result in our product never even being introduced beyond what they can market locally themselves.

Our product will compete generally with all liquid refreshments, including other specialty functional beverages, such as Synergy, Kevita, Health-Ade, Reed's, Kombucha Wonder Drink, and others.

Products offered by our direct competitors are sold in various volumes and prices with prices ranging from approximately $3.29 to $4.99 for similar-sized bottles. We currently offer our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha products in a 16-ounce bottle for a manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) of $3.19 - $3.49.

Intellectual Property

Where available, we intend to obtain trademark protection in the United States for a number of trademarks for slogans and product designs. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights. The trademark for b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha has been approved and is currently active.

In addition to trademark protection, the manufacture of our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line utilizes a proprietary production process unique in the industry that leads to elimination of the lingering and offensive vinegary aftertaste associated with many competitive kombucha products. In addition to flavor profile, we believe our production process also leads to the most consistent quality product in the industry that leads to product stability with a shelf life of nine months versus a maximum of ninety days of competitors.

While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result in a substantial costs and diversion of efforts, we believe that the protection of our intellectual property rights will be a key component of our sales and operating strategy.

Seasonality of Business

The sales of our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. We believe that this is indicative of the seasonality associated with ready-to-drink cold beverages in general. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our product and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.

Government Regulation

The advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha product line will be subject to: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations.

Legal requirements apply in many jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing, and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at the local, state and federal levels in the United States.

Any third-party bottling facility that we may choose to utilize in the future and any other such operations will be subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater. It will be our policy to comply with any and all such legal requirements. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.

Kombucha is a fermented tea product. With that fermentation, a trace amount of alcohol is produced, typically less than 0.5%. This trace alcohol amount allows the products to be commercialized as non-alcoholic beverages. The fact that there are trace amounts of alcohol led to consumer confusion in 2011 and 2012, which led to product recalls from various retailers. Although the manufacture of our b&#250;cha&#174; Live Kombucha products utilizes strict quality control processes in its production processes to keep its products at trace levels, not all kombucha products in the industry are manufactured under the same standards. In addition, other competitors, due to their different production processes, may experience secondary fermentation in their bottles, especially as their products age, which can lead to an increase in alcohol levels above the legal trace limits. Our manufacturing process precludes the risk of secondary fermentation, contributes to bottles not exploding upon opening, and leads to the longer shelf life, consistency and product quality.

Employees

We currently employ eight full time employees and four part-time employees in marketing, accounting, legal and administration. We work with distributors and retail brokers in the United States who are paid on a contract basis. Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of production, operations, corporate administration and business development. We intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. Our management's relationships with manufacturers, development/research companies, bottling concerns, and certain retail customers will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future. We believe that the skill-set of our management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and distribution expansion, and retailer relationships.
