 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

We were incorporated April 24, 2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are a controlled subsidiary of Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc, a Delaware corporation. We intend to engage primarily in the development of regenerative medical applications which we intend to license from other entities up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. The primary factor to be considered by us in arriving at a decision to advance an application further to Phase III clinical trials would be a greater than anticipated indication of efficacy seen in Phase I trials. 

&#160; 

As of December 13, 2015 , we have not licensed any existing therapies which may be marketed. On June 23, 2015 Regen Biopharma, Inc. ( &#8220;Regen&#8221;) entered into an agreement (&#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Zander Therapeutics, Inc. ( &#8220;Zander&#8221;) whereby Regen granted to Zander an exclusive worldwide right and license for the development and commercialization of certain intellectual property controlled by Regen (&#8220; License IP&#8221;) for non-human veterinary therapeutic use for a term of fifteen years. Zander is a wholly owned subsidiary of Entest Biomedical, Inc. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen one-time, non-refundable, upfront payment of one hundred thousand US dollars ($100,000) as a license initiation fee which must be paid within 90 days of June 23, 2015 and an annual non-refundable payment of one hundred thousand US dollars ($100,000) on on July 15th, 2016 and each subsequent anniversary of the effective date of the Agreement. 

The abovementioned payments may be made, at Zander&#8217;s discretion, in cash or newly issued common stock of Zander or in common stock of Entest BioMedical Inc. valued as of the lowest closing price on the principal exchange upon which said common stock trades publicly within the 14 trading days prior to issuance. 

Pursuant to the Agreement, Zander shall pay to Regen royalties equal to four percent (4%) of the Net Sales , as such term is defined in the Agreement, of any Licensed Products, as such term is defined in the Agreement, in a Quarter. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Agreement, Zander will pay Regen ten percent (10%) of all consideration (in the case of in-kind consideration, at fair market value as monetary consideration) received by Zander from sublicensees ( excluding royalties from sublicensees based on Net Sales of any Licensed Products for which Regen receives payment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement). 

&#160; 

Zander is obligated pay to Regen minimum annual royalties of ten thousand US dollars ($10,000) payable per year on each anniversary of the Effective Date of this Agreement, commencing on the second anniversary of June 23, 2015. This minimum annual royalty is only payable to the extent that royalty payments made during the preceding 12-month period do not exceed ten thousand US dollars ($10,000). 

&#160; 

The Agreement may be terminated by Regen: 

&#160; 

If Zander has not sold any Licensed Product by ten years of the effective date of the Agreement or Zander has not sold any Licensed Product for any twelve (12) month period after Zander&#8217;s first commercial sale of a Licensed Product. 

&#160; 

The Agreement may be terminated by Zander with regard to any of the License IP if by five years from the date of execution of the Agreement a patent has not been granted by the United States patent and Trademark Office to Regen with regard to that License IP. 

&#160; 

The Agreement may be terminated by Zander with regard to any of the License IP if a patent that has been granted by the United States patent and Trademark Office to Regen with regard to that License IP is terminated. 

&#160; 

The Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party. 

&#160; 

David R. Koos serves as sole officer and director of both Zander and Entest Biomedical, Inc. and also serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Regen. 

&#160; 

Zander will be required to obtain approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) in order to market any Licensed Product which may be developed within the United States and no assurance may be given that such approval would be granted.

On November 9, 2016 the Company formed Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

&#160; 

Principal Products and Services 

&#160; 

HemaXellarate I 

&#160; 

The Company has begun development of HemaXellerate I, a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellerate I is a patient-specific composition of cells that have been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells based on previous animal studies. The initial application of HemaXellerate I will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia which is characterized by immune-mediated bone marrow hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue) and pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells and platelets). 

&#160; 

Adipose tissue is collected from the patient and processed in order to separate, extract and isolate Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF), a mix of various cell types including mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells. Mesenchymal stem cells are connective tissue cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types and endothelial cells are the cells that line the interior surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels and which play a vital role in angiogenesis ( the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels). 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The isolated SVF is then intravenously administered to the patient. The Company believes that the isolated SVF will generate growth factors with the ability to repair damaged hematopoietic stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are immature cells that can develop into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow. 

&#160; 

On February 5, 2013 Regen filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) to initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate I I in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous SVF cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse. 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a previously unapproved drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven year period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for that time period. The sponsor of the product would also be entitled to a United States federal tax credit equal to 50% of clinical investigation expenses as well as exemptions from certain fees. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that this application of HemaXellerate I qualifies for Orphan designation under the Orphan Drug Act due to the fact that aplastic anemia is a rare disease with prevalence in the United States of less than 200,000 and intends to apply to the FDA for Orphan designation for HemaXellerate. 

&#160; 

On December 10, 2015 Regen was informed by the United States Food and Drug Administration that Regen has satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues related to Regen&#8217;s Investigational New Drug Application for HemaXellerate I and may initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse. 

&#160; 

HemaXellerate II 

&#160; 

Also in early stage development by the Company is a version of HemaXellerate called HemaXellerate II. 

&#160; 

HemaXellerate II is intended to be a universal donor endothelial cell based therapeutic and is intended to be manufactured by obtaining cells from a part of the placenta called the &#8220;vascular lobules&#8221;. The cells are processed and utilized for the purpose of stimulating bone marrow hematopoetic stem cell repair and proliferation. The mechanism of action for HemaXellerate II is similar to HemaXellerate I whereby the harvested and processed cells would produce growth factors which would mediate the therapeutic effects of the product. The Company has not begun preclinical development of HemaXellerate II as of December 29, 2015. 

&#160; 

The therapeutic concept behind the HemaXellerate products derives from intellectual property licensed to the Company by Oregon Health&#38; Science University (US patent No. 6,821,513 &#8220;Method for enhancing hematopoiesis&#8221; issued Nov. 23, 2004) pursuant to an agreement entered into by the parties on June 5, 2013. This agreement was terminated by mutual consent on August 8, 2013 due to the fact that US patent No. 6,821,513 had expired due to nonpayment of the required maintenance fees by Oregon Health &#38; Science University. The Company has been informed by its counsel and believes that the expiration of US patent No. 6,821,513 signifies that no party can be sued for future infringement based on the patent. Thus the Company is free to practice the claimed methods recited in the expired patent in the future without being liable for patent infringement based on the patent.

&#160;

&#160; 

dCell Vax &#160; 

&#160; 

dCellVax is intended to be a therapy whereby dendritic cells of the cancer patient are harvested from the body , treated with plasmid DNA that has the ability to block the dendritic cell from expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (&#8220;IDO&#8221;) and subsequently reimplanted in the cancer patient. 

&#160; 

The dendritic cells that are treated with the IDO-blocking plasmid become resistant to the influence of tumor cells which produce factors which cause the dendritic cell to express the IDO. Expression of IDO on the dendritic cell halts the dendritic cell from activating T cells and causes the dendritic cell to suppress T cells. T lymphocytes (&#8216;T cells&#8221;) are a lymphocyte that play a central role in the human immune system&#8217;s attempt to eradicate tumors. The Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety with signals of efficacy of the dCellVax gene silenced dendritic cell immunotherapy for treating breast cancer. The proposed trial will recruit 10 patients with metastatic breast cancer and will involve 4 monthly injections of the dCellVax gene-silenced dendritic cell therapy. The trial is anticipated to l last one year, with tumor assessment before therapy and at 6 and 12 months. 

&#160; 

The concepts utilized in formulating dCellVax are derived 

&#160; 

(a) &#160; from patented intellectual property acquitted by the Company from Dr. Wei Ping Min which is method directed to the silencing of immunosuppressive cancer causing genes using short interfering RNA (siRNA) and which has been granted patent protection under US Patent # 8,389,708 

(b) &#160; from patented intellectual property licensed to the Company by Benitec. &#160; 

NR2F6 

&#160; 

Regen has been assigned intellectual property with regard to the gene NR2F6 . It is believed by the Company that NR2F6 expression leads to the shutting down of the immune system&#8217;s natural ability to kill cancerous cells. The Company believes that identification of a small molecule which could inhibit this receptor would potentially provide an avenue for immunotherapy of cancer. 

&#160; 

Tcellvax 

Tcellvax is intended to be an autologous cellular product comprised of NR2F6 gene-silenced peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It has been demonstrated that mice genetically deficient for NR2F6 are capable of immunologically rejecting tumors. The Company has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) to initiate a clinical trial .The proposed clinical trial would be a single center, open label, non-randomized Phase I/II trial to test the safety and efficacy of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells that have been gene-silenced for NR2F6 using short interfering RNA (siRNA) 

&#160; 

Small Molecules 

The Company is also actively identifying small molecules via a high throughput screening program that inhibit NR2F6 leading to immune cell activation for oncology applications. 

&#160; 

On December 15, 2015 Regen entered into an agreement (&#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (&#8220;NCATS&#8221;), which is a component of the National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services whereby Regen and NCATS shall collaborate to screen for small molecule compounds that activate or inhibit the orphan nuclear receptor, NR2F6. 

&#160; 

Regen will be required to obtain approval from the FDA in order to market any of Regen&#8217;s products or therapies. No approval has been granted by the FDA for the marketing and sale of any of the Company&#8217;s products and therapies and no assurance may be given that any of the Company&#8217;s products or therapies will be granted such approval. The Company&#8217;s current plans include the development of regenerative medical applications up to the point of successful completion of Phase I and/ or Phase II clinical trials after which we would either attempt to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. We can provide no assurance that the Company will be able to sell or license any product or that, if such product is sold or licensed, such sale or license will be on terms favorable to the Company. 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

Distribution methods of the products or services: 

It is anticipated that Regen will enter into licensing and/or sublicensing agreements with outside entities in order that Regen may obtain royalty income on the products and services which it may develop and commercialize. 

&#160; 

Competitive business conditions and Regen's competitive position in the industry and methods of competition

Need for any government approval of principal products or services, effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business. 

&#160; 

The US Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs or biologics, , depending upon such factors as the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition, and the interaction of the product on the human body. In the United States, products that are intended to be introduced into the body will generally be regulated as drugs, while tissues and cells intended for transplant into the human body will be generally be regulated as biologics. 

&#160; 

Our domestic human drug and biological products will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals, an Investigational New Drug Application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) must be filed with the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. 

&#160; 

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Phase I 

&#160; 

Phase 1 trials are designed to assess the safety (pharmacovigilance), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of a drug. These trials are often conducted in an inpatient clinic, where the subject can be observed by full-time staff. The subject who receives the drug is usually observed until several half-lives of the drug have passed. Phase I trials normally include dose-ranging, also called dose escalation, studies so that the appropriate dose for therapeutic use can be found. The tested range of doses usually are a fraction of the dose that causes harm in animal testing and involve a small group of healthy volunteers. However, there are some circumstances when real patients are used, such as patients who have end-stage disease and lack other treatment options. 

&#160; 

Phase II 

&#160; 

Phase II trials are designed to assess how well the drug or biologic works, as well as to continue Phase I safety assessments in a larger group of volunteers and patients. Phase II trials are performed on larger groups. 

&#160; 

Phase III 

&#160; 

Phase III trials are aimed at being the definitive assessment of how effective the product is in comparison with current best standard treatment and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III trials may also be conducted for the purposes of (i) &#34;label expansion&#34; (to show the product works for additional types of patients/diseases beyond the original use for which the drug was approved for marketing or (ii) to obtain additional safety data, or to support marketing claims for the product. 

&#160; 

On occasion Phase IV (Post Approval) trials may be required by the FDA. Phase IV trials involve the safety surveillance (pharmacovigilance) and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives permission to be sold.The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during the Phase I-III clinical trials. 

&#160; 

All phases, must be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product. No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) or Biologic License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) or has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to NDA or BLA approval. 

&#160; 

Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. In addition, use of these products during testing and after marketing could reveal side effects that could delay, impede, or prevent FDA marketing approval, resulting in FDA-ordered product recall, or in FDA-imposed limitations on permissible 

&#160; 

The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) . The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical products. Generally, claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of an NDA or an amendment to an NDA, and statements regarding the use of a product must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product. 

&#160; 

Sales of drugs and biologics outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

Regen has filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to initiate clinical trials assessing the company&#8217;s HemaXellerate I drug currently in development in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. Regen has also filed an IND to initiate a Phase I/II clinical trial assessing safety with signals of efficacy of the dCellVax gene silenced dendritic cell immunotherapy for treating breast cancer. The clinical trials for which the INDs were submitted may not commence until approval to commence such trials has been granted to Regen by the FDA. On December 10, 2015 the Company was informed by the United States Food and Drug Administration that Regen has satisfactorily addressed all clinical hold issues related to Regen&#8217;s Investigational New Drug Application for HemaXellerate and may initiate a Phase I clinical trial assessing HemaXellerate I in patients with drug-refractory aplastic anemia. The Phase I clinical trial is intended to determine safety and potential efficacy of intravenously administered autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells in patients with severe, immune suppressive refractory aplastic anemia with the primary endpoints of safety and feasibility and secondary endpoints of efficacy as determined by patients having complete response, partial response or relapse.
