 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a provider of professional technical and consulting services to utilities, private industry, and public agencies at all levels of government. Nationwide, we enable our clients to realize cost and energy savings by providing a wide range of specialized services . We assist our clients with a broad range of complementary services relating to: 

&#183; 

Energy Efficiency and Sustainability; 

&#183; 

Engineering and Planning; 

&#183; 

Economic and Financial Consulting; and 

&#183; 

National Preparedness and Interoperability. 

We operate our business through a network of offices located primarily in California and New York. We also have operations in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Oregon, Texas, Washington and Washington, DC. As of January 1, 2016 , we had a staff of &#160; 688 , which includes licensed engineers and other professionals. 

We seek to establish close working relationships with our clients and expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them over time . &#160; Our business with public and private utilities is concentrated primaril y in California and New York, but w e also have business with utilities in Texas, Illinois, Ohio and Washington State. We currently serve 17 major utility customers across the country. O ur business with public agencies is concentrated in California and Arizona. We provide services to many of the cities and counties in California. We also serve special districts, school districts, a range of public agencies and private industry. 

We were founded in 1964 and Willdan Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2006 to serve as our holding company. Historically, our clients have been public agencies in communities with populations ranging from 10,000 to 300,000 people. We believe communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies that tend to focus on securing large federal and state projects, and projects for the private sector. We consist of a family of wholly &#8209;owned companies that operate within the following segments for financial reporting purposes: 

Energy Efficiency Services. Our Energy Efficiency Services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary, Willdan Energy Solutions, which offers energy efficiency and sustainability consulting services to utilities, public agencies and private industry. This segment is currently our largest segment based on contract revenue, representing approximately 55% and 49% of our consolidated contract rev enue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

Engineering Services. Our Engineering Services segment includes the operations of our subsidiaries, Willdan Engineering, Willdan Infrastructure and Public Agency Resources (&#8220;PARs&#8221;). Willdan Engineering provides civil engineering &#8209;related and city planning services, geotechnical and other engineering consulting services to our clients. Willdan Infrastructure, which was launched in fiscal year 2013, provides engineering services to larger rail, port, water, mining and other civil engineering projects. PARs primarily provides staffing to Willdan Engineering. Contract revenue for the Engineering Services segment represented approximately 34% and 38% of our overall consolidated contract rev enue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

Public Finance Services. Our Public Finance Services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary, Willdan Financial Services, which offers economic and financial consulting services to public agencies. Contract revenue for the Public Finance Services segment represented approximately 9% and 10% of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

Homeland Security Services. Our Homeland Security Services segment consists of the business of our subsidiary, Willdan Homeland Solutions, which offers national preparedness and interoperability services and 

&#160;

communications and technology solutions. Contract revenue for our Homeland Security Services segment re presented approximately 2% and 3% of our consolidated contract revenue for fiscal years 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

Our Markets 

We provide energy efficiency, engineering and planning, economic and financial consulting and national preparedness and interoperability services primarily to public agencies and utilities, as well as private utilities and firms. We believe the market for these privatized governmental services is, and will be, driven by a number of factors, including: 

&#183; 

Increased demand for services and solutions that provide energy efficiency, sustainability, water conservation and renewable energy in the public and private sectors; 

&#183; 

Population growth, which leads to a need for increased capacity in government services and infrastructure; 

&#183; 

The creation of new municipalities and the growth of smaller communities, which creates the need to obtain highly specialized services without incurring the costs of hiring permanent staffing and the associated support structure; 

&#183; 

Demand by constituents for a wider variety of services; 

&#183; 

The deterioration of local infrastructures, especially in aging areas; and 

&#183; 

Government funding programs, such as federal homeland security grants and various state legislation, that provide funds for local communities to provide services to their constituents. 

Energy Efficiency and Sustainability Services 

In response to an increased awareness of global warming and climate change issues, private industry and public agencies are increasingly s eeking out cost &#8209;effective, turn key solutions that provide innovative energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation and sustainability services. State and local governments are frequently turning to specialized resource conservation firms to strike the balance between environmental responsibility and economic competitiveness. Consultants have the expertise to develop efficient and cost effective solutions. The use of energy efficiency services, including audits, program design, benchmark analysis, metering and partnerships provides government agencies, utilities and private firms with the ability to realize long &#8209;term savings. 

Engineering and Planning Services 

Engineering and planning services encompass a variety of disciplines associated with the design and construction of public infrastructure improvements. We expect continued population growth in California and other western states to place a significant strain on the infrastructure in those areas, driving the need for both new infrastructure and the rehabilitation of aging structures. Federal, state and local governments have responded to this need by proposing an increase in their funding of infrastructure related activit ies. &#160; 

Economic and Financial Consulting 

Public agencies must raise the necessary funding to build, improve and maintain infrastructure and to provide services to their local communities. While tax revenue is the primary source of public agency funding, certain states, including California, impose property tax and spending limits that curtail the generation of such funds. Alternatives include the issuance of tax &#8209;exempt securities; the formation of special financing districts to assess property owners on a parcel basis for infrastructure and public improvements, such as assessment districts and community facilities districts (known as Mello &#8209;Roos districts in California); the implementation of development impact fee programs that require developers to bear the cost of the impact of development on local infrastructure; user fee programs that pass costs along to the actual users of services; optimization of utility rates; and special taxes enacted by voters for specific purposes. 

&#160;

Public agencies frequently contract with private consultants to provide advance studies, manage the processes and provide the administration necessary to support these methods. Consultants have the expertise necessary to form the special financing districts and produce an impact fee study used to develop a schedule of developer fees. Privatized services are also utilized to implement the programs or revised rate schedules, and in the case of special financing districts, administer the districts through the life of the bonds. Consultants also frequently provide the services necessary to comply with federal requirements for tax &#8209;exempt debt, such as arbitrage rebate calculations and continuing disclosure reports. Use of such services allows public agencies to capitalize on innovative public finance techniques without incurring the cost of developing in &#8209;house expertise. 

Homeland Security, National Preparedness and Interoperability Services 

After September 11, 2001, the need to protect civil infrastructure and implement additional security measures became a priority at all levels of government. In addition to the threat of terrorism, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Superstorm Sandy highlighted the vulnerability of our country&#8217;s infrastructure to natural disasters, and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill along the Louisiana Gulf Coast emphasized the need for disaster preparedness. Such events place an increased burden on local and regional public agencies to be prepared to respond. In addition to fire and safety personnel, agencies responsible for the physical safety of infrastructure elements, such as water and wastewater systems, ports and airports, roads and highways, bridges and dams, are under increased pressure to prepare for natural and man &#8209;made disasters. Accordingly, the federal government now considers public works staff members to be &#8220;first responders&#8221; to such incidents and we believe that agencies are allocating resources accordingly. 

Our Services 

We specialize in providing professional technical and consulting services to utilities, private industry and public agencies at all levels of government. Our core client base is composed of public and private utilities, commercial and industrial firms, cities, counties, special districts, other local and state agencies and tribal governments. 

We are organized to profitably manage numerous small to mid &#8209;size contracts at the same time. Our contracts can range from $1,000 to over $5,000,000 in contract revenue. Our contracts typically have a duration of between two and thirty-six months , although we have city services contracts that have been in effect for over 30 years. At January 1 , 201 6 , we had approximately 1, 977 &#160; open projects. 

We offer services in four segments: Energy Efficiency Services, Engineering Services, Public Finance Services, and Homeland Security Services. The interfaces and synergies among these segments are key elements of our strategy. Management established these segments based upon the services provided, the different marketing strategies associated with these services and the specialized needs of their respective clients. The following table presents, for the years indicated, the approximate percentage of our consolidated contract revenue attributable to each segment:

Public Finance Services 

Since 1999, our subsidiary Willdan Financial Services, a public finance consulting business, has supplement ed the engineering services that we offer our clients. In general, we supply expertise and support for the various financing techniques employed by public agencies to finance their operations and infrastructure. We also support the mandated reporting and other requirements associated with these financings. We do not provide underwriting or financial advisory services for municipal securities. 

Unlike our Engineering Services business, we often compete for business, at least initially, through a competitive bid process. Agencies competitively bid out services on a regular basis. The new contract terms are generally one, three or five years per contract. 

Our services in this segment include the following: 

District Administration. We administer special districts on behalf of public agencies. The types of special districts administered include community facilities districts (in California, Mello &#8209;Roos districts), assessment districts, landscape and lighting districts, school facilities improvement districts, benefit assessment districts, fire suppression districts, and business improvement districts. Our administration services include calculating the annual levy for each parcel in the district; billing charges directly or through a county tax roll; preparing the annual Engineer&#8217;s Report, budget and resolutions; reporting on collections and payment status; calculating prepayment quotes; and providing financial analyses, modeling and budget forecasting. 

The key to our District Administration services is our proprietary software package, MuniMagic SM : Municipal Administration &#38; Government Information Coordinator, which we developed internally to redefine the way we administer special districts. MuniMagic is a database management program that maintains parcel data; calculates special taxes, assessments, fees and charges; manages payment tracking; maintains bond &#8209;related information in a single, central location; and provides reporting, financial modeling and analysis at multiple levels of detail. MuniMagic offers a significant competitive advantage in an industry driven by the ability to accurately process large quantities of data. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Other special projects, including facility financing plans, formation of new public entities, annexations and incorporations; reassessment engineering and financial analysis for bond offerings or refundings; development and financial projections; and nexus studies between public and private enterprises, including public &#8209;private partnerships and the benefits of economic development to municipalities and to state, provincial, regional and national governments. 

Federal Compliance. We offer federal compliance services to issuers of municipal securities, which can be cities, towns, school districts, housing authorities, and other entities that are eligible to issue tax &#8209;exempt securities. Specifically, we provide arbitrage rebate calculations and municipal disclosure services that help issuers remain in compliance with federal regulations. We provide these reports, together with related compliance services such as bond elections, temporary period yield restriction, escrow fund monitoring, rebate payments, and refund requests. In terms of continuing disclosure services, we both produce the required annual reports and disseminate those reports on behalf of the issuers. We provide federal compliance services to approximately 750 issuers in 42 states and the District of Columbia on more than 2,500 bond issues totaling over $60 billion in municipal debt . 

Representative Projects. Examples of typical projects we have in the Public Finance Services segment include: 

&#183; 

City of Miramar, Florida, Economic Development Action Plan. We were hired by the City of Miramar to prepare an Economic Development Action Plan. The objective of this project is to assist the City and community stakeholders in guiding the strategies and goals executed by the Economic Development Department over the next three to ten years. The final deliverables will provide the City with research, analysis, economic benchmarking, and an implementation plan which includes monitoring and reporting tools based on industry methodologies, structured for easy use by City staff. These deliverables will be used to implement the study&#8217;s priorities and recommendations after the contract period.

City of Plano, Texas, Rate Methodology Assessment. We were retained by the City of Plano, Texas, and other member cities of the North Texas Municipal Water District, to complete an assessment of the rate 

&#160;

methodology used to charge member and customer cities. The District consists of 13 member cities and 33 customer cities from the North Dallas area, serving 1.6 million consumers. The project consists of evaluating the current rate methodology and recommending alternatives to more equitably allocate costs amongst member cities and to customer cities. In order to achieve this objective, and have a platform to best communicate results, we developed an interactive model to simulate changes in rate methodology . 

Homeland Security Services 

In fiscal year 2004, we formed our subsidiary Willdan Homeland Solutions (&#8220;WHS&#8221;), formerly known as American Homeland Solutions. WHS provides emergency preparedness planning, emergency preparedness training, emergency preparedness exercises, communications and technology, and water security services that focus on integrating local resources and assets within state and federal systems to cities, counties and related municipal service agencies, such as utility and water companies, as well as school districts, port and transportation authorities, tribal governments and large business enterprises with a need for homeland security related services. We staff our projects in this area with former high &#8209;level local and regional public safety officers and focus on solutions tailored for local agencies and their personnel. Our services include the following: 

Emergency Preparedness Planning. We design, develop, implement, review, and evaluate public and private agencies&#8217; emergency operations and hazard mitigation plans, including compliance and consistency with federal, state and local laws and policies. Plans are tailored to respond to terrorism, intentional acts of sabotage, and natural disasters. We also provide command and control and emergency response training for all types of unusual occurrences. We have developed emergency operations, hazard mitigation, continuity of operations and business continuity and recovery plans for municipal governments, special districts, school districts, and private &#8209;industry clients. 

Emergency Preparedness Training. We design customized training courses for all aspects of disaster, unusual occurrence and emergency responses. In this regard, we have developed and own several training courses that meet or exceed the requirements for the federal National Incident Management System (&#8220;NIMS&#8221;) training. These courses assist clients in meeting their obligations to prepare their staff to utilize the NIMS. 

Emergency Preparedness Exercises. We conduct planning sessions and exercises, including those relating to weapons of mass destruction, large events, mass casualty transportation disasters, terrorism incident response, natural disaster response and recovery, and civil disorder events. We design these exercises for multi &#8209;agency involvement so they are fully compliant with the federal government&#8217;s Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program, the State Emergency Management System for California, and the National Response Framework. Exercises are designed to evaluate and test &#8220;first responders&#8221; and support personnel, as well as elected officials and agency management. 

Communications and Technology. We provide homeland security, public safety, and emergency response capabilities for government and corporate clients that focus on integrating local resources and assets within federal, state, and local systems. Core competencies include requirements development, integration, life cycle analysis, system design, procurement and selection, deployment, interoperability, project management, quality management, assessments, conceptual and final design and gap analysis in the public safety radio land mobile communications and corporate market including broadband networks, commercial cellular test plans, data networks, microwave network planning and related engineering design. 

Water Security. We offer NIMS and Incident Command System courses specific to water and wastewater agencies. Our instructors and course facilitators have significant experience in water and wastewater security, emergency preparedness, and business continuity. All courses are DHS &#8209;certified. Eligible agencies may use DHS Transit Security Grant Program funds for this approved training. The program is one in a number of comprehensive measures authorized by congress to directly support transportation infrastructure security activities. 

Representative Projects. Examples of typical Homeland Security Services projects include: 

&#183; 

National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak Security Exercise Program. The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, ( &#8220; Amtrak &#8221; ) selected us , as part of the project team under the direction of the principle contractor, Obsidian Analysis, Inc., to support their 2013-2015 security exercise program. For 

&#160;

this program, we established a corporate multi-year training and exercise program that included workshops, tabletops, drills, functional, and full-scale exercises. These exercises, along with the planning process, involved frontline employees and managers, such as conductors, road foremen, station, and onboard services personnel, management and corporate leadership, and integrated these groups with national and local partners and stakeholders, including local emergency response and management entities, transit agencies and other railroads, regulatory agencies, and private-sector partners . 

We provided key support to the program by facilitating all exercise events, engaging local agencies for participation, and developing and conducting exercises in Los Angeles and Oakland, California; Seattle, Washington; San Antonio, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana. We facilitated breakout discussion groups during the tabletop exercises that afforded Amtrak personnel with an opportunity to explore their roles and responsibilities during a variety of scenarios that included an active shooter incident, suspicious package in a station, and an improvised explosive device detonation aboard a moving train . 

&#183; 

County of Los Angeles, California, Department of Public Health &#8211; Medical Countermeasures (&#8220;MCM&#8221;) Exercise Series. The County of Los Angeles, Department of Public Health selected us to support the development and delivery of the November 2015 Los Angeles County Operational Area (&#8220;OA&#8221;), MCM Full-Scale Exercise (&#8220;FSE&#8221;). The FSE, conducted over a two-day period in November, 2015 , was designed to challenge all OA emergency management system participants in response to a simulated public health emergency. 

Specifically, we were tasked with developing and delivering a two-day FSE which exercised and assessed MCM Distribution (including the receipt, storage, and staging of MCMs from state and federal providers at the County designated Warehouse) and exercised and assessed the management and coordination of MCM Dispensing activities at county designated Points of Dispensing (&#8220;POD&#8221;) sites, which are established locations throughout Los Angeles County. 

We supported all aspects of FSE development and delivery, including the development of exercise player tools &#38; materials (including comprehensive communications plans and directories); development of a comprehensive, region-wide Master Scenario Events List, covering two-days of exercise play; the design and development of all exercise evaluation materials; specific guidance and tools for the various levels of exercise controllers, who had the responsibility to control exercise activities at a wide variety of exercise venues (such as POD Sites, Emergency Operations Centers, &#38; Incident Command Posts); and the facilitation and coordination of planning and exercise activity across the region. &#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

We provide a wide range of privatized services to the public sector, private firms and utilities. We have developed the experience base, professional staff and support technology and software necessary to quickly and effectively respond to the needs of our clients. We believe we have developed a reputation within our industry as problem solvers across a broad range of client issues. Some of our competitive strengths include: 

Quality of service. We pride ourselves on the quality of service that we provide to our clients. The work for which we compete is awarded primarily based on the company&#8217;s qualifications, rather than the fees proposed. We believe that our service levels, experience and expertise satisfy even the most rigorous qualification standards. We have developed a strong reputation for quality, based upon our depth of experience, ability to attract quality professionals, customized technology and software that support our services, local knowledge and the expertise we possess across multiple disciplines. We believe we are well &#8209;positioned to serve public sector clients due to our knowledge of the unique reporting processes and operating procedures of public agencies, which differ substantially from the private sector. We believe our high quality of service is a significant reason we currently provide services to approximately 85 % of the cities and approximately 91 % of the counties in California. 

Broad range of services. Our focus on customer service has led us to continually broaden the scope of the services we provide. At different stages in our history, as the needs of our clients have evolved, we have developed 

&#160;

service capabilities complementary to our core engineering business, including building and safety services, financial and economic services, planning services, geotechnical services, code enforcement services, disaster planning and homeland security services, and most recently, energy efficiency and sustainability. Further, because we recognize that local public sector projects and issues often cross departmental lines, we have developed the ability to deliver multiple services in a cohesive manner to better serve our client communities as a whole. 

Strategic locations in key markets. Local agencies want professionals who understand their local needs. Therefore, we deliver our services through a network of offices dispersed throughout the western United States, Kansas, Florida, Illinois , Washington, D.C., and New York. Each of our offices is staffed with quality professionals, including former management level public sector employees, such as planners, engineers, inspectors, and police and fire department personnel. These professionals understand the local and regional markets in which they work. 

Strong, long &#8209;term client relationships. We have developed strong relationships with our public agency clients, some of whom we have worked with for over 41 years. The value of these long &#8209;term relationships is reflected in the recurring award of new projects, ongoing staffing assignments, and long &#8209;term projects that require high &#8209;level supervision. We also seek to maintain close personal relationships with public agency decision &#8209;makers to strengthen our relationships with them and the agencies with which they work. We frequently develop new client relationships as our public agency contacts are promoted or move to other agencies. Our strong culture of community involvement and leadership in key public agency organizations underscores our customer focus and helps us cultivate and expand our client base. 

Experienced, talented and motivated employees. Our staff consists of seasoned professionals with a broad array of specialties, and a strong customer service orientation. Our corporate culture places a high priority on investing in our people, including providing opportunities for stock ownership to attract, motivate and retain top professionals. Our executive officers have an average of more than 37 years of experience in the engineering and consulting industry, and an average of 9 years with our company. 

Clients 

Our clients primarily consist of public and governmental agencies including cities, counties, redevelopment agencies, water districts, school districts and universities, state agencies, federal agencies, a variety of other special districts and agencies, tribal governments and public utilities. We also provide services to private utilities and private industry. Our primary clients are public agencies serving communities of 10,000 to 300,000 people and public and private utilities. In fiscal year 2015 , we served over 888 distinct clients. For fiscal year 2015 , we had two clients, the Consolidated Edison Company of New York and the City of Elk Grove that accounted for 25% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated contract revenue. None of our other clients accounted for over 10% of our consolidated contract revenue. Our clients are primarily based in California and New York, as well as Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Oregon, Texas, Washington and Washington, DC. In fiscal year 2015 , services provided to clients in California accounted for approximately 47% of our contract revenue and services provided to clients in New York accounted for approximately 28% of our contract revenue . 

Consolidated Edison SBDI Program. In July 2012, Willdan Energy Solutions entered into an Agreement for a Small Business Direct Install Program with Consolidated Edison Company of New York. The agreement continues our partnership with Consolidated Edison to develop Consolidated Edison&#8217;s Small Business Direct Install Program, which began in 2009. The initial term of this agreement extends through December 2016 . 

Contract Structure 

We provide our services under contracts, purchase orders or retainer letters. The contracts we enter into with our clients contain three principal types of pricing provisions: 

&#183; 

Time and materials provisions provide for reimbursement of costs and overhead plus a fee for labor based on the time expended on a project multiplied by a negotiated hourly billing rate. The profitability achievable on a time and materials basis is driven by billable headcount and cost control. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Unit based provisions require the delivery of specific units of work, such as arbitrage rebate calculations, dissemination of municipal securities continuing disclosure reports, or building plan checks, at an agreed price per unit, with the total payment under the contract determined by the actual number of units performed. 

&#183; 

Fixed price provisions require all work under a contract to be performed for a specified lump sum, which may be subject to adjustment if the scope of the project changes. Contracts with fixed price provisions carry certain inherent risks, including risks of losses from underestimating costs, delays in project completion, problems with new technologies, price increases for materials, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Consequently, the profitability, if any, of fixed price contracts can vary substantially. 

We also receive monthly retainers from a limited number of our clients. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the approximate percentage of our contract revenue subject to each type of pricing provision:

For time and materials and fixed price contracts, we bill our clients periodically in accordance with the contract terms based on costs incurred, on either an hourly fee basis or on a percentage of completion basis, as the project progresses. For unit based and retainer based contracts, we bill our clients upon delivery of the contracted item or service, and in some cases, in advance of delivery. 

Our contracts come up for renewal periodically and at the time of renewal may be subject to renegotiation, which could impact the profitability on that contract. In addition, during the term of a contract, public agencies may request additional or revised services which may impact the economics of the transaction. Most of our contracts permit our clients, with prior notice, to terminate the contracts at any time without cause. While we have a large volume of transactions and generally low customer concentration, the renewal, termination or modification of a contract may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operations. 

Competition 

The market for our services is highly fragmented. We often compete with many other firms ranging from small local firms to large national firms. Contract awards are based primarily on qualifications, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, geographic presence, stability and price. 

Doing business with governmental agencies is complex and requires the ability to comply with intricate regulations and satisfy periodic audits. We have been serving cities, counties, special districts and other public agencies for over 50 years. We believe that the ability to understand these requirements and to successfully conduct business with governmental entities and agencies is a barrier to entry for potential competitors. 

Our competition varies by type of client, type of service and geography. The range of competitors for any one project can vary depending upon technical specialties, the relative value of the project, geographic location, financial terms, risks associated with the work, and any client imposed restrictions. Unlike most of our competitors, we focus our services on public sector clients. Public sector clients generally choose among competing firms by weighing the quality, experience, innovation and timeliness of the firm&#8217;s services. When selecting consultants for engineering projects, many government agencies are required to, and others choose to, employ Qualifications Based Selection, or QBS. QBS requires the selection of the most technically qualified firms for a project, while the financial and legal terms of the engagement are generally secondary. QBS applies primarily to work done by our Engineering Services segment. 

&#160;

Contracts in our Energy Efficiency Services segment, the Public Finance Services and Homeland Security Services areas typically are not subject to mandatory QBS standards, and often are awarded through a competitive bid process. 

Our competition varies geographically. Although we provide services in several states, we may be stronger in certain service lines in some geographical areas than in other regions. Similarly, some of our larger competitors are stronger in some service lines in certain localities but are not as competitive in others. Our smaller competitors generally are limited both geographically as well as in the services they are able to provide. 

We believe that our Energy Efficiency Services segment competes primarily with Lockheed &#8209;Martin, EnerPath, KEMA (a division of the DNV Group) , Clear Result, Franklin Energy , ICF International, Inc., and Nexant, Inc. We believe that the primary competitors for our Engineering Services segment include Charles Abbott &#38; Associates , Inc., Harris &#38; Associates , RBF Consulting, Tetra Tech, Inc., Stantec, Inc., Michael Baker Corporation, TRC Companies, Inc., AECOM Technology Corporation, CH2M Hill and Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. Our chief competitors in our Public Finance Services segment include David Taussig &#38; Associates, Harris &#38; Associates, BLX Group, Arbitrage Compliance Specialists, Raftelis Financial Consultants, Inc., FCS Group and the NBS Government Finance Group. We believe the Homeland Security Services segment competes primarily with Leidos (formerly Science Applications International Corporation or SAIC ) and IEM, Inc. 

Insurance 

We currently maintain the following insurance coverage: commercial general liability with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million general aggregate; automobile liability insurance with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence; employer&#8217;s liability with limits of $1.0 million per occurrence. We also carry professional liability insurance with limits of $7.5 million per claim and $15 .0 million annual aggregate, excess liability insurance with a limit of $10.0 million, an umbrella/excess liability insurance of $25.0 million per occurrence and aggregate, and workers&#8217; compensation insurance of $1.0 million. We are liable to pay these claims from our assets if and when the aggregate settlement or judgment amount exceeds our policy limits . 

Employees 

At January 1, 2016 , we had approximately 490 full &#8209;time employees and 198 part &#8209;time employees. All Public Agency Resources&#8217; employees are classified as part &#8209;time. Our employees include, among others, licensed electrical, mechanical, structural and civil engineers , land surveyors, certified building officials, licensed geotechnical engineers and engineering geologists, certified inspectors and plans examiners, licensed architects and landscape architects, certified planners, and information technology specialists. We believe that we attract and retain highly skilled personnel with significant industry experience and strong client relationships by offering them challenging assignments in a stable work environment. We believe that our employee relations are good.
