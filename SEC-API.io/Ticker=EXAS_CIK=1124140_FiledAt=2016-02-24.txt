Overview 

Exact Sciences Corporation ( together with its subsidiaries, &#8220;Exact,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a molecular diagnostics company currently focused on the early detection and prevention of some of the deadliest forms of cancer . We have developed an accurate, non-invasive , patient friendly screening test called Cologuard&#174; , for the early detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer, and are currently working on the development of tests for lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and esophageal cancer. 

Our Cologuard Test 

&#160; 

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and the leading cause of cancer deaths among non-smokers. Each year there are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

137,000 new cases in the U.S. 

&#183; 

50,000 deaths in the U.S. 

&#183; 

1,200,000 new cases worldwide 

&#183; 

600,000 deaths worldwide 

&#160; 

Colorectal cancer treatment represents a significant growing healthcare cost. Annually, $14 billion is spent in the U.S. on colorectal cancer treatment and the projected annual treatment costs are expected to be $20 billion in 2020. The incidence of colorectal cancer in Medicare patients is expected to rise from 106,000 cases in 2010 to more than 180,000 cases in 2030. 

&#160; 

It is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. Colorectal cancer can take up to 10-15 years to progress from a pre-cancerous lesion to metastatic cancer and death. Patients who are diagnosed early in the progression of the disease&#8212;with pre-cancerous lesions or polyps, or early-stage cancer&#8212;are more likely to have a complete recovery and to be treated less expensively. Accordingly, the American Cancer Society ( &#8220; ACS &#8221; ) recommends that all people age 50 and older undergo regular colorectal cancer screening. Of the more than 80 million people in the U.S. for whom routine colorectal cancer screening is recommended, nearly 47 percent have not been screened according to current guidelines. Poor compliance with screening guidelines has meant that nearly two-thirds of colorectal cancer diagnoses are made in the disease&#8217;s late stages. The five-year survival rates for stages 3 and 4 are 67 percent and 12 percent, respectively. We believe the large underserved population of unscreened and inadequately screened patients represents a significant opportunity for a patient-friendly screening test. 

&#160; 

Our Cologuard test is a non-invasive stool-based DNA ( &#8220; sDNA &#8221; ) screening test designed to detect DNA markers, which in published studies have been shown to be associated with colorectal cancer. In addition to DNA markers, our test includes a protein marker to detect blood &#160; in the stool, utilizing an antibody-based fecal immunochemical test ( &#8220; FIT &#8221; ). 

&#160; 

On August 11, 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( &#8220; FDA &#8221; ) approved Cologuard for use as the first and only sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our submission to the FDA for Cologuard included the results of our pivotal DeeP-C clinical trial that had over 10,000 patients enrolled at 90 enrollment sites in the U.S. and Canada. The results of our DeeP-C clinical trial for Cologuard were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2014. The peer-reviewed study, &#8220;Multi-target Stool DNA Testing for Colorectal-Cancer Screening,&#8221; highlighted the performance of Cologuard in the trial population: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Cancer Sensitivity: 92% 

&#183; 

High-Grade Dysplasia Sensitivity: 69% 

&#183; 

Specificity: 87% 

&#160; 

The competitive advantages of sDNA screening provide a significant market opportunity. Assuming a 30-percent test adoption rate in the screening population and a three-year screening interval, we estimate the potential U.S. market for sDNA screening to be more than $ 4 billion , annually . 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Cologuard Commercialization Strategy 

&#160; 

Our commercialization strategy includes three main elements with a focus on physicians, patients, and payors. 

&#160; 

Physicians and Patients &#160; 

&#160; 

We are engaging physicians with several strategies. We have a 260 person sales team, including approximately 210 in a direct field sales force, actively engaging with physicians and their staffs to emphasize the need for colorectal cancer screening, educate them on the value of Cologuard, and enroll them in our physician ordering system to enable them to prescribe the test. We are focused on specific physicians based on specialty and propensity to prescribe colorectal cancer screening tests. We are also focused on physician groups and larger regional and national health systems. We are engaged in a co-promotion agreement with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals under which its 160 clinical sales specialists promote Cologuard across the United States. Further, to build awareness, we have launched a medical education program that includes on-line training and peer-to-peer presentations. 

&#160; 

Securing inclusion in guidelines is a key part of our physician engagement strategy since many physicians rely on such guidelines when making screening recommendations. Professional colorectal cancer screening guidelines in the U.S., including those of the ACS, the American College of Gastroenterology, and the American Gastroenterological Association, recommend regular screening by a variety of methods. Since 2008, joint colorectal cancer screening guidelines endorsed by the ACS and the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer have included sDNA screening technology in national colorectal cancer screening guidelines as a screening option for the detection of colorectal cancer in average risk, asymptomatic individuals age 50 and older. The U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer is a consortium of several organizations that includes representatives of the American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the American College of Physicians/Society of Internal Medicine. In October 2014 the ACS updated its colorectal cancer screening guidelines to specifically include Cologuard as a recommended sDNA screening test. 

&#160; 

In October 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force ( &#8220; USPSTF &#8221; ) issued a draft recommendation statement for colorectal cancer screening, which recommends an "A" grade for colorectal cancer screening starting at age 50 and continuing until age 75. The draft recommends certain screening tests and includes Cologuard as an alternative screening test, along with CT colonography. This approach, if adopted in the final recommendation statement, would represent a change from the 2008 USPSTF recommendations, which assigned specific grades for different tests, including an "I" rating for stool-based DNA. The USPSTF is expected to issue final recommendations during the second half of 2016. &#160; Inclusion within the USPSTF recommendation statement is important for a number of reasons. For example, the Affordable Care Act requires that health insurers cover prevent ive services graded &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;B&#8221; by USPSTF without imposing any patient cost-sharing. Also, quality measures, such as the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ( &#8220; HEDIS &#8221; ) measures issued by the National Committee for Quality Assurance ( &#8220; NCQA &#8221; ) generally follow the USPSTF recommendation statement . Accordingly, physicians are incentiviz ed, through various quality measurement programs that rely on HEDIS, to prescribe colorectal cancer screening tests that are included in the USPSTF recommendation statement. 

&#160; 

A critical part of the value proposition of Cologuard is our compliance program, which involves active engagement with patients and physicians. This activity is focused on enabling patients to complete Cologuard tests that have been ordered for them by their physicians and supporting physicians in their efforts to have their patients screened. 

&#160; 

After the launch of Cologuard, we initiated a significant public relations effort to engage patients. We have conducted targeted direct-to-patient advertising campaigns through social media, print and other channels. During 2016 we began to test television advertising in select markets. 

&#160; 

Payors 

&#160; 

The cornerstone of our payor-engagement strategy was securing coverage from the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services ( &#8220; CMS &#8221; ) . Medicare covers 46% of patients in the screening population for Cologuard. &#160; On October 9, 2014, CMS issued a final National Coverage Det e rmination ( &#8220; NCD &#8221; ) for Cologuard following a parallel review process with FDA. Cologuard was the first screening test approved by FDA and covered by CMS through that process . As outlined i n the NCD, Medicare Part B cover s Cologuard once every three years for beneficiaries who meet all of the 

&#160;

following criteria: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Age 50 to 85 years, 

&#183; 

Asymptomatic (no signs or symptoms of colorectal disease including but not limited to lower gastrointestinal pain, blood in stool, positive guaiac fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test), and 

&#183; 

At average risk for developing colorectal cancer (no personal history of adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn&#8217;s Disease and ulcerative colitis; no family history of colorectal cancers or adenomatous polyps, familial adenomatous polyposis, or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer). 

&#160; 

In the 201 6 Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, CMS established reimbursement for Cologuard at $ 508.87 . This represented an increase from the 2015 reimbursement rate of $492.72. Cologuard has been assigned a new American Medical Association CPT code (81528), and CMS has issued a determination that, effective January 1, 2016, code 81528 is reimbursed on the same basis as the G0464 code, which it replac ed . Payments from CMS are subject to sequestration. &#160; U nder the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (&#8220;PAMA&#8221;), the basis for Cologuard&#8217;s CMS reimbursement rate is expected to change, beginning in January 2017 unless the PAMA implementation date is delayed . CMS issued proposed regulations for the implementation of PAMA on September 25, 2015, but these regulations had not been finalized as of February 24, 2015. Under PAMA and the currently proposed regulations , the CMS reimbursement rate for Cologuard is expected to be calculated based on the volume- weighted median of private payor rates . &#160; F or the initial rates calculated under PAMA, currently scheduled to tak e effect January 1, 2017, the calculation would be based on the volume- weighted median of private payor rates during the period July 1 , 2015 through December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

W hile we consider the current level of Medicare reimbursement for Cologuard to be adequate, w e believe it is necessary to &#160; secure favorable coverage and reimbursement from commercial payors in order for Cologuard to achieve its full commercial potential . Some third-party commercial payors including Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of California and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts have agreed to cover Cologuard as an in-network service, and we are working with many other insurers to add coverage for Cologuard. We believe that commercial payors&#8217; reimbursement of Cologuard will depend on a number of factors, including payors&#8217; determination that it is: sensitive and specific for colorectal cancer; not experimental or investigational; approved or recommended by major guidelines organizations; reliable, safe and effective; medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; and cost-effective . &#160; We are pursuing a variety of strategies to increase commercial payor coverage for Cologuard including &#160; providing cost effectiveness data to payors to make the case for Cologuard reimbursement. We are focusing our efforts on large national and regional insurers, insurers in states that require health insurers to cover colorectal cancer screening and health plans that have affiliated health systems. In certain situations where we believe payors are already legally required to cover Cologuard, we have sued to enforce those coverage obligations. We may consider similar litigation in the future. &#160; 

&#160; 

We believe quality metrics will shape payors&#8217; coverage decisions, as well as physcians&#8217; cancer screening procedures. In recent years the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment and value-based purchasing of healthcare services. Some government and private payors are adopting pay-for-performance programs that differentiate payments for healthcare services based on the achievement of documented quality metrics, cost efficiencies or patient outcomes. Payors may look to quality measur es such as the NCQA, HEDIS and the CMS Star ratings to assess quality of care. These programs are intended to provide incentives to service providers to deliver the same or better results while consuming fewer resources. We believe inclusion of Cologuard in the HEDIS measures and the Star ratings will influence payors&#8217; willingness to reimburse our Cologuard test and physicians&#8217; willingness to prescribe Cologuard. Recommendations issued by the USPSTF, as well as other healthcare guidelines, may affect how quality programs rate various preventative services. 

Our Clinical Lab Facility 

As part of our comm ercialization strategy, we established a state of the art, highly automated lab facility that is certified pursuant to federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments &#160; (&#8220; CLIA &#8221;) requirements to process Cologuard tests and provide patient results. Our commercial lab operation is housed in a 32,000 square foot facility in Madison, Wisconsin. At our lab, we currently have the capacity to process approximately one million tests per year, and have the opportunity available to us to build out additional lab space, if needed. &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Product Pipeline 

We also are focused on developing our pipeline for future products and services . We are continuing to collaborate with MAYO Foundation for Medical Education and Research (&#8220; MAYO &#8221;) on future tests, including those for the detection of lung, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers . &#160; The American Cancer Society estimates that lung cancer will be diagnosed in 221,200 Americans and cause 158,040 deaths in the United States this year and that, world-wide, lung cancer will be diagnosed in 1,825,000 people and cause 1,590,000 deaths. Currently, more than half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage, after symptoms appear, when the five-year survival rate is in the low single digits. If detected at an early stage, lung cancer's five-year survival rate can be as high as 80 percent. Our current focus for lung cancer is to develop a test to detect cancer in lung nodules which is a shift from the product development efforts that were underway with MD Anderson. T herefore , we have mutually agreed to terminate our agreement with MD Anderson effective February 2016. 

&#160; 

G astrointestinal cancers account for 145,000 or 25% of all U.S. cancer deaths annually and represent a significant market opportunity for future products. In February 2015, we amended and restated our license agreement with MAYO to extend our working relationship for an additional five years , and in January 2016, we further amended our license agreement to broaden our collaboration efforts to develop screening, surveillance and diagnostic tests and tools to cover all types of cancers, pre-cancers, diseases and conditions , not just those affecting gastrointestinal organs. 

&#160; 

We also plan to continue to explore opportunities for improving Cologuard, including improvements that could lower our cost of sales . 

&#160; 

Competition &#160; 

The market for colorectal cancer and pre-cancer screening is large, consisting of more than 80 million Americans age 50 and above, and has attracted numerous competitors, some of which possess significantly greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than we do. Our Cologuard test faces competition from procedure &#8209;based detection technologies such as flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy and &#8220;virtual&#8221; colonoscopy, a radiological imaging approach that visualizes the inside of the bowel by CT scan (spiral computerized axial tomography), as well as traditional screening tests such as FOBT and FIT and newer screening technologies such as the PillCam &#174; COLON cleared by FDA in February 2014. Our competitors may also be developing additional methods of detecting colorectal cancer and pre-cancer that have not yet been announced. 

&#160; 

In addition, a number of companies and institutions are working to develop new blood and serum &#8209;based tests for the detection of colorectal cancer or pre-cancer, including tests based on the detection of proteins , nucleic acids or the presence of fragments of mutated genes in the blood that are produced by colorectal cancer or pre-cancer. We are aware of at least five other companies&#8212;Epigenomics AG, Applied Proteomics, Inc. , Gene News, EDP Biotech Corporation and Quest Diagnostics&#8212;that are developing blood-based tests for the detection of colorectal cancer. Epigenomics AG completed a large multi-center study designed to demonstrate the performance of its blood-based screening test for colorectal cancer and submitted the results to the FDA in June 2014 . &#160; On January 8, 2016, Epigenomics AG announced th at the FDA ha d informed &#160; it that the clinical data that it had submitted regarding its blood-based screening test is sufficient for the FDA to make a final decision on premarket approval and that the FDA&#8217;s review process will be completed in the near future. &#160; On January 10, 2016, Illumina, Inc. announced the formation of GRAIL, a new company formed to develop a blood-based, pan-cancer screening test that would seek to measure circulating nucleic acids in blood using next-generation sequencing ( &#8220; NGS &#8221; ) technology. We believe other companies are also working on so-called &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221; tests using NGS technology, and these tests could represent significant competition for Cologuard and other tests we may develop. 

&#160; 

Beyond our Cologuard test, as we seek to develop other tools to detect cancer and pre-cancer, we expect to compete with a broad range of organizations in the U.S. and other countries that are engaged in the development, production and commercialization of cancer diagnostic tools. These competitors include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

b iotechnology, diagnostic and other life science companies; 

&#183; 

a cademic and scientific institutions; 

&#183; 

g overnmental agencies; and 

&#183; 

p ublic and private research organizations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors either because their products and services are superior or because they may have more expertise, experience, financial resources or stronger business relationships. These competitors may have broader product lines and greater name recognition than we do. We have limited experience developing tests for detecting non-colorectal cancers and cannot guarantee that our research and development activities will be successful in developing any marketable testing products or services. Furthermore, even if we do develop new marketable products or services, our current and future competitors may develop products and services that are more commercially attractive than ours and they may obtain FDA approval, and thus bring those products and services to market, sooner than we are able to. 

&#160; 

We believe that Cologuard, as the first and only sDNA - based non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test on the market today, compares favorably to competitor products and services for the detection of colorectal cancer and pre-cancer . All other colorectal cancer detection methods in use today are constrained by some combination of poor sensitivity, poor compliance and cost. The leading method, c olonoscopy involves advance dietary restrictions and bowel cleansing and can be uncomfortable, time &#8209;consuming , hazardous, and expensive. Colonoscopy requires sedation, lost time from work, and someone to drive the patient home from the procedure. A 2010 study shows that seven out of 10 people age 50 and older who were told they should get a colonoscopy did not do so primarily due to fears . Fecal blood testing , including FIT testing suffers from poor sensitivity, with only a &#160; 73.8 percent detection rate for cancer and 23.8 percent detection rate for pre &#8209;cancers. Blood &#8209;based DNA test s currently available are also disadvantaged by low sensitivity. Data from a validation study of one blood &#8209;based test was released in late 2011 and published in the journal G ut in February 2012 , demonstrat ing 48 percent sensitivity across all stages of cancer, with little sensitivity for pre &#8209;cancer above the background false positive rate. 

&#160; 

How We Recognize Revenue 

A large portion of our revenue is recognized upon cash receipt. For Medicare and certain other third-party payors where we have an agreed upon reimbursement rate or we are able to estimate the amount that will ultimately be received at the time delivery is complete, we recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis. Until we have contracts with or can estimate the amount that will ultimately be received from a larger number of payors, we will recognize a large portion of our revenue upon cash receipt. In the first period in which revenue is accrued for a particular payor, there generally is a one-time increase in revenue. Additionally, as we commercialize new products, we will need to be able to make an estimate of the amount that will ultimately be received for each payor for each new product offering prior to being able to recognize the related revenue on an accrual basis. Because the timing and amount of cash payments received from payors is difficult to predict, our revenue may fluctuate significantly in any given quarter. In addition, even if we begin to accrue larger amounts of revenue related to Cologuard, when we introduce new products, we do not expect we will be able to recognize revenue from new products on an accrual basis for some period of time. This may result in continued fluctuations in our revenue. 

Research and Development 

Research and development costs account for a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Our research a nd development expenses were $33.9 million , $28 .7 million and $ 27.7 million for t he years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Research and development expenses are expected to increase in the future as we work on developing additional products related to cancer screening and improving Cologuard. &#160; 

Seasonality 

We are in the early stages of Cologuard&#8217;s commercialization and are continuing to learn how seasonal factors may affect our business. Based on our experience to date, we expect some seasonal variations in our revenues due to a variety of factors such as , the year-end holiday period and other major holidays, vacation patterns of both patients and physicians, climate and weather conditions in our markets and other factors relating to the timing of patient deductibles and co-insurance limits . &#160; 

Government Regulation 

Certain of our activities are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of diagnostic products. Failure to comply with applicable requirements can lead to 

&#160;

sanctions, including withdrawal of products from the market, recalls, refusal to authorize government contracts, product seizures, civil money penalties, injunctions and criminal prosecution. 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration 

FDA granted p remarket approval ( &#8220; PMA &#8221; ) for Cologuard in August 2014. That PMA approval places substantial restrictions on how Cologuard is marketed and sold, specifically, by prescription only. Additionally, the regulations governing our approval require controls on Cologuard, including but not limited to manufacturing facility registration, Cologuard listing with the FDA, complying with labeling requirements, maintenance of a satisfactory quality management system and meeting post-market surveillance requirements. In addition, as a condition of our FDA approval, we are required to conduct a post-approval study. There can be no assurance that the results of this study will be satisfactory and will not cause the FDA to modify or withd raw our approval for Cologuard. 

We may develop new diagnostic products and services that are likely to be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. We may also develop diagnostic products or services that, under today&#8217;s laws, would not likely be regulated by the FDA, but would instead be regulated as laboratory developed tests (&#8220;LDTs&#8221;) under CLIA. However, as noted below, the regulation of LDTs may be in flux as the FDA has recently indicated it intends to exercise more oversight of LDTs. 

FDA-Regulated Medical Devices 

Unless otherwise exempted, medical devices must receive from the FDA either &#8220;510(k) clearance&#8221; or PMA before marketing them in the United States. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes may be costly and time consuming, but the PMA approval process is typically more costly, lengthy and uncertain. 

The FDA determines whether a medical device will require either 510(k) clearance or the PMA process based on statutory criteria that include the risk associated with the device and whether the device is similar to an existing, legally marketed product. If the FDA decides one of our future products may undergo the 510(k) clearance process, we would typically be required to submit a premarket notification. In the pre-market notification, we would need to demonstrate that our proposed device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; in intended use, safety and effectiveness to certain existing, legally marketed devices. If we were to obtain 510(k) clearance for a product and then make changes to that product, we would need to seek a new 510(k) clearance. 

The PMA process , which would be necessary if we could not clear a product through the 510(k) process, involves submitting extensive data to the FDA. These data allow the FDA to determine if the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process may include the convening of expert panels and inspection of our manufacturing facilities, and also include providing additional data and updates to the FDA, and new or supplemented PMA submissions if the product is modified during the process. 

Even if granted, a 510(k) clearance or PMA may place substantial restrictions on how a device is marketed or sold, and regulations governing any approved products require controls, including but not limited to registering manufacturing facilities, listing the products with the FDA, complying with labeling requirements, maintaining an adequate q uality m anagement s ystem, and meeting post-market surveillance requirements. The studies required in connection with our seeking either a 510(k) clearance or PMA for any of our new diagnostics products will be costly and time &#160; intensive. There can be no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve any 510(k) premarket notification or any PMA request submitted by us in a timely manner or at all. &#160; 

Laboratory Developed Tests 

&#160; 

We may also develop diagnostic candidates that, under today&#8217;s regulations, would likely be regulated as LDTs under CLIA. LDTs are clinical laboratory tests that are developed and validated by a laboratory for its own use. Historically, LDTs have been regulated under CLIA while the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion and not required approvals or clearances for most LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because it regulates the primary components in most LDTs and because it believed that laboratories certified as high complexity under CLIA, such as ours, have demonstrated expertise and ability in test procedures and analysis. 

&#160;

In October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents describing the proposed risk-based framework under which the FDA might regulate LDTs. The FDA&#8217;s draft framework proposed, among other things, premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared diagnostics currently on the market. In November 2015, the FDA issued a report citing evidence for the need for additional regulation of LDTs and stated the FDA is continuing to work to finalize premarket review requirements for LDTs. The FDA&#8217;s guidance documents, if and when finalized, may materially impact our development of LDTs. 

Laboratory Certification, Accreditation and Licensing 

We are also subject to U.S. and state laws and regulations regarding the operation of clinical laboratories. CLIA requirements and laws of certain other states impose certification requirements for clinical laboratories, and establish standards for quality assurance and quality control, among other things. Clinical laboratories are subject to inspection by regulators, and to sanctions for failing to comply with applicable requirements. Sanctions available under CLIA include prohibiting a laboratory from running tests, requiring a laboratory to implement a corrective plan, and imposing civil monetary penalties. If we fail to meet any applicable requirements of CLIA or state law, that failure could adversely affect any future CMS consideration of our technologies, prevent their approval entirely, and/or interrupt the commercial sale of any products and services and otherwise cause us to incur significant expense. 

HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established for the first time comprehensive protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or &#8220;Covered Entities&#8221;: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Covered Entities and their business associates must have in place administrative, physical, and technical standards to guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information. W e perform activities that may implicate HIPAA, such as providing clinical laboratory testing services and entering into specific kinds of relationships with Covered Entit ies &#160; and business associate s of Covered Entit ies . 

Our activities must also comply with other applicable privacy laws. For example, there are also state and international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain stool samples and associated patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans. 

Federal and State Billing and Fraud and Abuse Laws 

Antifraud Laws/Overpayments. W e are subject to numerous federal and state antifraud and abuse laws , including the Federal False Claims Act . Many of these antifraud laws are broad in scope, and neither the courts nor government agencies have extensively interpreted these laws. Prohibitions under some of these laws include: 

&#183; 

the submission of false claims or false information to government programs; 

&#183; 

the retention of any overpayments by governmental payors; 

&#183; 

deceptive or fraudulent conduct; 

&#183; 

excessive or unnecessary services or services at excessive prices; and 

&#183; 

prohibitions in defrauding private sector health insurers. 

We are subject to substantial penalties for violations of anti-fraud and abuse laws, including denial of payment and refunds, suspension of payments from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, as well as civil monetary and criminal penalties and imprisonment. Numerous federal and state agencies enforce the antifraud and abuse laws. In addition, private insurers may also bring private actions. In some circumstances, private whistleblowers are authorized to bring fraud suits on behalf of the government against providers and are entitled to receive a portion of any final recovery. 

In addition, amendments to the False Claims Act impose severe penalties for the knowing and improper retention of overpayments collected from governmental payors. Within 60 days of identifying an overpayment, a provider is required to notify CMS or the Medicare contractor of the overpayment and the reason for it and return the overpayment. These amendments could subject our procedures for identifying and processing payments to greater scrutiny. On 

&#160;

February 11, 2016, CMS published a final rule clarifying the obligation to report and return federal healthcare program overpayments. Overpayments may occur from time to time in the healthcare industry without any fraudulent intent. For example, overpayments may result from mistakes in reimbursement claim forms or from improper processing by governmental payors. We maintain protocols intended to identify any overpayments. From time to time we may identify overpayments and be required to refund those amounts to government payors. 

To avoid liability, we must carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, proactively monitor the accuracy and appropriateness of Medicare claims and payments received, diligently investigate any credible information indicating that we may have received an overpayment, and promptly return any overpayments. 

Federal and S tate &#8220;Self &#8209;Referral&#8221; and &#8220;Anti-K ickback&#8221; Restrictions 

If we or our operations are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations prohibiting improper referrals for healthcare services or products, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 

Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute. The federal Anti - Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs , unless an exception applies . The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; is not defined in the federal Anti- Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Sanctions for violations of the federal Anti- Kickback Statute may include imprisonment and other criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted l aws similar to the federal Anti- Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. 

Self &#8209;Referral law. The federal &#8220;self &#8209;referral&#8221; law, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Stark&#8221; law, provides that physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with a laboratory are prohibited from making a referral to that laboratory for laboratory tests reimbursable by Medicare, and also prohibits laboratories from submitting a claim for Medicare payments for laboratory tests referred by physicians who, personally or through a family member, have ownership interests in or compensation arrangements with the testing laboratory. The Stark law contains a number of specific exceptions which, if met, permit physicians who have ownership or compensation arrangements with a testing laboratory to make referrals to that laboratory and permit the laboratory to submit claims for Medicare payments for laboratory tests performed pursuant to such referrals. We are subject to comparable state laws, some of which apply to all payors regardless of source of payment, and do not contain identical exceptions to the Stark law. 

Any action against us for violation of these or similar foreign laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention from the operation of our business. 

Sunshine Act 

In 2010, Congress enacted a statute commonly known as the Sunshine Act, which aims to promote transparency. The Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, to report annually to CMS any payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, unless an exception applies . Manufacturers must also disclose to CMS any physician ownership or investment interests. Our failure to comply with the reporting requirement s of this law may subject us to substantial penalties. &#160; 

Other Laws 

Occupational Safety and Health. In addition to their comprehensive regulation of health and safety in the workplace in general, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) has established extensive requirements aimed specifically at laboratories and other healthcare &#8209;related facilities. In addition, because our operations 

&#160;

require employees to use certain hazardous chemicals, we also must comply with regulations on hazard communication and hazardous chemicals in laboratories. These regulations require us, among other things, to develop written programs and plans, which must address methods for preventing and mitigating employee exposure, the use of personal protective equipment, and training. 

Specimen Transportation. Our commercialization activities for Cologuard subject us to regulations of the Department of Transportation, the United States Postal Service and the CDC that apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens. 

Intellectual Property 

We have intellectual property rights pertaining to sample type, sample preparation, sample preservation, biomarkers, and related methods and formulations. 

Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect our technologies through patent c overage. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 26 issued patents and 22 pending patent applications in the United States, and 5 1 issued patents and 3 5 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, as part of our 2009 strategic transaction with Genzyme Corporation, we exclusive ly license back from Genzyme , in the fields of colorectal cancer screening and stool &#8209;based detection of any disease or condition , the 27 patents issued and 2 pending patent applications in the U.S., and 3 6 patents issued and 1 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions sold to Genzyme. 

Each of our patents generally has a term of 20 years from its respective priority filing date. Among our issued patents, t he first &#160; patents are set to expire in 2016 and the last patents &#160; expire i n 2033. 

License Agreements 

We license certain technologies that are, or may be, incorporated into our technology under several license agreements. Generally, the license agreements require us to pay royalties based on certain net revenues received, and may require minimum royalty amounts , milestone payments &#160; and maintenance fees. 

MAYO 

On June 11, 2009, we entered into a patent licensing agreement with MAYO Foundation for Medical Education and Research (&#8220;MAYO&#8221;). Our license agreement with MAYO was most recently amended and restated in February 2015 and further amended in January 2016. Under the license agreement, MAYO granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to certain MAYO patents and patent applications, as well as a non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide license with regard to certain MAYO know &#8209;how. The scope of the license initially covered diagnostics and screenings for stool or blood based cancer , but was later amended to cover gastrointestinal cancers, pre-cancers, diseases and conditions. Under the January 2016 amendment to the license agreement, the scope has been expanded to cover any screening, surveillance or diagnostic tests or tools for use in connection with any type of cancers, pre-cancers, diseases or conditions. 

The licensed MAYO patents and patent applications contain both method and composition &#8209;of &#8209;matter claims that relate to sample processing, analytical testing and data analysis associated with nucleic screening for cancers and other diseases. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union and Japan. In addition to granting us a license to the covered MAYO intellectual property, MAYO agreed to make available personnel to provide us product development and research and development assistance. &#160; Under the license agreement, we assumed the obligation and expense of prosecuting and maintaining the licensed MAYO patents and are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring to market products using the licensed MAYO intellectual property. 

MAYO has agreed to make available personnel through January 2020 to provide us product development and research and development assistance. 

Pursuant to our agreement with MAYO , we are required to pay MAYO a low single digit royalty on our net sales of products using the licensed MAYO intellectual property , with minimum annual royalty fees of $25,000 each year through 2033 , the year the last patent expires . The January 2016 amendment to the MAYO license agreement established various low single digit royalty rates on net sales of current and future products and clarified how net sales will be 

&#160;

calculated . As part of the amendment, the royalty rate on our net sales of Cologuard increased and, if in the future, improvements are made to the Cologuard product, the royalty rate may further increase. However, the amendment provides that the Cologuard royalty will remain a low single digit percentage of net sales. &#160; 

We are also required to issue MAYO shares of our common stock with a value of $200,000 upon commercial launch of our second and third products that use the licensed MAYO intellectual property , as well as to pay MAYO, for each of our products that use licensed MAYO intellectual property, $200,000 cash upon such product reaching $5 million in cumulative net sales, $750,000 cash upon such product reaching $20 million in cumulative net sales, and $2 million cash upon such product reaching $50 million in cumulative net sales. 

As part of the February 2015 amendment and restatement of the license agreement, we agreed to pay MAYO an additional $5,000,000, payable in five annual installments , through 2019. 

The license agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the agreement, until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2033 (or later, if certain licensed patent applications are issued). However, if we are still using the licensed MAYO know &#8209;how or certain MAYO &#8209;provided biological specimens or their derivatives on such expiration date, the term shall continue until the earlier of the date we stop using such know &#8209;how and materials and the date that is five years after the last licensed patents expires. The license agreement contains customary termination provisions and permits MAYO to terminate the license agreement if we sue MAYO or its affiliates, other than any such suit claiming an uncured material breach by MAYO of the license agreement. 

Hologic 

In October 2009, we entered into a technology license agreement with Hologic, Inc. (&#8220;Hologic&#8221;). Under the license agreement, Hologic granted us an exclusive, worldwide license within the field of human stool based colorectal cancer and pre &#8209;cancer detection or identification with regard to certain Hologic patents, patent applications and improvements, including Hologic&#8217;s Invader detection chemistry (the &#8220;Covered Hologic IP&#8221;). The licensed patents and patent applications contain both method and composition &#8209;of &#8209;matter claims. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Australia and Japan. The license agreement also provided us with non &#8209;exclusive, worldwide licenses to the Covered Hologic IP within the field of clinical diagnostic purposes relating to colorectal cancer (including cancer diagnosis, treatment, monitoring or staging) and the field of detection or identification of colorectal cancer and pre &#8209;cancers through means other than human stool samples. In December 2012 we entered into an amendment to this license agreement with Hologic pursuant to which Hologic granted us a non &#8209;exclusive worldwide license to the Covered Hologic IP within the field of any disease or condition within, related to or affecting the gastrointestinal tract and/or appended mucosal surfaces. 

We are required to pay Hologic a low single digit royalty on our net sales of products using the Covered Hologic IP. 

Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement, the license agreement will remain in effect until the last of the licensed patents expires in 20 29 . The agreement contains customary termination provisions which, among other things, permits termination in the event of material uncured breaches. 

MDx Health 

In July 2010, we entered into a technology license and royalty agreement with MDx Health S.A. (formerly Oncomethylome Sciences, S.A.) (&#8220;MDx Health&#8221;). Under the license agreement, MDx Health granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to sell products, and a U.S. license to sell services, in the field of in vitro diagnostic testing of fecal samples for detection of colorectal cancer and colorectal pre &#8209;cancer to certain patents and patent applications related to DNA methylation biomarkers. The licensed patents and patent applications contain both method and composition &#8209;of &#8209;matter claims. The jurisdictions covered by these patents and patent applications include the U.S., Canada, the European Union, China and Japan. Under the agreement, we are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to bring to market products using the licensed MDx Health patents. We are required to pay MDx Health a minimum royalty fee of $100,000 on each anniversary of the agreement for the life of the contract. In July 2015, we paid MDx Health $150,000 after we reached net sales of $10 million of a licensed product after receipt of FDA approval. We are also required to pay MDx Health $750,000 after we reach &#160; cumulative net sales of $50 million, and $1 million after we reach net sales of $50 million in a single calendar year. We are also required to pay MDx Health a low single digit 

&#160;

royalty on our net sales of licensed products and services. Unless earlier terminated by the parties in accordance with the agreement, the license agreement will remain in effect until the last of the licensed patents expires in 2028. The agreement contains customary termination provisions which, among other things, permit termination in the event of material uncured breaches. 

International Expansion 

Our initial efforts for international expansion are focusing on select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia for the launch of Cologuard. There is a significant unmet need in the se markets as it relates to colorectal cancer screening. We received a CE mark for Cologuard in December 2014 , which is a mandatory &#160; conformity mark for certain products sold within the European Economic Area . We anticipate that o ur continued international efforts during 201 6 will be limited and focused. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had &#160; 677 full &#8209;time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
