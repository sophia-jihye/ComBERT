 ITEM 1. Business &#160;

Overview 

&#160;

alpha-En Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on March 7, 1997 under the name Avenue Entertainment Group, Inc. On June 9, 2008, we changed the name of the Company to alpha-En Corporation, and effective July 22, 2008, our trading symbol was changed to &#8220;ALPE.&#8221;

&#160;

From 1997 to September 2005, we were an independent entertainment company that produced feature films, television films and made-for-television/cable movies. We cut back daily operations in late 2005 and essentially ceased daily operations from May 2006 through June 2008. Since 2008, the focus of our business has been developing new technologies for manufacturing highly pure lithium metal, a raw material for use in lightweight, high energy density batteries, in an environmentally friendly manner for commercial purposes. In 2013, we invented a new process for the production of highly pure lithium metal and associated products at room temperature. We subsequently broadened our focus to develop products and processes derived from our new core proprietary technology, including battery components and compounds of lithium.

&#160;

Lithium is the lightest of all metals and has the highest electrochemical potential, making lithium the raw material of choice for batteries. There is a substantial existing market for lithium metal in primary non-rechargeable batteries and an emerging market for rechargeable lithium metal batteries, including next-generation batteries under development.

&#160;

In September 2014, we formed Clean Lithium Corporation under the laws of New York State as a majority owned subsidiary. We formed Clean Lithium Corporation to further develop and commercialize our technology and we owned approximately 91.7% of its capital stock as of December 31, 2015. Clean Lithium Corporation holds our core intellectual property, including several patent applications and licenses discussed further in the &#8220;Our Technology&#8221; section below. In 2016 we dissolved our two inactive subsidiaries, Avenue Pictures, Inc. and Wombat Productions, Inc.

&#160;

As described above under the heading &#8220;Explanatory Note,&#8221; this Comprehensive Form 10-K is being filed by us in order to become current in our filing obligations under the Exchange Act, and additional filings subsequent to this Comprehensive Form 10-K will be required before we become current with such obligations. As a result, this report is for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, in lieu of separate reports for each of those fiscal years. Additionally, because of the amount of time that has passed since our last periodic report was filed with the SEC, the information included herein relating to our business and related matters is focused on our more recent periods.

&#160;

Our Technology 

&#160;

Based on results to date, including what we believe to be multiple analyses of the process from outside laboratories, we believe that our proprietary technology offers a number of advantages over lithium production methods currently in use. We also believe based on results to date that the resulting products have a number of advantages over other lithium products produced via the traditional ingot method. Traditionally, industrial production of lithium metal involved the electrolysis of molten salts at temperatures at and above 400&#176; Celsius (752&#176; Fahrenheit). Maintaining these salts at high heat levels adds meaningful production costs to the process, including the production of chlorine gas as a byproduct. We intend to continue developing the intellectual property associated with our core technology; broaden our patent portfolio and scale up our production of various products.

&#160;

Our proprietary technology allows for processing lithium at room temperature of 30&#176; Celsius and allows for the use of lithium carbonate as a primary feed stock. We believe the advantages of our process and products include:

&#160;

&#183; lower process temperatures and high electrical efficiency, leading to lower manufacturing costs; &#160;

&#160; &#183; reduced environmental risks, containment costs and regulatory concerns resulting in the elimination chlorine gas from the production process; &#160;

&#160; &#183; feedstock flexibility through the use of various grades of lithium carbonate as the feed stock, and reduced non-core hazardous by-products typically produced when processing halide salts of lithium; &#160;

&#160; &#183; electrolytic deposition of highly pure lithium on a myriad of different substrates in custom form factors with custom protective conductive coatings; &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; reduced presence of trace metals or undesired substances in the final products. &#160;

Starting in 2012, we devoted our resources internally to developing a technology to manufacture lithium metal, from the lab bench to the manufacturing floor. We are still in the development stages, but we believe this process and resulting products may be commercially viable and we are taking preliminary steps toward scaling-up our manufacturing design while we continue to optimize development efforts.

&#160;

Through our subsidiary, Clean Lithium Corporation, we have filed a number of patent applications based on our proprietary room temperature, flexible and energy efficient process. This proprietary process uses lithium carbonate as a feedstock and does not produce chlorine gas as a by-product. These patent applications held by Clean Lithium Corporation include:

&#160;

&#183; U.S. Patent Application No. 14/328,613, Filed July 10, 2014 &#8211; Producing Lithium &#183; PCT Application No. PCT/US2015/039768, Filed July 9, 2015 &#8211; Producing Lithium &#183; U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/262,438, Filed December 3, 2015 &#8211; Method for Producing a Lithium Film &#183; PCT Application No. PCT/US2016/033445, Filed May 20, 2016 &#8211; High Purity Lithium and Associated Products and Processes &#183; U.S. Patent Application No. 15/160,013, Filed May 20, 2016- High Purity Lithium and Associated Produces and Processes &#160;

The provisional patent application, Method for Producing a Lithium Film, includes certain intellectual property that has been jointly developed in partnership with the City University of New York and has been exclusively licensed to alpha-En.

&#160;

Clean Lithium Corporation&#8217;s patent applications encompass a broad portfolio of products and processes derived from our core lithium production technology, ranging from processes to produce compounds of lithium, battery components and battery technology using our high purity lithium metal products.

&#160;

We have entered into research agreements with a number academic research institutions as part of our process for developing and validating our core technology. The institutions include Argonne National Laboratory, the City University of New York, and Princeton University. Argonne National Laboratory is contracted with us to conduct optimization of our process, development work relating to the scale-up of our technology, characterization of our new materials and electrochemical (battery) testing of our high purity lithium anodes. The City University of New York assists us in producing samples and characterizing the resulting materials, and in testing new process equipment and products developed by our in-house research and development team. Princeton University assists us with research and development relating to the use of our lithium anode in batteries.

&#160;

Prior to 2012 we also pursued a strategy of in-licensing. On February 25, 2009, we were granted an exclusive, worldwide, transferable, perpetual license to use certain proprietary technology for the processing of lithium for use in batteries and other fields. Commencing in October 2010, working through a third party, we conducted a series of tests to determine if the process worked and, based on the results, initially believed that the process produced lithium, however it did not prove to be commercially feasible and research and development efforts involving this license were abandoned. In exchange for the license, we had certain financial, share issuance and royalty obligations if certain sale thresholds were met. However, since such thresholds were not met and the technology was not used, we are currently negotiating an amendment and release related to this license.

&#160;

During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our operations primarily included activities related to development of our technology and maintaining our public company status. We have had no revenues in any of these years as our business was in the development stage.

&#160;

Currently, we are attempting to further develop the intellectual property associated with our core technology; broaden our patent portfolio; scale up our production of various products; and begin generating revenue; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to further develop our technology and generate revenue and in our ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering, there can be no assurance that we will succeed. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering and to further develop our technology and generate sufficient revenue.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The market for the lithium and related products is highly competitive. There are numerous competitors in the industry, most of which have substantially more financial resources, greater manufacturing capacity, research and development capability, and marketing resources than us.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Lithium metal is classified as a hazardous material, and some of the chemicals we use are also classified as hazardous materials. We are required by law to comply with environmental regulations pertaining to the use, handling, and disposal of lithium metal as well as the other chemicals. Lithium battery chemistries react adversely with water and water vapor, and under certain circumstances can cause fires. As such, lithium based batteries are subject to government regulation in various jurisdictions. We ship out small quantities lithium metal samples and we conform to the regulatory requirements associated with such transportation.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of October 11, 2016, we have six full-time employees and no part-time employees. We also engage four consultants who work on a part-time basis. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also occasionally engage consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff. We also rely on outsourced research and development relationships with a number academic research institutions as part of our process for developing and validating our core technology.
