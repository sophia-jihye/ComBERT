 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are an emerging growth company providing technology solutions to improve the clinical effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare insurers and physician groups. Our mission is to develop, manufacture and market innovative proprietary products and services that assist our customers in evaluating and treating chronic diseases. In 2011, we began commercializing our first patented and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared product, which measured arterial blood flow in the extremities to aid in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease, or PAD. In March 2015, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the next generation product, QuantaFlo&#8482;, which we began commercializing in August 2015. In April 2015, we launched our multi-test service platform, WellChec&#8482;, to more comprehensively evaluate our customers&#8217; patients for chronic disease . We believe the combination of our proprietary PAD test, QuantaFlo&#8482;, and our multi-test service platform, WellChec&#8482;, position us to provide valuable information to our insurance company and physician customers, which in turn permit them to guide patient care and close the gap between the cost of patient care and compensation for providing that care.

&#160;

In the year ended December 31, 2015 we had total revenue of $7,001,000 and a net loss of $8,501,000 compared to total revenue of $3,635,000 and a net loss of $4,515,000, in 2014. 

&#160;

We were originally formed as an Oregon corporation in 2007, by our co-founder and Chairman, Dr. Semler, who invented the technology behind our products. In 2013, prior to our initial public offering, we reincorporated in Delaware.

&#160;

Our Products and Services 

&#160; 

We currently market only one patented and FDA-cleared product, QuantaFlo&#8482; , and our multi-test service platform, WellChec&#8482;, to our customers. QuantaFlo&#8482; is a four-minute in-office blood flow test. Healthcare providers can use blood flow measurements as part of their examinations of a patient&#8217;s vascular condition, including assessments of patients who have vascular disease. The following diagram illustrates the use of QuantaFlo&#8482; : 

&#160;

&#160;

QuantaFlo&#8482; features a sensor clamp that is placed on the toe or finger much like current pulse oximetry devices. Infrared light emitted from the clamp on the dorsal surface of the digit is scattered and reflected by the red blood cells coursing through the area of illumination. Returning light is &#8216;sensed&#8217; by the sensor. A blood flow waveform is instantaneously constructed by our proprietary software algorithm and displayed on the video monitor. Both index fingers and both large toes are interrogated, which takes about 30 seconds for each. A 

&#160;

1&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

hardcopy report form is generated that displays four waveforms and the ratio of each leg measurement compared with the arms. Results are classified as Flow Obstruction or No Flow Obstruction.

&#160;

We have primarily developed a license model rather than an outright sales model for QuantaFlo&#8482; . This license model eliminates the need to make a capital equipment sale. Consequently, we generally require no down payment or long-term commitment from our customers. QuantaFlo&#8482; has an expected average lifetime of at least three years. We intend to reevaluate the monthly price periodically in consideration of the revenue generation associated with QuantaFlo&#8482; . To date, we roughly estimate that routine office usage of the QuantaFlo&#8482; has ranged from a few tests per week up to 10 tests per day. We also offer contracts in which we invoice on a per test basis for use of QuantaFlo&#8482;, or as part of the WellChec&#8482; multi-test platform. 

&#160;

QuantaFlo&#8482; is also the centerpiece of our wellness diagnostic testing service, known as WellChec&#8482;. WellChec&#8482; provides testing equipment and third-party personnel to perform tests and examinations of patients for our customers. We invoice on a fee per test or per examination basis for this service. The tests performed are for chronic disease states, which include respiratory disease, vascular disease, eye disease, bone disease, heart disease, neuropathy and diabetes.

&#160;

We have placed our QuantaFlo&#8482; product with cardiologists, internists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, podiatrists and family practitioners and organizations including healthcare insurance plans, integrated delivery networks, independent physician groups and companies contracting with the healthcare industry. Our WellChec&#8482; service platform is generally targeted to health insurance plans and other healthcare organizations.

&#160;

Other Blood Flow Testing Methods 

&#160;

Blood flow is the amount of blood delivered to a given region per unit time, whereas blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of arteries. Given a fixed resistance, blood flow and blood pressure are proportional. The traditional ankle brachial index, or ABI, with Doppler test uses a blood pressure cuff to measure the systolic blood pressure in the lower legs and in the arms. A blood pressure cuff is inflated proximal to the artery in question. Using a Doppler device, the inflation continues until the pulse in the artery ceases. The blood pressure cuff is then slowly deflated. When the artery&#8217;s pulse is re-detected through the Doppler probe the pressure in the cuff at that moment indicates the systolic pressure of that artery. The test is repeated on all four extremities. Well-established criteria for the ratio of the blood pressure in a leg compared to the blood pressure in the arms are used to assess the presence or absence of flow obstruction. Generally these tests take 15 minutes to perform and require a vascular technician to be done properly. Like QuantaFlo&#8482;, the traditional analog ABI test with Doppler is a non-invasive physiologic measurement that may be abnormal in the presence of PAD. Alternatively, primary care physicians may palpate the pedal pulses to assess blood flow in the lower extremities. However, pulse palpation is generally not sensitive for the detection of vascular disease. Other options to detect arterial obstructions are imaging systems that use ultrasound, x-ray technology or magnetic resonance to obtain anatomic information about blood vessels in the legs. However, as compared to QuantaFlo&#8482;, imaging tests are much more expensive and are performed by specialists in special laboratories or offices.

&#160;

Market Opportunity 

&#160;

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, was signed in March 2010. This sweeping law is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. This legislation includes reforms and reductions that have affected Medicare reimbursements and health insurance coverage for certain services and treatments. The Health Care Reform Law has brought a new way of doing business for providers and health insurance plans. We believe that fee-for-service programs will be reduced in favor of capitated programs that pay a monthly fee per patient.

&#160;

Fee-for-service is a payment model where services are unbundled and paid for separately. In health care, it gives an incentive for physicians to provide more treatments because payment is dependent on the quantity of care, rather than quality of care. Capitation is a payment arrangement that pays a physician or group of physicians a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to them, per period of time, whether or not that person seeks care. The amount of remuneration is based on the average expected healthcare utilization of that patient, with greater payment for patients with significant medical history. For Medicare Advantage patients, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid

&#160;

2&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Services, or CMS, pays a fee per patient, also known as capitation. CMS uses risk adjustment to adjust capitation payments to health plans, either higher or lower, to account for the differences in expected health costs of individuals. Accordingly, under CMS guidelines, risk factor adjustments per patient will provide payment that is higher for sicker patients who have conditions that are codified. Accordingly, there is a financial incentive to identify those Medicare Advantage patients that are sicker, including those that have undiagnosed ailments such as PAD.

&#160;

The coding system used by CMS for the Medicare Advantage program is a hierarchical condition category, or HCC, diagnostic classification system that begins by classifying over 14,000 diagnosis codes into 805 diagnostic groups, or DXGs. Each code maps to exactly one DXG, which represents a well-specified medical condition, such as DXG 96.01 precerebral or cerebral arterial occlusion with infarction. DXGs are further aggregated into 189 condition categories, or CCs. CCs describe a broader set of similar diseases. Diseases within a CC are related clinically and with respect to cost. An example is CC96 Ischemic or Unspecified Stroke, which includes DXGs 96.01 and 96.02 acute but ill-defined cerebrovascular disease. We believe that quality of care measured by completeness and wellness is an economic benefit. These changes are already in place for the approximately 17 million participants in the Medicare Advantage program and are expected to expand to more types of insured patients as healthcare reform is deployed.

&#160;

Undiagnosed vascular disease of the legs has been called a major under-diagnosed health problem in the United States by the National Institute of Health and the Wall Street Journal. We believe vascular disease in leg arteries is undiagnosed in 75% of cases, which is about 12 million Americans. Known as peripheral artery disease, or PAD, this condition is a common and deadly cardiovascular disease that is often undiagnosed. PAD develops when the arteries in the legs become clogged with plaque &#8212; fatty deposits &#8212; that limit blood flow to the legs. As with clogged arteries in the heart, clogged arteries in the legs place patients at an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Published studies have shown that persons with PAD are four times more likely to die of heart attack, and two-three times more likely to die of stroke. According to a study by P.G. Steg published in the JAMA, patients with PAD have a 21% event rate of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular hospitalization within 12 months. The SAGE Group has estimated that as many as 18 million people are affected with PAD in the United States alone and A.T. Hirsch et al. in a JAMA published article further estimate that only 11% have claudication (pain on exertion), a classic symptom of PAD. One can lower the risks associated with PAD if the disease is detected, with early detection providing the greatest benefit.

&#160;

Many people affected with PAD do not have noticeable symptoms. When symptoms of PAD are present, they often include fatigue, heaviness, cramping or pain in the legs during activity, leg or foot pain, sores, wounds or ulcers on the toes, feet, or legs, which are slow to heal. Persons with PAD may become disabled and not be able to work, and can even lead to amputations. According to the SAGE Group, there are approximately 160,000 amputations due to PAD per year and, according to the National Limb Loss Information Center, an estimated 2 million Americans are amputees.

Risk factors for developing PAD include:

&#160; &#8226; Age (over 50 years) &#160; &#8226; Race (African-American) &#160; &#8226; History of smoking &#160; &#8226; Diabetes &#160; &#8226; High blood pressure &#160; &#8226; High blood cholesterol &#160; &#8226; Personal history of vascular disease, heart attack, or stroke. &#160;

We believe medical personnel who care for those older than 50 years are the target market for QuantaFlo&#8482;, along with those insurance plans that have a high number of Medicare Advantage patients. Based on U.S. Census data, we believe there are more than 80 million older Americans who could be evaluated for the presence of PAD.

&#160;

According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, there are over 200,000 internists, family practitioners and gerontologists in the United States. In addition, based on American Heart Association data, there are over 20,000 cardiologists and 7,500 vascular and cardiovascular surgeons. Also, there are millions of diabetic patients seen routinely by endocrinologists. Many podiatrists who see patients with these problems and orthopedic surgeons may see value in screening patients for circulation issues prior to leg procedures. Neurologists may need a tool to differentiate leg pain from vascular versus neurologic etiology. Nephrologists see patients with kidney disease, who have a higher frequency of PAD. Wound care centers need to know the adequacy of limb perfusion. We expect that each physician will have many patient visits annually from people older than 50 years. While, it is

&#160;

3&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

standard practice to ask about symptoms of PAD and to feel for diminished pulses on physical exam, we believe that it is often the case in busy practices, that the questions go unasked.

&#160;

Generally speaking, individual products are not specifically approved by name under a third-party payor code. Physicians who seek reimbursement for PAD testing procedures are likely to use codes that describe non-invasive physiologic testing of extremities. We do not track directly how physicians code for and receive payment for such procedures.

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

Our mission is to develop, manufacture and market proprietary products and services that assist healthcare providers in evaluating and treating chronic diseases. We intend to do this by:

&#160;

&#8226; Targeting customers with patients at risk of developing PAD . Healthcare providers use blood flow measurements as part of their assessment of a patient&#8217;s vascular condition. Our strategy is to keep marketing QuantaFlo&#8482; on a license-based model to insurance plans and medical personnel who care for those older than 50, including cardiologists, internists, nephrologists, endocrinologist, podiatrists, and family practitioners. Specifically, we believe there are more than 250,000 physicians and other potential customers in the United States alone, many of whom care for patients will be more than 50 years old and at increased risk of developing PAD. Based on U.S. Census data, the evaluable patient population for QuantaFlo&#8482; is estimated to be more than 80 million patients in the United States annually. &#160;

&#8226; Expanding the tools available to internists and non-peripheral vascular experts . Our intention is to provide a tool to internists and non-peripheral vascular experts, for whom it was previously impractical to conduct a blood flow measurement unless in a specialized vascular laboratory. For vascular specialists, QuantaFlo&#8482; does not require the use of blood pressure cuffs (which should not be used on some breast cancer patients), and measures without blood pressure in obese patients and patients with non-compressible, hard, calcified arteries. Currently, these patients often are unable to be measured satisfactorily with traditional analog ABI devices. &#160;

&#8226; Developing additional product and service offerings that allow healthcare providers to deliver cost-effective wellness and receive increased compensation for their services . We recently received FDA 510(k) clearance of our product, QuantaFlo&#8482;, reflecting several updates and modifications to the original model that were developed in conjunction with our consultant engineering groups. We are also exploring potential new product and service offerings, and also launched WellChec&#8482; in April 2015. These product and service offerings are designed to provide cost-effective wellness solutions for our growing, established customer base. Our goal is to achieve a reputation for outstanding service and the provision of cost-effective wellness solutions, while leveraging our gains in the marketplace for such product and service offerings. &#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We provide our QuantaFlo&#8482; product and WellChec &#8482; services to our customers through our salespersons and our QuantaFlo&#8482; product through our co-exclusive distributor, Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc., or Bard, a large medical device company with a worldwide presence in both interventional cardiology and dialysis. We began a co-exclusive supply and distribution arrangement with Bard in late 2012 in an effort to increase our sales and marketing reach, which arrangement accounted for less than 20% of our revenues in each of 2014 and 2015. With certain exceptions, we appointed Bard on a co-exclusive basis to license QuantaFlo&#8482; to certain customers, and we retained the right to license directly to such customers as well. In addition to our co-exclusive distributor, we have direct sales and marketing representatives, who have experience selling products and services to our anticipated market. 

&#160;

We deliver our vascular testing product directly to our customers, and in-service training to the customer is provided either on-line or in person. Because QuantaFlo&#8482; is relatively easy to use training can generally be accomplished in less than one day. 

&#160;

Customers who have licensed our QuantaFlo&#8482; product may pay by credit card or check on the 15th of each month as an advance for usage during the next 30 days. In some cases, customers prefer an annual license paid in advance. We provide technical support daily, coupled directly to the manufacturing operation so that replacement products, if needed, can be shipped overnight directly to the customer. The majority of the support 

&#160;

4&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

is over the telephone and focuses on software and connectivity issues, rather than hardware. We plan to upgrade QuantaFlo&#8482; operating systems as appropriate by direct shipments. 

&#160;

In addition to the license model, which we have done historically, we have recently begun exploring other options to generate revenue from our QuantaFlo&#8482; product. We have contracts that use a fee-per-test model, in which we invoice on a per test basis for use of QuantaFlo&#8482; . We have sold QuantaFlo&#8482; equipment and license the QuantaFlo&#8482; software.

&#160;

WellChec&#8482; services are similarly marketed and sold by our direct sales and marketing team to the same group of potential customers. Generally, each test or examination that is performed has a contracted rate for which the customer is invoiced on a periodic basis.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We manufacture our product, QuantaFlo&#8482; through an independent contractor. We entered into our service and supply agreement with the contract manufacturer in April 2011 and pay our manufacturer for finished goods. The contract provides for subassemblies, product final assembly, test, serialization, finished goods, inventory and shipping operations. Our current contract will remain in force until terminated by us upon three months written notice, or until terminated by either party for cause. Although we believe we have a good working relationship with our current contract manufacturer, there are many such qualified contract manufacturers available around the country should we need to replace them or if they are not able to meet demand as we grow our business as anticipated. We believe QuantaFlo&#8482; is relatively easy to manufacture. We employ a consultant vendor qualification expert to monitor and test the quality controls and quality assurance procedures of our contract manufacturer. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The principal competitor for QuantaFlo&#8482; is the standard blood pressure cuff ankle-brachial index, or ABI, device. QuantaFlo&#8482; does not include a blood pressure cuff. We are not aware of another product that performs &#8220;digital ABI&#8221; without the use of a blood pressure cuff. There are several companies that manufacture the traditional ABI device, which range in price from $2,500 to $20,000. Some of these companies are much larger than us and have more financial resources and their own distributor network. The traditional ABI devices are differentiated by the degree of automation designed into each product. ABI devices that rely more heavily on operator assessment ( i.e. , listening to the return of pulse while decreasing cuff pressure), are thought to have less objectivity in their measurement. We know of no direct &#8216;digital ABI&#8217; competitor to QuantaFlo&#8482;. Because standard ABI devices require a better trained operator, the products are usually sold to specialized vascular labs that are supervised by a vascular surgeon, with the tests performed by a licensed vascular technician. It is not uncommon for such ABI devices to be marketed to the offices of internists, podiatrists, endocrinologists or most cardiologists. 

&#160;

Our intention is to provide a tool to internists and non-peripheral vascular experts, for whom it was previously impractical to conduct a blood flow measurement unless in a specialized vascular laboratory. For vascular specialists, QuantaFlo&#8482; does not require the use of blood pressure cuffs (which should not be used on some breast cancer patients), and measures without blood pressure in obese patients and patients with non-compressible, hard, calcified arteries. Currently, these patients often are unable to be measured with traditional analog ABI devices.

&#160;

The list of potential competitors for WellChec &#8482; services is quite extensive as any medical practitioner can perform tests and examinations. Such practitioners might be in solo or group practices or employed by a larger entity, such as a company or a medical center. Our intention is provide a comprehensive, premium delivery of diagnostic information some of which is obtained with our proprietary QuantaFlo &#8482; product. Most of the information that is collected in the WellChec&#8482; service can be obtained by competitors using available technology or products.

&#160;

Research and Development Program 

&#160;

We have dedicated, engineering consultants that are well integrated into our overall business, ranging from customer requirements to technical support. The engineering group uses our in-house quality system as its framework for new product development and release. The majority of the engineering is circuit design and

&#160;

5&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

software development, as QuantaFlo&#8482; is PC-based. We are currently developing several updates and modifications to QuantaFlo&#8482; in conjunction with our consultant engineering groups, as well as exploring potential new product and service offerings. These product and service offerings are being designed to provide cost-effective wellness solutions for our growing, established customer base. The new products and service offerings under development or that may be developed may incorporate some of our current technology or new technology. We are also directing much of our activity to building our patent portfolio and protecting proprietary positions. 

&#160;

We have sponsored several studies of our blood flow measurement products. One of these studies, the results of which were compiled in 2012 and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2013, sought to determine the frequency of finding undiscovered vascular disease in primary care practices using our vascular testing product. In the study of 632 patients at 19 office practices, the frequency of flow obstruction was 12% and of these patients, 75% did not have classic symptoms of PAD. Among other limitations of the study, the publication mentions the study&#8217;s retrospective design, no direct comparison to other vascular tests, and passive data collection such that 8% of patients had one or more missing data fields.

&#160;

Another study we sponsored was designed to assess the side by side performance of our vascular testing product compared with traditional analog ABI with Doppler measurements in medical practices. In the study of 181 limbs from 121 patients at 5 medical practices during 2012 and 2013, three techniques were used on all limbs: our test, traditional analog ABI with Doppler, and Duplex ultrasound imaging. Traditional analog ABI with Doppler was unable to perform a conclusive study in 8.7% of limbs. In the remaining limbs, our vascular testing product and the ABI with Doppler measurements were in agreement, or in other words concordant, in 78% of limbs. Among the discordant limbs, Duplex imaging judged that the true positive rate of our vascular testing product was significantly higher than that of ABI with Doppler by a 2 to 1 margin. The results of the study have not been submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal and are available as a white paper that may be shown to potential customers or other interested parties. Among other limitations of the study, the study had a small sample size, was conducted at specialty practices not primary care practices, had a retrospective design with incomplete collection of demographic information and clinical characteristics of the population, was not peer reviewed and was sponsored by us. 

&#160;

Another study also was designed to assess the side by side performance of our vascular testing product compared with traditional analog ABI with Doppler measurements in medical practices. In this prospective study at five medical practices during 2013 through 2015, 360 limbs from 180 patients were examined with three techniques: Our vascular testing product, traditional analog ABI with Doppler, and Duplex ultrasound imaging as a gold standard. Results demonstrated that our test demonstrated greater sensitivity, greater accuracy and equivalent specificity compared to ABI with Doppler measurements. The results of the study are available as a white paper. Among limitations of the study are that it had a small sample size, was conducted at a mix of primary care and specialty practices, had no formal tracking of consecutive patients, and was sponsored by us.

&#160;

Patents and Licenses 

&#160;

We have been issued one patent for our apparatus, U.S. Patent No. 7,628,760, which expires December 11, 2027. Three other U.S. patent applications are pending. Other patents are in process.

&#160;

Governmental Regulation 

&#160;

Our vascular testing product received FDA 510(k) clearance in February 2010 as a Class II Medical Device. Advanced Vascular Technologies, or AVD, an entity formerly affiliated with our co-founder and Chairman, Dr. Semler, applied for and obtained for the 510(k) clearance. However, any interests it may have had in such 510(k) clearance were subsequently assigned to us and AVD did not manufacture any products for our company. In March 2015, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for the next generation version of this product, QuantaFlo&#8482;. The Class II Medical Device designation means that QuantaFlo&#8482; is a commercial device and is currently being sold in the United States. Class II devices are subject to FDA&#8217;s general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. Pre-market review and clearance by FDA for Class II devices are generally accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure. Pre-market notification submissions are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies.

&#160;

6&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign regulations, we currently employ an established regulatory consultant specializing in medical devices to maintain our regulatory filings, monitor our on-going activities, and ensure compliance with all federal and state regulations.

&#160;

Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change. Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business.

&#160;

U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation 

&#160;

QuantaFlo&#8482; is a medical device subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform:

&#160;

&#8226; product design and development; &#160;

&#8226; product testing; &#160;

&#8226; product manufacturing; &#160;

&#8226; product safety; &#160;

&#8226; post-market adverse event reporting; &#160;

&#8226; post-market surveillance; &#160;

&#8226; product labeling; &#160;

&#8226; product storage; &#160;

&#8226; record keeping; &#160;

&#8226; pre-market clearance or approval; &#160;

&#8226; post-market approval studies; &#160;

&#8226; advertising and promotion; and &#160;

&#8226; product sales and distribution. &#160;

FDA&#8217;s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements 

&#160;

To commercially distribute in the United States, QuantaFlo&#8482; or any future medical device we develop requires or will require either prior 510(k) clearance or prior approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in class III, requiring approval of a PMA application. Both pre-market clearance and PMA applications are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of devices at the time of their clearance or approval, or subsequent to marketing. 

&#160;

510(k) Clearance Pathway 

&#160;

To obtain 510(k) clearance, a medical device manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the

&#160;

7&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

submission of PMA applications. The FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is completed, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination regarding whether a new pre-market submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to QuantaFlo&#8482; we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). We have made and plan to continue to make minor additional product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances. In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) clearance process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, the ability to rescind previously granted 510(k) clearance and additional requirements that may significantly impact the process. 

&#160;

Pre-market Approval Pathway 

&#160;

A PMA application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical and clinical trials, data and manufacturing and labeling to support the FDA&#8217;s determination that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. After a PMA application is complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, which impose elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or PMA application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 

&#160;

Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation 

&#160;

After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or pre-market pathway, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:

&#160;

&#8226; establishing registration and device listings with the FDA; &#160;

&#8226; quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; &#160;

&#8226; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e. , &#8220;off-label,&#8221; uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; &#160;

8&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226; medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; &#160;

&#8226; corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, that may present a risk to health; and &#160;

&#8226; requirements to conduct post-market surveillance studies to establish continued safety data. &#160;

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

&#160;

&#8226; untitled letters or warning letters; &#160;

&#8226; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; &#160;

&#8226; recall or seizure of our products; &#160;

&#8226; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; &#160;

&#8226; refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products; &#160;

&#8226; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals that are already granted; and &#160;

&#8226; criminal prosecution. &#160;

We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA and the California Food and Drug Branch. These inspections may include our suppliers&#8217; facilities. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing Commercial Compliance 

&#160;

Federal anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service paid for under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Possible sanctions for violation of these anti-kickback laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions.

&#160;

In addition, federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Off-label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal false claims laws. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar anti-kickback, false claims, anti-fee splitting and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and violations may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties.

&#160;

To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time-and resource-consuming. Additionally, if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the DOJ or other law enforcement agencies, the company may be required to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement.

&#160;

The U.S. and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Whenever a governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, that authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and can recommend

&#160;

9&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of devices we distribute.

&#160;

Additionally, the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The Health Care Reform Law also imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any &#8220;transfer of value&#8221; made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers, effective March 30, 2013. Such information is now made publicly available in a searchable format and device manufacturers are now required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements. 

&#160;

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160;

We cannot control whether or not providers who use QuantaFlo&#8482; will seek third-party coverage for such procedures or reimbursement. If providers intend to seek third-party coverage or reimbursement for use of QuantaFlo&#8482;, the success of our product could become dependent on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure, coverage of the codes by the third-party payors and adequate payment for the resources used.

&#160;

Physician coding for procedures is established by the American Medical Association. CMS, the agency responsible for administering Medicare, and the National Center for Health Statistics, are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals for reporting inpatient procedures, and many private payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS for Medicare as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. All physician and hospital coding is subject to change, which could impact coverage and reimbursement and physician practice behavior. We do not track denial of requests for reimbursement made by the users of QuantaFlo&#8482;. It is our belief that such denials have occurred and might occur in the future with more or less frequency. We are not in the business of performing QuantaFlo&#8482; measurements that require us to seek reimbursement from third-party payers. Many of our customers are third-party payors who pay us directly for use of our product and services. 

&#160;

Independent of the coding status, third-party payors may deny coverage based on their own criteria, such as if they believe that the clinical efficacy of a device or procedure is not well established and is deemed experimental or investigational, is not the most cost-effective treatment available, or is used for an unapproved indication. We will continue to provide the appropriate resources to patients, physicians, hospitals and insurers in order to promote the best in patient care and clarity regarding reimbursement and work to reverse any non-coverage policies. For some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, coverage and reimbursement differ from state to state, and some state Medicaid programs may not pay an adequate amount for the procedures performed with our products, if any payment is made at all. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicaid continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. National and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior. For example, if CMS decreases the monthly payment for a 65 year old patient, then the provider will have to decide which steps to eliminate from his or her routine office visits in order to maintain a profitable business model. If the time of an office visit will need to be reduced to maintain a profitable business, a provider may decide to eliminate certain services or conducting certain procedures, such as deciding not to use a thermometer, take someone&#8217;s blood pressure or use a QuantaFlo&#8482; to run an ABI test. Thus, reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS on providers may affect their decision making about which services to provide during an office visit, which could affect our company. 

&#160;

Particularly in the United States, third-party payors carefully review, have undertaken cost-containment initiatives, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products as well as any technology that they, in their own judgment, consider experimental or investigational. In addition, an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval or pre-authorization of the services that a member will receive. Many managed care 

&#160;

10&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

programs are paying their providers on a capitated basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying them a predetermined amount per member per month. The percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the United States over the next decade.

&#160;

There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

&#160;

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse 

&#160;

Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or most other federally-funded healthcare programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded healthcare programs, such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Law is subject to evolving interpretations. For example, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Law to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consultant arrangements with physicians or questionable joint venture arrangements. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Further, the recently enacted Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. 

&#160;

If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid.

&#160;

Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements in addition to individual criminal convictions. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 37 employees, 36 were full time employees and one was a part time employee. These employees included two executive officers and 24 employees dedicated to sales and marketing of our product and service. Subsequent to year end we implemented a work force reduction as part of our cost containment measures. As of the date of this annual report, we have 25 employees, 24 are full time employees and one is a part time employee. Our current employees include two executive officers and 16 employees dedicated to sales and marketing of our product and service. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We also regularly engage consultants and subcontractors on an as-needed basis.
