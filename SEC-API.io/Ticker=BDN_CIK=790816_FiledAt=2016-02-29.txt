Business

Introduction

We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT that provides leasing, property management, development, redevelopment, acquisition and other tenant-related services for a portfolio of office, industrial, retail and mixed-use properties. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 179 properties that contain an aggregate of approximately 23.0 million net rentable square feet and consist of 106 office properties, six industrial facilities, three mixed-use properties, one retail property (116 core properties), 59 properties classified as held for sale, two development properties, one redevelopment property and one re-entitlement property (collectively, the &#8220;Properties&#8221;). In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we owned economic interests in 16 unconsolidated real estate ventures (collectively, the &#8220;Real Estate Ventures&#8221;). Nine of the ventures owned 31 office buildings that contain an aggregate of approximately 4.3 million net rentable square feet; two real estate ventures owned 4.3 acres of undeveloped parcels of land; three real estate ventures owned 2.2 acres of land under active development; one real estate venture owned a residential tower that contains 345 apartment units and one real estate venture owned an apartment complex that contains 398 units. As of December 31, 2015, we also owned 412 acres of undeveloped land, of which 120 acres were held for sale, and held options to purchase a parcel containing approximately 50 additional acres of undeveloped land. As of December 31, 2015, the total potential development that these land parcels could support under current zoning, entitlements or combination thereof, amounted to 7.1 million square feet. The Properties and the properties owned by the Real Estate Ventures are located in or near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Metropolitan Washington, D.C.; Southern New Jersey; Richmond, Virginia; Wilmington, Delaware; Austin, Texas and Oakland and Concord California. In addition to managing properties that we own, as of December 31, 2015, we were managing approximately 6.5 million net rentable square feet of office and industrial properties for third parties and Real Estate Ventures. Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to square feet represent net rentable area. We do not have any foreign operations and our business is not seasonal. Our operations are not dependent on a single tenant or a few tenants and no single tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total 2015 revenue.

Organization

The Parent Company was organized and commenced its operations in 1986 as a Maryland REIT. The Parent Company owns its assets and conducts its operations through the Operating Partnership and subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership was formed in 1996 as a Delaware limited partnership. The Parent Company controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. As of December 31, 2015, the Parent Company owned a 99.1% interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining 0.9% interest in the Operating Partnership consists of common units of limited partnership interest issued to the holders in exchange for contributions of properties to the Operating Partnership. Our structure as an &#8220;UPREIT&#8221; is designed, in part, to permit persons contributing properties to us to defer some or all of the tax liability they might otherwise incur in a sale of properties. Our executive offices are located at 555 East Lancaster Avenue, Suite 100, Radnor, Pennsylvania 19087 and our telephone number is (610) 325-5600. We have offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; McLean, Virginia; Marlton, New Jersey; Richmond, Virginia; and Austin, Texas. We have an internet website at www.brandywinerealty.com. We are not incorporating by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K any material from our website. The reference to our website is an inactive textual reference to the uniform resource locator (URL) and is for your reference only.

2015 Transactions

Real Estate Acquisitions

We completed each of the transactions described below with unaffiliated third parties in arms&#8217; length transactions.

On July 7, 2015, we acquired a 0.8 acre parcel of land located at 2100 Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for $18.8 million. We funded $16.8 million of the purchase price with available corporate funds and the remaining $2.0 million of the purchase price was deferred until the earlier of the commencement of development or 24 months from settlement. We accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and capitalized a nominal amount of acquisition related costs and other costs as part of land inventory on our consolidated balance sheet. We agreed with the seller of 2100 Market Street to pay additional consideration to it if we were to acquire certain land parcels adjacent to 2100 Market Street from unaffiliated third parties. The unaffiliated third parties are not party to this 

transaction and our acquisition of any such land parcels would be the result of an arm&#8217;s length negotiation . The amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the seller of 2100 Market Street cannot be determined at this time. We have not yet determined the scope, timing and cost of construction for the project as of December 31 , 2015. 

On June 22, 2015, through a series of transactions with International Business Machines ("IBM"), we acquired the remaining 50.0% interest in Broadmoor Austin Associates, consisting of seven office buildings and the 66.0 acre underlying land parcel located in Austin, Texas, for an aggregate purchase price of $211.4 million. The aggregate purchase price includes the carrying amount of our investment in Broadmoor Austin Associates of $66.3 million. The office buildings contain 1,112,236 net rentable square feet of office space and were 100.0% occupied as of June 22, 2015. We funded the cost of the acquisition with an aggregate cash payment of $143.8 million, consisting of $81.0 million from available corporate funds and $62.8 million previously held in escrow related to a Section 1031 like-kind exchange. Part of the cash payment was used at closing to repay, at no repayment penalty, the remaining $51.2 million of secured debt. We incurred $0.2 million of acquisition related costs that are classified within general and administrative expenses. 

We previously accounted for our 50.0% non-controlling interest in Broadmoor Austin Associates under the equity method of accounting. As a result of acquiring IBM's remaining 50.0% common interest in Broadmoor Austin Associates, we obtained control of Broadmoor Austin Associates and our existing investment balance was remeasured based on the fair value of the underlying properties acquired and the existing distribution provisions under the relevant partnership agreement. As a result, we recorded a $0.8 million gain on remeasurement.

On April 6, 2015, we acquired a 0.8 acre parcel of land, located at 25 M Street Southeast, Washington, D.C. for $20.3 million. We funded the cost of this acquisition with available corporate funds. We capitalized $0.3 million of acquisition related costs and these costs are included as part of land inventory on our consolidated balance sheet. On May 12, 2015, we subsequently contributed the land parcel into a newly formed real estate venture known as 25 M Street Holdings, LLC (&#8220;25 M Street&#8221;), a joint venture between us and Jaco 25M Investors, LLC (&#8220;Akridge&#8221;), an unaffiliated third party, with the intent to construct a 271,000 square foot Class A office property. We hold a 95.0% ownership interest in 25 M Street and Akridge contributed $1.0 million in cash for its 5.0% ownership interest in 25 M Street. The $1.0 million contribution from Akridge was distributed to us during 2015. 25 M Street is consolidated within our financial statements. See Note 4, "Investment in Unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2015, 25 M Street had not finalized development plans and total development costs, or received committed debt financing.

On April 2, 2015, we acquired a property located at 618 Market Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, comprised of a 330-space parking garage and 14,404 net rentable square feet of mixed-use space for $19.4 million. Although the property is currently fully operational, we intend to either redevelop the existing property or demolish and fully redevelop the property. As of December 31, 2015, we had not yet begun any such development or redevelopment plans. The purchase price includes contingent consideration, recorded at fair value and payable to the seller upon commencement of development, totaling $1.6 million and cash of $17.8 million.

Gain on Sale is net of closing and other transaction related costs. 

&#160;

(b) 

On December 31, 2015, we contributed two newly constructed four-story, Class A office buildings, commonly known as &#8220;Encino Trace,&#8221; containing an aggregate of approximately 320,000 square feet in Austin, Texas to one of our existing real estate ventures (the &#8220;Austin Venture&#8221;) that we formed in 2013 with G&#38;I VII Austin Office LLC, an investment vehicle advised by DRA Advisors LLC (&#8220;DRA&#8221;). When we contributed these two properties to the Austin Venture we incurred a total of $76.7 million in development costs, representing the contribution value. The project is expected to cost $91.3 million with remaining costs fully funded by the Austin Venture. In conjunction with the contribution: (i) the Austin Venture obtained a $30.0 million mortgage loan; (ii) DRA contributed $25.1 million in net cash to the Austin Venture, including a $1.8 million working capital contribution; and (iii) the Austin Venture distributed $50.2 million to us and credited us with a $23.3 million capital contribution to the Austin Venture. In addition to the contribution of the properties, we also made a $1.8 million cash contribution to the Austin Venture for working capital. We recognized a $2.0 million gain on the contribution. Under the Encino Trace loan agreement the Austin Venture has the option, subject to certain leasing and loan-to-value requirements, to borrow an additional $29.7 million to fund tenant improvements and leasing commissions.

&#160;

We recorded an impairment loss of $6.3 million for the Carlsbad office properties during the fourth quarter of 2015. As such, there was no gain at disposition for this property.

Refer to Broadmoor Austin Associates acquisition summary, above, for further details.

Total gain on sale does not include a deferred gain of $0.5 million related to a prior sale.

On February 4, 2016, we disposed of our interests in 58 properties located in the Pennsylvania Suburbs, New Jersey/Delaware, Metropolitan Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia segments in a series of related transactions with Och Ziff Real Estate (referred to herein as the &#8220;Och Ziff Sale&#8221;). During the fourth quarter of 2015, significant provisions were agreed upon by both us and Och Ziff Real Estate and, as a result, we determined that the sale of the portfolio was probable and classified these properties as held for sale in accordance with applicable accounting standards for long lived assets. At such date, the carrying value of the properties exceeded the fair value less the anticipated costs of sale. As a result, we recognized an impairment loss totaling approximately $45.4 million &#160; during the year ended December 31, 2015. For further information related to the transaction see Note 21, &#8220; Subsequent Events ,&#8221; to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#160;

(b) 

On December 23, 2015, we entered into an agreement to dispose of our equity interests in the office property located at 2970 Market Street in Philadelphia commonly known as 30th Street Main Post Office (&#8220;Cira Square&#8221;), which includes 862,692 square feet of rentable space and is fully leased to a single tenant. As of December 31, 2015, we determined the sale was probable and classified the property as held for sale in accordance with applicable accounting standards for long lived assets. At such date, the fair value is the purchase price less anticipated costs to dispose of the property. As the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the property no impairment loss was recorded. On February 5, 2016 we completed the disposition of our equity interests in Cira Square.

&#160;

(c) 

On January 15, 2016, we sold the fee interest in a 120 acre land parcel located in Berks County, Pennsylvania for $0.9 million. As of December 31, 2015, we classified this land parcel as held for sale in accordance with the applicable accounting standards for long lived assets. At such date, the carrying value of the properties exceeded the fair value less the anticipated 

&#160;

costs of sale. As a result, we recognized an impairment loss totaling approximately $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The sales of our equity interests and the fee interests in the properties referenced above do not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on our operations and financial results. As a result, the operating results of these properties remain classified within continuing operations for all periods presented. See Note 21, " Subsequent Events, " to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these dispositions.

Residence Inn Tower Bridge 

On December 30, 2015, we sold our entire 50% ownership interest in an unconsolidated real estate venture known as Residence Inn Tower Bridge (the &#8220;Residence Inn&#8221;). Net proceeds to us were $6.1 million. The carrying amount of our investment in the Residence Inn amounted to $0.9 million at the sale date, resulting in a $5.2 million gain on sale of our interest in the real estate venture.

JBG Ventures

On May 29, 2015, we and an unaffiliated third party, JBG/DC Manager, LLC ("JBG"), formed 51 N 50 Patterson, Holdings, LLC Venture ("51 N Street") and 1250 First Street Office, LLC Venture ("1250 First Street"), as a real estate venture, with us owning a 70.0% interest and JBG owning a 30.0% interest in each of the two ventures. At formation, we and JBG made cash contributions of $15.2 million and $6.5 million, respectively, to 51 N Street, which was used to purchase 0.9 acres of undeveloped land. At formation, we and JBG made cash capital contributions of $13.2 million and $5.7 million, respectively, to 1250 First Street, which was used to purchase 0.5 acres of undeveloped land. See &#8220; Developments &#8221; section below. 

DRA &#8211; PA Venture

On December 19, 2007, we formed G&#38;I Interchange Office LLC, a real estate venture (the &#8220;Interchange Venture&#8221;), with an unaffiliated third party, G&#38;I VI Investment Interchange Office LLC (&#8220;G&#38;I VI&#8221;), an investment vehicle advised by DRA Advisors LLC. The Interchange Venture owned 29 office properties containing an aggregate of 1,611,961 net rentable square feet located in Montgomery, Lehigh and Bucks counties, Pennsylvania. We contributed these 29 properties to the Interchange Venture upon the Interchange Venture's formation and in exchange for the contribution received a cash distribution from the Interchange Venture and a 20.0% ownership interest in the Interchange Venture. 

Interchange Venture&#8217;s loan matured on January 1, 2015. On February 27, 2015, the Interchange Venture entered into a forbearance agreement with an unaffiliated lender that held a nonrecourse mortgage on the Interchange Venture's assets. On August 12, 2015, the lender sold the properties to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser under the forbearance agreement and assumed the proceeds. Commensurate with the sale, the Interchange Venture was dissolved. 

Austin Venture

On December 31, 2015, we contributed two newly constructed four-story, Class A office buildings, commonly known as &#8220;Encino Trace,&#8221; containing an aggregate of approximately 320,000 net rentable square feet in Austin, Texas to the Austin Venture. See Note 3, &#8220; Real Estate Investments &#8221; to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the contribution. 

On January 30, 2015, the Austin Venture closed on a mortgage loan with a non-affiliated institutional lender, and used the proceeds of the loan to repay in full an $88.0 million short-term secured loan made by us to fund costs of the Austin Venture's acquisition of River Place, a 590,881 net rentable square foot office complex in Austin, Texas. For further information regarding this acquisition, see Note 4, " Investment in Unconsolidated Ventures ," to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Developments

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 412 acres of undeveloped land, including 120 acres held for sale, and held options to purchase a parcel containing approximately 50 additional acres of undeveloped land.

JBG - Venture

51 N Street expects to construct two mixed-use buildings, which will include approximately 278,000 square feet of loft office, residential, ground floor retail, movie theater and on-grade public plaza space in Washington, D.C. 51 N Street expects to develop the office buildings on a 0.9 acre land parcel owned by the venture. As of December 31, 2015, the venture had not finalized development plans and total development costs or received committed debt financing. 

1250 First Street expects to construct an eleven-story office building, which will include approximately 232,100 square feet of office, 15,300 square feet of retail and 145 below-grade parking spaces in Washington, D.C. 1250 First Street expects to develop the office 

building on a 0.5 acres land parcel owned by the venture. As of December 31, 2015 , the venture ha d not finalized development plans and total development costs or received committed debt financing. 

FMC Tower at Cira Centre South

On October 31, 2013, we determined to proceed with development of the FMC Tower at Cira Centre South (the &#8220;FMC Tower&#8221;) (formerly the Cira Walnut Tower), designed as a trophy class, mixed-use office tower at 30th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We anticipate the project cost to total $385.0 million, of which $202.8 million had been funded through December 31, 2015. We intend to fund remaining development costs through a combination of potential sources, including existing cash balances, availability under our unsecured line of credit, capital raised through one or more joint venture formations, proceeds from asset sales or equity and debt financing. The costs to complete the project will be funded over the construction period, which commenced in the second quarter of 2014 and is scheduled to conclude during the third quarter of 2016. We are a party to a development agreement and related ground lease with the University of Pennsylvania for the land parcel that the FMC Tower is being constructed on.

As of December 31, 2015, we had pre-leased an aggregate of 61% of the office square feet of the FMC Tower. The anchor tenant for approximately 280,000 square feet of office space under a 16-year lease is FMC Corporation, a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally. In addition, we have pre-leased 100,000 square feet of office space to the University of Pennsylvania under a 20-year lease. 

Our ground leases with the University of Pennsylvania have a term through July 2097, with a variable rent that would provide the University of Pennsylvania with a percentage of the cash flow or proceeds of specified capital events subject to our receipt of a priority return on eligible investments.

1919 Ventures

On January 20, 2011, we acquired a one acre parcel of land in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for $9.3 million. We thereafter contributed the acquired land into a then newly-formed general partnership, referred to below as &#8220;1919 Ventures&#8221; in return for a 50.0% general partner interest, with the remaining 50.0% interest owned by an unaffiliated third party, who contributed cash in exchange for its interest. On October 15, 2014, we acquired the interest of the unaffiliated third party at fair value, which approximated carrying value. No remeasurement gain or loss on our previous investment was recorded at that time.

On October 21, 2014, we admitted an unaffiliated third party, LCOR/CalSTRS (&#8220;LCOR&#8221;) into 1919 Ventures, for $8.2 million representing a 50% interest and, reflecting an agreed upon $16.4 million valuation of the land and improvements incurred by us on behalf of 1919 Ventures.

On October 27, 2014, 1919 Ventures announced a planned 29-story, 455,000 square foot contemporary glass tower development. The tower has been designed as a mixed-use development consisting of residential, retail and parking components. The residential component of the project will be comprised of 321 luxury apartments. The commercial space will consist of 24,000 square feet and was 100% pre-leased at December 31, 2015. The parking component will consist of a 215-car structured parking facility. Total project costs are estimated at $148.1 million. A portion of the costs are being funded with proceeds of an $88.9 million secured construction loan from an unaffiliated institutional lender, and the remaining $59.2 million was fully funded with equity contributions from each of us and LCOR. As of December 31, 2015, $19.4 million was outstanding on the construction loan and equity contributions of $29.6 million had been funded by each of us and LCOR.

4040 Wilson Venture 

On July 31, 2013, we formed 4040 Wilson LLC Venture (&#8220;4040 Wilson&#8221;), as a joint venture between us and Ashton Park Associates LLC (&#8220;Ashton Park&#8221;), an unaffiliated third party. We and Ashton Park own a 50% interest in 4040 Wilson. 4040 Wilson expects to construct a 426,900 square foot office building representing the final phase of the eight building, mixed-use, Liberty Center complex developed by the parent company of Ashton Park in the Ballston submarket of Arlington, Virginia. 4040 Wilson expects to develop the office building on a 1.3 acre land parcel contributed by Ashton Park to 4040 Wilson at an agreed upon valuation of $36.0 million. The total estimated project costs are $194.6 million, which we expect will be financed through approximately $72.0 million of partner capital contributions (consisting of $36.0 million in cash from us, of which $35.6 million has been funded to date, and land with a value of $36.0 million from Ashton Park), with the remaining balance funded by debt financing through a construction lender that has not yet been determined. During the second quarter of 2015, 4040 Wilson completed the construction of the garage structure. We expect groundbreaking on the building structure to commence upon achievement of certain pre-leasing levels, at which point 4040 Wilson expects to obtain debt financing for the remainder of the project costs. 

Other Development Services 

On December 3, 2015, we entered into an agreement as development manager to construct Subaru of America&#8217;s corporate headquarters (the &#8220;Subaru Headquarters Development&#8221;), an office property containing five floors and approximately 250,000 square 

feet, on land owned by Subaru an d located in Camden, New Jersey. In addition to development fees, the agreement provides us the ability to earn additional profit if total project costs are less than the not-to-exceed (&#8220;NTE&#8221;) amount. The NTE amount, currently at $77.3 million, may be adj usted by change orders agreed upon by both Subaru and us. If construction costs are in excess of the NTE amount, we are obligated to pay such cost overruns. 

Also on December 3, 2015, we entered into an agreement to construct an 83,000 square foot build-to-suit service center on land parcels owned by us for Subaru of America as the single tenant. On such date, Subaru of America entered into an 18-year lease for the service center. The lease contains a purchase option, which allows Subaru to purchase the property at commencement of the lease, or five years subsequent to inception, at depreciated cost. We currently expect to deliver the building during the third quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2015, we had not finalized development plans or total development costs.

Business Objective and Strategies for Growth

Our business objective is to deploy capital effectively to maximize our return on investment and thereby maximize our total return to shareholders. To accomplish this objective we seek to:

&#160;

&#183; 

concentrate on urban town centers and central business districts in selected regions, and be the best of class owner and developer in those markets with a full-service office in each of those markets providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise; 

&#160;

&#183; 

maximize cash flow through leasing strategies designed to capture rental growth as rental rates increase and as leases are renewed; 

&#160;

&#183; 

attain a high tenant retention rate by providing a full array of property management and maintenance services and tenant service amenity programs responsive to the varying needs of our diverse tenant base; 

&#160;

&#183; 

continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality and financially stable tenants. The average lease term of the in-place leases in our core portfolio was 7.8 years on a weighted average basis at December 31, 2015 and the leases in place at December 31, 2015 with respect to approximately 7.4% of the total square feet of our core portfolio will expire during 2016; 

&#160;

&#183; 

form joint venture opportunities with high-quality partners having attractive real estate holdings or significant financial resources; 

&#160;

&#183; 

utilize our reputation as a full-service real estate development and management organization to identify acquisition and development opportunities that will expand our business and create long-term value; 

&#160;

&#183; 

increase the economic diversification of our tenant base while maximizing economies of scale; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

selectively reduce our portfolio over time, in non-core suburban properties that are not located in our core regions. 

We also consider the following to be important objectives:

&#160;

&#183; 

to acquire and develop high-quality office properties at attractive yields in markets that we expect will experience economic growth and where we can achieve operating efficiencies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

to monetize or deploy our land inventory for development of high-quality office properties, or rezone from office/industrial to residential, retail and hotel to align with market and demand shifts as appropriate; 

&#160;

&#183; 

to control development sites, including sites under option to acquire, that could support approximately 4.6 million square feet of new office, retail and residential development within our core markets; 

&#160;

&#183; 

to capitalize on our redevelopment expertise to selectively develop, redevelop and reposition properties in desirable locations that other organizations may not have the resources to pursue; 

&#160;

&#183; 

to own and develop high quality real estate meeting the demands of today&#8217;s tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, and to manage those facilities so as to continue to be the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective tenants; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

to secure third-party development contracts, which can be a significant source of revenue and enable us to utilize and grow our existing development and construction management resources. 

We expect to concentrate our real estate activities in markets where we believe that:

&#160;

&#183; 

current and projected market rents and absorption statistics justify construction activity; 

&#160;

&#183; 

we can maximize market penetration by accumulating a critical mass of properties and thereby enhance operating efficiencies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

barriers to entry (such as zoning restrictions, utility availability, infrastructure limitations, development moratoriums and limited developable land) will create supply constraints on office and industrial space; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

there is potential for economic growth, particularly job growth and industry diversification. 

Operating Strategy 

We currently expect to continue to operate in markets where we have a concentration advantage due to economies of scale. We believe that where possible, it is best to operate with a strong base of properties in order to benefit from the personnel allocation and the market strength associated with managing multiple properties in the same market. We also intend to selectively dispose of properties and redeploy capital if we determine a property cannot meet our long term earnings growth expectations. We believe that recycling capital is an important aspect of maintaining the overall quality of our portfolio.

Our broader strategy remains focused on continuing to enhance liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet through capital retention, debt reduction, targeted sales activity and management of our existing and prospective liabilities.

In the long term, we believe that we are well positioned in our current markets and have the expertise to take advantage of both development and acquisition opportunities, as warranted by market and economic conditions, in new markets that have healthy long-term fundamentals and strong growth projections. This capability, combined with what we believe is a conservative financial structure, should allow us to achieve disciplined growth. These abilities are integral to our strategy of having a diverse portfolio of assets, which will meet the needs of our tenants.

We use experienced on site construction superintendents, operating under the supervision of project managers and senior management, to control the construction process and mitigate the various risks associated with real estate development.

In order to fund developments, redevelopments and acquisitions, as well as refurbish and improve existing properties, we must use excess cash from operations after satisfying our dividend and other financing requirements. The availability of funds for new investments and maintenance of existing properties depends in large measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we can exert little control.

Policies With Respect To Certain Activities

The following is a discussion of our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by our Board of Trustees and our Board of Trustees may revise these policies without a vote of shareholders.

Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate

Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends to our shareholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in the value of Brandywine Realty Trust. 

We expect to continue our investment objectives primarily through the development, purchase or our current ownership in lease income-producing properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the properties presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such properties, in whole or in part, as circumstances warrant. Although there is no limitation on the types of development activities that we may undertake, we expect that our development activities will meet current market demand and will generally be on a build-to-suit basis for particular tenants where a significant portion of the building is pre-leased before construction begins. We continue to participate with other entities in property ownership through existing joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. Our equity investments may be subject to existing or future mortgage financing and other indebtedness that will have priority over our equity investments.

Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issuers

Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. We may enter into joint ventures or partnerships for the purpose of obtaining an equity interest in a particular property. We do not currently intend to invest in the securities of other issuers except in connection with joint ventures or acquisitions of indirect interests in properties.

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages

While our current portfolio consists of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of management or our Board of Trustees, invest in other types of equity real estate investments, mortgages and other real estate interests. We do not presently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust, but may invest in participating mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the property securing a mortgage. From time to time, we provide seller financing to buyers of our properties. We do this when the buyer requires additional funds for the purchase and provision of seller financing will be beneficial to us and the buyer compared to a mortgage loan from a third party lender.

Dispositions 

Our disposition of properties is based upon management&#8217;s periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by management or our Board of Trustees that a disposition would be in our best interests. We intend to use selective dispositions to reduce our ownership in non-core markets and fund our capital and refinancing needs.

Financing Policies

A primary objective of our financing policy has been to manage our financial position to allow us to raise capital from a variety of sources at competitive rates. Our mortgages, credit facilities and unsecured debt securities contain restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. Our charter documents do not limit the indebtedness that we may incur. Our financing strategy is to maintain a strong and flexible financial position by limiting our debt to a prudent level and minimizing our variable interest rate exposure. We intend to finance future growth and future maturing debt with the most advantageous source of capital then available to us. These sources may include the sale of wholly owned properties or interests in real estate ventures, selling additional common or preferred equity and debt securities through public offerings or private placements, utilizing availability under our credit facilities or incurring additional indebtedness through secured or unsecured borrowings. To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our shareholders each year at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. This distribution requirement limits our ability to fund future capital needs, including for acquisitions and developments, from income from operations. Therefore, we expect to continue to rely on third party sources of capital to fund future capital needs.

Guarantees

As of December 31, 2015, we have provided guarantees on behalf of certain of the real estate ventures, consisting of (i) a $24.7 million payment guaranty on the construction loan for evo at Cira; (ii) a $3.2 million payment guarantee on the construction loan for TB-BDN Plymouth Apartments; (iii) a several cost overrun guaranty on the $88.9 million construction loan for the development project being undertaken by 1919 Ventures; and (iv) a $0.5 million payment guarantee on a loan provided to PJP VII. In addition, during construction undertaken by real estate ventures, we have provided and expect to continue to provide cost overrun and completion guarantees, with rights of contribution among partners in the real estate ventures, and once construction is complete, customary environmental indemnities and guarantees of customary exceptions to nonrecourse provisions in loan agreements. For additional information regarding these real estate ventures, see Note 4, " Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures, " to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Also as of December 31, 2015, we provided a cost overrun guarantee on the Subaru Headquarters Development (See &#8220; Other Development Services &#8221; section above) for amounts in excess of the NTE amount. The NTE amount, currently at $77.3 million, may be adjusted by change orders agreed upon by both Subaru and us. We are obligated to pay for construction costs in excess of the NTE amount. The terms of the guarantee do not provide a limitation on the costs we may be responsible for. 

Working Capital Reserves

We maintain working capital reserves and access to borrowings in amounts that our management determines to be adequate to meet our normal contingencies.

Policies with Respect to Other Activities

We expect to issue additional common and preferred equity in the future and may authorize our Operating Partnership to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest, including to persons who contribute their interests in properties to us in exchange for such units. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of unaffiliated issuers and we do not intend to do so. We intend to make investments consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless because of circumstances or changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (or the Treasury Regulations), our Board of Trustees determines that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including to joint ventures in which we participate and to buyers of our real estate. We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Management Activities

We provide third-party real estate management services primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership (collectively, the &#8220;Management Companies&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015, the Management Companies were managing properties containing an aggregate of approximately 29.5 million net rentable square feet, of which approximately 23.0 million net rentable square feet related to properties owned by us and approximately 6.5 million net rentable square feet related to properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated Real Estate Ventures.

Geographic Segments 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we were managing our portfolio within seven segments: (1) Pennsylvania Suburbs, (2) Philadelphia Central Business District (&#8220;CBD&#8221;), (3) Metropolitan Washington, D.C., (4) New Jersey/Delaware, (5) Richmond, Virginia, (6) Austin, Texas and (7) California. The Pennsylvania Suburbs segment includes properties in Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties in the Philadelphia suburbs. The Philadelphia CBD segment includes properties located in the City of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. The Metropolitan Washington, D.C. segment includes properties in the District of Columbia, Northern Virginia and southern Maryland. The New Jersey/Delaware segment includes properties in Burlington and Camden counties in New Jersey and New Castle county in the state of Delaware. The Richmond, Virginia segment includes properties primarily in Albemarle, Chesterfield, Goochland and Henrico counties and one property in Durham, North Carolina. The Austin, Texas segment includes properties in the City of Austin, Texas. The California segment includes properties in the City of Oakland and the City of Concord, California. The corporate group is responsible for cash and investment management, development of certain real estate properties during the construction period, and certain other general support functions. See Note 18, &#8220; Segment Information, &#8221; to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on selected assets and results of operations of our reportable segments for the three years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

As a result of the Och Ziff Sale that occurred on February 4, 2016, we have narrowed our segments to four core markets located in: (1) Pennsylvania Suburbs, (2) Philadelphia Central Business District (&#8220;CBD&#8221;), (3) Metropolitan Washington, D.C. and (4) Austin, Texas. The Och Ziff Sale disposed of the entire Richmond, Virginia segment. Subsequent to the Och Ziff Sale, the segments previously defined as New Jersey/Delaware and California will be managed as a consolidated segment entitled &#8220;Other,&#8221; as these geographies no longer provide a significant revenue contribution. Accordingly, the chief operating decision maker is revising the management structure and allocating more resources to the four core markets beginning January 1, 2016.

Competition

The real estate business is highly competitive. Our Properties compete for tenants with similar properties primarily on the basis of location, total occupancy costs (including base rent and operating expenses), services and amenities provided, and the design and condition of the improvements. We also face competition when attempting to acquire or develop real estate, including competition from domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension funds, partnerships and individual investors. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon trends in the economies of our markets, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, land availability, our ability to obtain necessary construction approvals, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends.

Insurance

We maintain commercial general liability and &#8220;all risk&#8221; property insurance on our properties. We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future. There are types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from war, terrorism, environmental issues, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes that are subject to limitations in certain areas or which may be uninsurable risks. We exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it impractical to use insurance proceeds to fully replace or restore a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 401 full-time employees, including 12 union employees.

Government Regulations Relating to the Environment

Many laws and governmental regulations relating to the environment apply to us and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently and may adversely affect us.

Existing conditions at some of our Properties. Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on our Properties. We generally obtain these assessments prior to the acquisition of a property and may later update them as required for subsequent financing of the property or as requested by a tenant. Site assessments are generally performed to ASTM standards then existing for Phase I site assessments, and typically include a historical review, a public records review, a visual inspection of the surveyed site, and the issuance of a written report. These assessments do not generally include any soil samplings or subsurface investigations. Depending on the age of the property, the Phase I may have included an assessment of asbestos-containing materials. For properties where asbestos-containing materials were identified or suspected, an operations and maintenance plan was generally prepared and implemented. See Note 2, &#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, &#8221; to our 

C onsolidated F inancial S tatements for our evaluation in accordance with the accounting standard governing asset retirement obligations. 

Historical operations at or near some of our Properties, including the operation of underground storage tanks, may have caused soil or groundwater contamination. We are not aware of any such condition, liability or concern by any other means that would give rise to material, uninsured environmental liability. However, the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns; there may be material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns that a review failed to detect or which arose at a property after the review was completed; future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability; and current environmental conditions at our Properties may be affected in the future by tenants, third parties or the condition of land or operations near our Properties, such as the presence of underground storage tanks. We cannot be certain that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.

Use of hazardous materials by some of our tenants. Some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes on our Properties as part of their routine operations. Environmental laws and regulations may subject these tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. We generally require our tenants, in their leases, to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. These tenants are primarily involved in the life sciences and the light industrial and warehouse businesses. We are not aware of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our Properties, and we do not believe that on-going activities by our tenants will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters. Under environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable for the costs of removal, remediation or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances present or released on our Properties. These laws could impose liability without regard to whether we are responsible for, or knew of, the presence or release of the hazardous materials. Government investigations and remediation actions may entail substantial costs and the presence or release of hazardous substances on a property could result in governmental cleanup actions or personal injury or similar claims by private plaintiffs. 

Potential environmental liabilities may exceed our environmental insurance coverage limits. We carry what we believe to be sufficient environmental insurance to cover potential liability for soil and groundwater contamination, mold impact, and the presence of asbestos-containing materials at the affected sites identified in our environmental site assessments. Our insurance policies are subject to conditions, qualifications and limitations. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all liabilities for losses. 

Potential environmental liabilities may adversely impact our ability to use or sell assets. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.
