The purpose of the ETFS Gold Trust (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) is to own gold transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust (&#8220;Shares&#8221;). Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The assets of the Trust are anticipated to consist solely of gold bullion. The Trust was formed on September 1, 2009 when an initial deposit of gold was made in exchange for the issuance of 2 Baskets (a &#8220;Basket&#8221; consists of 50,000 Shares). 

The sponsor of the Trust is ETF Securities USA LLC (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;). The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the &#8220;Trustee&#8221;) and the custodian is JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., London branch (the &#8220;Custodian&#8221;). 

The Trust&#8217;s S hares at redeemable value decrease d from $ 916,197,176 at December 31, 2014 to $ 761,731,009 at December 31, 2015 , the Trust&#8217; s fiscal year end. Outstanding S hares in the Trust decrease d from 7,800,000 S hares at December 31, 2014 to 7,350,000 S hares at December 31, 2015 . 

The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The Trust has no directors, officers or employees. It does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to improve the losses caused by changes in the price of gold. The gold held by the Trust will only be delivered to pay the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8217;s Fee&#8221;), distributed to Authorized Participants (defined below) in connection with the redemption of Baskets or sold (1) on an as-needed basis to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, (2) in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. 

The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodities futures contracts regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act (the &#8220;CEA&#8221;), as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#8220;CFTC&#8221;). The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA and neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. The Trust has no fixed termination date. 

The Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.etfsecurities.com, through which the registrant&#8217;s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are made available free of charge after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC&#8217;s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. 

T rust Objective 

The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, less the expenses of the Trust&#8217;s operations. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment similar to an investment in physical gold. An investment in physical gold requires expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the assay, transportation, warehousing and insurance of the metal. Traditionally, such expense and complications have resulted in investments in physical gold being efficient only in amounts beyond the reach of many investors. 

The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means, with minimal credit risk, of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding gold bullion. The Shares offer an investment that: 

&#8226; Is Easily Accessible . The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca and provide institutional and retail investors with indirect access to the gold bullion market. The Shares are bought and sold on the NYSE Arca like any other exchange-listed securities. The close of the NYSE Arca trading session is 4:00 PM New York time. 

&#8226; Is Relatively Cost Effective. The Sponsor expects that, for many investors, costs associated with buying and selling the Shares in the secondary market and the payment of the Trust&#8217;s ongoing expenses will be lower than the costs associated with buying and selling gold bullion and storing and insuring gold bullion in a traditional allocated gold bullion account. 

&#8226; Has Minimal Credit Risk . The Shares represent an interest in physical bullion owned by the Trust (other than an amount held in unallocated form which is not sufficient to make up a whole bar or which is held temporarily to effect a creation or redemption of Shares). Physical bullion of the Trust in the Custodian&#8217;s possession is not subject to borrowing arrangements with third parties. Other than the gold temporarily being held in an unallocated gold account with the Custodian, the physical bullion of the Trust is not subject to counterparty or credit risks. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Gold held in the Trust&#8217;s unallocated gold account and any Authorized Participant&#8217;s unallocated gold account is not segregated from the Custodian&#8217;s assets....&#8221; This contrasts with most other financial products that gain exposure to bullion through the use of derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks. 

Investing in the Shares does not insulate the investor from certain risks, including price volatility. See &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;

Overview of the Gold Industry 

Market Participants 

The participants in the world gold market may be classified in the following sectors: the mining and producer sector, the banking sector, the official sector, the investment sector, and the manufacturing sector. A brief description of each follows. 

Mining and Producer Sector. 

This group includes mining companies that specialize in gold and silver production, mining companies that produce gold as a by-product of other production (such as a copper or silver producer), scrap merchants and recyclers. 

Banking Sector 

Gold bullion banks provide a variety of services to the gold market and its participants, thereby facilitating interactions between other parties. Services provided by the gold bullion banking community include traditional banking products as well as mine financing, physical gold purchases and sales, hedging and risk management, inventory management for industrial users and consumers, and gold deposit and loan instruments. 

The Official Sector 

The official sector encompasses the activities of the various central banking operations of gold-holding countries. According to statistics released by the World Gold Council, central banks are estimated to hold approximately 32,000 tonnes (when used in this annual report &#8220;tonne&#8221; refers to one metric tonne, which is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms or 32,151 troy ounces) of gold reserves, or approximately 20% of existing above-ground stocks. Since September 2009, the European Central Bank and 18 other central banks have operated under the Central Bank Gold Agreement (&#8220;CBGA&#8221;). The CBGA maintains a cap on lending and derivatives activities and allows a maximum level of sales of 400 tonnes per year, with an overall total of no more than 2,000 tonnes permitted during the five-year life of the CBGA. 

The Investment Sector 

This sector includes the investment and trading activities of both professional &#38; private investors and speculators. These participants range from large hedge and mutual funds to day-traders on futures exchanges, and retail-level coin collectors. 

The Manufacturing Sector 

The fabrication and manufacturing sector represents all the commercial and industrial users of gold for whom gold is a daily part of their business. The jewelry industry is a large user of gold. Other industrial users of gold include the electronics and dental industries.

The following are some of the main characteristics of the gold market illustrated by the table: 

One factor which separates gold from other precious metals is that there are large above-ground stocks which can be quickly mobilised. As a result of gold&#8217;s liquidity, gold often acts more like a currency than a commodity. 

Over the past ten years, (new) mine production of gold has experienced a modest rise of about &#160; 2 % per annum, increasing 2 % in 2014 . Of the three sources of supply, mine production accounts for nearly 7 2 % of total supply in 2014 . Recycled gold volumes have ranged from 902 tonnes to 1,726 tonnes over the past 10 years. 

On the demand side, jewelry is clearly the greatest source of demand however jewelry&#8217;s contribution to demand has fallen from 94 % in 2005 to 53 % of demand in 2014 . Industrial demand has been relatively constant, contributing between 8 % to 17 % of total demand. 

Exchange traded product inventory build had seen strong growth until 2009, rising approximately three -fold between 2005 and 2009, before tapering and eventually seeing outflows in 2013 &#160; as the price of gold fell by 2 5 % in that year. During the 2013 price crash, retail coin and bar demand rose to a 10-year high as retail investors, especially from China, were enticed by the falling prices. &#160; Exchange traded products continued to see outflows in 2014 and 2015 but the price of gold decline d modestly. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Historical Chart of the Price of Gold 

The price of gold is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements in the price of gold in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including announcements from central banks regarding a country&#8217;s reserve gold holdings, agreements among central banks, political uncertainties around the world, and economic concerns. 

The following chart illustrates the movements in the price of an ounce of gold in US dollars from January 200 6 to January 201 6 : 

&#160; 

The gold price tends to rise during periods of low real interest rates and high monetary expansion, as they are often associated with currency debasement and systemic financial failures. The decline in the US dollar against other currencies, a surge in investment demand in commodities as an asset class generally, and the low level of forward selling by mining companies have all contributed to the increase in the gold price between 2004 and 2011. The gold price peaked at US$1,900/oz in September 2011 as successive Euro leader summits, bailouts and bond stability funds failed to staunch both sovereign debt and banking sector solvency concerns in Europe. Since then, the gold price has been falling as the US dollar has strengthened and real interest rates have increased and the global economy has shown signs of improvement. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Operation of t he Gold Bullion Market 

The global trade in gold consists of Over-the-Counter (OTC) transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options. 

Global Over-The-Counter Market 

The OTC market trades on a 24-hour per day continuous basis and accounts for most global gold trading. 

Market makers, as well as others in the OTC market, trade with each other and with their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. Market makers include the market-making members of the London Bullion Market Association (&#8220; LBMA &#8221;) , the trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in the London bullion market. The fourteen market-making members of the LBMA are: Barclays Bank plc, BNP Paribas SA, Citibank, &#160; Credit Suisse, HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (through its London B ranch), Goldman Sachs International, JPMorgan Chase Bank, Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited, Morgan Stanley &#38; Co. International plc, The Bank of Nova Scotia&#8211;ScotiaMocatta, Soci &#233; t &#233; G &#233; n &#233; rale, Standard Chartered Bank , Toronto-Dominion Bank and UBS AG. The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet clients&#8217; requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place. 

The main centers of the OTC market are London , Zurich and New York. Mining companies, central banks, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these market centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business, typically involving jewelry and &#160; small gold bars (1 kilogram or less) and will hedge their exposure by selling into one of these main OTC centers. Bullion dealers have offices around the world and most of the world&#8217;s major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the LBMA. Of the fourteen &#160; market-making members of the LBMA, six offer clearing services. There are a further 84 full members, plus a number of associate members around the world. The number of LBMA market-making, clearing and full members reported in this annual report are &#160; correct as of the date of this report . These numbers may change from time to time as new members are added and existing members drop out. 

In the OTC market, the standard size of gold trades between market makers ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces. Bid-offer spreads are typically 50 US cents per ounce. Certain dealers are willing to offer clients competitive prices for much larger volumes, including trades over 100,000 ounces, although this will vary according to the dealer, the client and market conditions, as &#160; transaction costs in the OTC market are negotiable between the parties and therefore vary widely. Cost indicators can be obtained from various information service providers as well as dealers. 

Liquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads&#8212;the differential between a dealer&#8217;s &#8220;buy&#8221; and &#8220;sell&#8221; prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the gold market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the COMEX. This period lasts for approximately four hours each New York business day morning. 

The London Bullion Market 

Although the market for physical gold is distributed globally, most OTC market trades are cleared through London. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LBMA acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LBMA is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the &#8220;London Good Delivery Lists,&#8221; which are the lists of LBMA accredited melters and assayers of gold. The LBMA also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation. 

The terms &#8220;loco London&#8221; gold and &#8220;loco Zurich&#8221; gold refer to gold physically held in London and Zurich, respectively, that meets the specifications for weight, dimensions, fineness (or purity), identifying marks (including the assay stamp of a LBMA acceptable refiner) and appearance set forth in &#8220;The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars&#8221; published by the LBMA. Gold bars &#160; meeting these requirements are described in this annual report from time to time as &#8220;London Good Delivery Bars.&#8221; The unit of trade in London is the troy ounce, whose gram conversion is: 1,000 grams equals 32.1507465 troy ounces and 1 troy ounce equals 31.1034768 grams. A London Good Delivery Bar is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market. Typically &#160; referred to as 400-ounce bars, a London Good Delivery Bar must contain between 350 and 430 fine troy ounces of gold, with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%), be of good appearance and be easy to handle and stack. The fine gold content of a gold bar is calculated by multiplying the gross weight of the bar (expressed in units of 0.025 troy ounces) by the fineness of the bar. A London Good Delivery Bar must also bear the stamp of one of the melters and assayers who are on the LBMA approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the gold spot price always refers to that of a London Good Delivery Bar. Business is generally conducted over the phone and through electronic dealing systems. 

&#160;

&#160; 

On March 20, 2015 , ICE Benchmark Administration ( &#8220;IBA&#8221;) began administering the operation of an &#8220;equilibrium auction,&#8221; which is an electronic , tradable and auditable, over-the-counter auction market with the ability to settle trades in U.S. Dollars (&#8220;USD&#8221;), euros or British Pounds for LBMA-authorized participating gold bullion banks or market makers (&#8220;gold participants&#8221;) that establishes a reference gold price for that day&#8217;s trading. IBA&#8217;s equilibrium auction is the gold valuation replacement selected by the LBMA for the London gold fix previously determined by the London Gold Market Fixing Ltd. that was discontinued on March 19, 2015. IBA&#8217;s equilibrium auction, like the previous gold fixing process, establishes and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of gold twice each London trading day during fixing sessions beginning at 10:30 a.m. London time (the LBMA AM Gold Price) and 3:00 p.m. London time (the LBMA PM Gold Price). 

D aily during London trading hours the LBMA AM Gold Price and the LBMA PM Gold Price each provide reference gold prices for that day&#8217;s trading. Many long-term contracts will be priced on either the basis of the LBMA AM Gold Price or the LBMA PM Gold Price, and market participants will usually refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. The LBMA AM Gold Price and the LBMA PM Gold Price, determined according to the methodologies of IBA and disseminated electronically by IBA to selected major market data vendors, such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, are widely used benchmark s for daily gold prices and are quoted by various financial information sources &#160; as the London gold fix was previously. The Trust values its gold on the basis of the LBMA PM Gold Price . 

The LBMA PM Gold Price is the result of an &#8220;equilibrium auction&#8221; because it establishes a price for a troy ounce of gold that clears the maximum amount of bids and offers for gold entered by order-submitting gold participants each day. The opening bid is generated by the auction chairman, who is an employee of IBA; the auction chairman also submits the subsequent opening bids if need be. IBA has indicated that at some point in the future they may switch to an electronic algorithm based method for obtaining opening and subsequent bid prices. There are currently twelve gold participants (Barclays, &#160; Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank USA NA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. London Branch, Morgan Stanley, The Bank of Nova Scotia &#8211; ScotiaMocatta, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered, Toronto-Dominion Bank and UBS), and IBA uses ICE&#8217;s front-end system, WebICE, as the technology platform that allows direct participants as well as sponsored clients to manage their orders in the auction in real time via their own screens. As the IBA electronic gold auction market develops, IBA expects to admit additional gold participants to the order submission process. 

The IBA auction process begins with a notice of an auction round issued to gold participants before the commencement of the auction round stating a gold price in US dollars, determined by the auction chairman, at which the auction round will be conducted. An auction round lasts 30 seconds. Gold participants electronically place bid and offer orders at the round&#8217;s stated price and indicate whether the orders are for their own account or for the account of clients. Aggregate bid and offer volume will be shown live on WebICE, providing a level playing field for all participants. 

At the end of the auction round, the IBA system evaluates the equilibrium of the bid and offer orders submitted. If bid and offer orders indicate an imbalance outside of acceptable tolerances established for the IBA system (20,000 oz) (e.g., too many purchase orders submitted compared to sell orders or vice versa), the auction chairman calculates a new auction round price principally based on the volume weighting of bid and offer orders submitted in the immediately completed auction round. For instance, if the order imbalance indicates that purchase orders (bids) outweigh sales orders (offers) then the auction chairman will issue a new auction round price that will be increased over that used in the prior auction round. Likewise, the auction chairman will decrease the new auction round price from the prior round&#8217;s price if offers outweigh bids. To clear the imbalance, the IBA system then issues another notice of auction round to gold participants at the auction chairman&#8217;s newly calculated price. During this next 30 second auction round, gold participants again submit orders, and after it ends, the IBA system evaluates for order imbalances. If order imbalances persist, the auction chairman calculates a new auction price and a further auction round will occur. This auction round process continues until an equilibrium within specified tolerances is determined to exist. Once the IBA system determines that orders are in equilibrium within system tolerances, the auction process ends and the equilibrium auction round price becomes the LBMA PM Gold Price. 

The LBMA PM Gold Price and all bid and offer order information for all auction rounds become publicly available electronically via IBA instantly after the conclusion of the equilibrium auction. Since April 1, 2015, the LBMA Gold Price has been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) in the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;). IBA also has an Oversight Committee, made up of market participants, industry bodies, direct participant representatives, infrastructure providers and IBA. The Oversight Committee allows the LBMA to continue to have significant involvement in the oversight of the auction process, including, among other matters, changes to the methodology and accreditation of direct participants. Additionally, IBA watches over the price discovery process for the LBMA Gold Price and ensures that it meets the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The LBMA PM Gold Price is widely viewed as a full and fair representation of all or material market interest at the conclusion of the equilibrium auction. IBA&#8217;s LBMA PM Gold Price electronic auction methodology is similar to the non-electronic process previously used to establish the London gold fix where the London gold fix process adjusted the gold price up or down until all the buy and sell orders are matched, at which time the price was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LBMA PM Gold Price has several advantages over the previous London gold fix. The LBMA PM Gold Price auction process is fully transparent in real time to the gold participants and, at the close of each equilibrium auction, to the general public. The LBMA PM Gold Price auction process is also fully auditable by third parties since an audit trail exists from the time of each notice of an auction round. Moreover, the LBMA PM Gold Price&#8217;s audit trail and active, real time surveillance of the auction process by IBA as well as FCA&#8217;s oversight of IBA, will deter manipulative and abusive conduct in establishing each day&#8217;s LBMA PM Gold Price. 

Since March 20, 2015, the Sponsor determined that the London gold fix, which ceased to be published as of March 19, 2015, could no longer serve as a basis for valuing gold bullion received upon purchase of the Trust&#8217;s Shares, delivered upon redemption of the Trust&#8217;s Shares and otherwise held by the Trust on a daily basis, and that the LBMA PM Gold Price is an appropriate alternative for determining the value of the Trust&#8217;s gold each trading day. The Sponsor also determined that the LBMA PM Gold Price will fairly represent the commercial value of gold bullion held by the Trust and the &#8220;Benchmark Price" (as defined in Trust Agreement) as of any day will be the LBMA PM Gold Price for such day. 

The Zurich Bullion Market 

After London, the second principal center for spot or physical gold trading is Zurich. For eight hours a day, trading occurs simultaneously in London and Zurich&#8212;with Zurich normally opening and closing an hour earlier than London. During these hours, Zurich closely rivals London in its influence over the spot price because of the importance of the three major Swiss banks&#8212;Credit &#160; Suisse, Swiss Bank Corporation, and Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS)&#8212;in the physical gold market. Each of these banks has long maintained its own refinery, often taking physical delivery of gold and processing it for other regional markets. The loco Zurich bullion specification is the same as for the London bullion market, which allows for gold physically located in Zurich to be quoted loco London and vice versa. 

Futures Exchanges 

The most significant gold futures exchanges are the COMEX and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange ( &#8220; TOCOM &#8221; ). The COMEX is the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options and has been trading gold since 1974. The TOCOM has been trading gold since 1982. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the gold represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. The COMEX operates through a central clearance system. On June 6, 2003, TOCOM adopted a similar clearance system. In each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes. 

Other Exchanges 

There are other gold exchange markets, such as the Istanbul Gold Exchange (trading gold since 1995), the Shanghai Gold Exchange (trading gold since 2002), the Hong Kong Chinese Gold &#38; Silver Exchange Society (trading gold since 1918) and the Singapore Mercantile Exchange (trading gold since 2010). 

Market Regulation 

The global gold markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition, certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants. In the United Kingdom, responsibility for the regulation of the financial market participants, including the major participating members of the LBMA, falls under the authority of the Financial Conduct Authority ( &#8220; FCA &#8221; ) as provided by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSM Act). Under this act, all UK-based banks, together with other investment firms, are subject to a range of requirements, including fitness and properness, capital adequacy, liquidity, and systems and controls. 

The FCA is responsible for regulating investment products, including derivatives, and those who deal in investment products. Regulation of spot, commercial forwards, and deposits of gold and silver not covered by the FSM Act is provided for by The London Code of Conduct for Non-Investment Products, which was established by market participants in conjunction with the Bank of England. 

The TOCOM has authority to perform financial and operational surveillance on its members&#8217; trading activities, scrutinize positions held by members and large-scale customers, and monitor the price movements of futures markets by comparing them with cash and other derivative markets&#8217; prices. To act as a Futures Commission Merchant Broker on the TOCOM , a broker must obtain a license from Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the regulatory authority that oversees the operations of the TOCOM. 

&#160;

&#160; 

S econdary Market Trading 

While the Trust&#8217;s investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of gold bullion, less the expenses of the Trust, the Shares may trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca at prices that are lower or higher relative to their net asset value (the value of the Trust&#8217;s assets less its liabilities (&#8220;NAV&#8221;)) . The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca and the Commodity Exchange, Inc., a subsidiary of New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (&#8220;COMEX&#8221;), and the London and Zurich bullion markets. While the Shares will trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 PM New York time, liquidity in the global gold market will be reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 PM New York time. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen. 

V aluation of Gold and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On each business day, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m. New York time on such day (the &#8220;Evaluation Time&#8221;), the Trustee evaluates the gold held by the Trust and determines the NAV of the Trust. For the purposes of making these calculations, a business day means any day other than a day when NYSE Arca is closed for regular trading. 

At the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the Trust&#8217;s gold on the basis of that day&#8217;s &#8220; LBMA PM Gold Price&#8221; (the USD price for an ounce of gold set by the LBMA-authorized participating bullion banks or market makers in an electronic, tradable and auditable over-the-counter auction with the ability to participate in three currencies: USD, EUR and GBP, operated by IBA at approximately 3:00PM London time, on each London business day and disseminated electronically by IBA to selected major market data vendors, such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg) . If no LBMA PM Gold Price is made on such day or has not been announced by the Evaluation Time, the next most recent LBMA PM Gold Price determined prior to the Evaluation Time will be used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the LBMA PM Gold Price or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust&#8217;s gold is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust&#8217;s gold, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the LBMA PM Gold Price or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation of the Trust&#8217;s gold or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that such determination is made in good faith. 

Once the value of the gold has been determined, the Trustee will subtract all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets), and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the gold and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust&#8217;s reserve account, if established). The resulting figure is the adjusted net asset value (the &#8220;ANAV&#8221;) of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee. 

All fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets shall be calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day on which the valuation takes place. The Trustee shall subtract from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day). 

The Trustee&#8217;s estimation of accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities is conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those actually paid. 

&#160;

&#160; 

T rust Expenses 

The Trust&#8217;s only ordinary recurring expense is expected to be the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee. In exchange for the Sponsor&#8217;s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee&#8217;s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian&#8217;s fee and reimbursement of the Custodian&#8217;s expenses under the Custody Agreements (defined below), Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to $100,000 per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust&#8217;s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 

The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.39% of the ANAV of the Trust and is payable monthly in arrears. The Sponsor&#8217;s Fee is paid by delivery of gold to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor on an unallocated basis. 

The Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction, may, in its discretion, sell gold in such quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee is authorized to sell gold at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, it being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust&#8217;s holdings of assets other than gold. Accordingly, the amount of gold to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust&#8217;s expenses and the market price of gold. The Custodian is authorized to purchase from the Trust, at the request of the Trustee, gold needed to cover Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor at the price used by the Trustee to determine the value of the gold held by the Trust on the date of the sale. 

Sponsor&#8217;s Fee for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $ 3,444,870 ( December 31, 2014 : $ 4,165,756 ; December 31, 201 3 : $ 5,712,292 ). 

&#160;

&#160; 

D eposit of Gold; Issuance of Shares 

The Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets of 50,000 Shares. Only registered broker-dealers who have entered into written agreements with the Sponsor and the Trustee (each, an &#8220;Authorized Participant&#8221;) can deposit gold and receive Baskets of Shares in exchange. The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of gold represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 

All gold bullion deposited with the Custodian or for the Custodian by the Zurich Sub-Custodian 1 must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of 995 parts per 1,000 (99.5%) and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations practices and customs of the LBMA, including the specifications for a London Good Delivery Bar. 

Creation and redemption orders are accepted on &#8220;business days&#8221; the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. Settlements of such orders requiring receipt or delivery, or confirmation of receipt or delivery, of gold in the United Kingdom, Zurich or another jurisdiction occur on &#8220;business days&#8221; when (1) banks in the United Kingdom, Zurich or such other jurisdiction and (2) the London or Zurich gold markets are regularly open for business. If such banks or the London or Zurich gold markets are not open for regular business for a full day, such a day will only be a &#8220;business day&#8221; for settlement purposes if the settlement procedures can be completed by the end of such day. 

On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to purchase one or more Baskets. Purchase orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. A purchase order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit gold with the Trust, as described below. Prior to the delivery of Baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order (as explained under Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee below). 

An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account, either loco London or loco Zurich, with the required gold deposit amount by the third business day in London or Zurich following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the gold deposit amount, the Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized Participant and the Trustee, will transfer on the third business day following the purchase order date the gold deposit amount from the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account to the unallocated gold account of the Trust established with the Custodian under the Unallocated Account Agreement between the Trustee and the Custodian (the &#8220;Trust Unallocated Account&#8221;) and the Trustee will direct the Depository Trust Company (the &#8220;DTC&#8221;) to credit the number of Baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant&#8217;s DTC account. Acting on standing instructions given by the Trustee, the Custodian will transfer the gold deposit amount from the Trust Unallocated Account to the allocated gold account of the Trust established with the Custodian under the Allocated Account Agreement between the Trustee and the Custodian (the &#8220;Trust Allocated Account&#8221;), by transferring specific gold bars from its inventory or the inventory of the Zurich Sub-Custodian to the Trust Allocated Account. The Trust&#8217;s Unallocated Account Agreement and Allocated Account Agreement are referred to collectively as the &#8220;Custody Agreements.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

1 The Zurich Sub-Custodian is any firm selected by the Custodian to hold the Trust&#8217;s gold in the Trust Allocated Account in the firm&#8217;s Zurich vault premises on a segregated basis and whose appointment has been approved by the Sponsor. The Custodian will use reasonable care in selecting any Zurich Sub-Custodian. As of the date of this annual report, the Zurich Sub-Custodian that the Custodian uses is UBS A.G. , though the Zurich Sub-Custodian currently does not hold any of the Trust&#8217;s gold. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

W ithdrawal of Gold and Redemption of Shares 

The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets and do not entitle an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a &#8220;Shareholder&#8221;) to redeem any Shares in an amount less than a Basket, or to redeem Baskets other than through an Authorized Participant. 

By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC&#8217;s book-entry system to the Trust not later than the third business day following the effective date of the redemption order. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order (as explained under &#8220; Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee &#8221; below). 

The redemption distribution from the Trust will consist of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant&#8217;s Authorized Participant Unallocated Account, either loco London or loco Zurich, representing the amount of the gold held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed. Fractions of a fine ounce of gold included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce are disregarded. Redemption distributions are subject to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges which may be due. 

C reation and Redemption Transaction Fee 

To compensate the Trustee for services in processing the creation and redemption of Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of $500 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsor. The Trustee shall notify DTC of any agreement to change the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of Baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice. The creation and redemption transaction fee payable to the Trustee is in addition to and independent of any gold loco swap cost that an Authorized Participant will be required to pay to the Custodian in connection with a loco London purchase or redemption order. 

T he Sponsor 

The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company. The Sponsor&#8217;s office is located at Ordnance House, 31 Pier Road, St. Helier, Jersey JE4 8PW, Channel Islands.

The Sponsor&#8217;s Role &#160; 

The Sponsor arranged for the creation of the Trust, the registration of the Shares for their public offering in the United States and the listing of the Shares on the NYSE Arca. The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee&#8217;s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian&#8217;s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian&#8217;s expenses under the Custody Agreements, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to $100,000 per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust&#8217;s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 

The Sponsor does not exercise day-to-day oversight over the Trustee or the Custodian. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee (i) if the Trustee ceases to meet certain objective requirements (including the requirement that it have capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $150 million), (ii) if, having received written notice of a material breach of its obligations under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee has not cured the breach within 30 days, or (iii) if the Trustee refuses to consent to the implementation of an amendment to the Trust&#8217;s initial Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Sponsor also has the right to replace the Trustee during the 90 days following any merger, consolidation or conversion in which the Trustee is not the surviving entity or, in its discretion, on the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Trust or on any subsequent third anniversary thereafter. The Sponsor also has the right to approve any new or additional custodian that the Trustee may wish to appoint and any new or additional Zurich Sub-Custodian that the Custodian may wish to appoint. 

The Sponsor or one of its affiliates or agents (1) develops a marketing plan for the Trust on an ongoing basis, (2) prepares marketing materials regarding the Shares, including the content of the Trust&#8217;s website and (3) executes the marketing plan for the Trust.

T he Custodian 

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (&#8220;JPMorgan&#8221;) serves as the Custodian of the Trust&#8217;s gold. JPMorgan is a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States of America. JPMorgan is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. JPMorgan&#8217;s London office is regulated by the FCA &#160; and is located at 25 Bank Street, London, E14 5JP, United Kingdom. JPMorgan is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. While the U nited K ingdom operations of the Custodian are regulated by the FCA, the custodial services provided by the Custodian and any sub-custodian, including the Zurich Sub-Custodian under the Custody Agreement, are presently not a regulated activity subject to the supervision and rules of the FCA. &#160; 

The Custodian&#8217;s Role &#160; 

The Custodian is responsible for safekeeping of the Trust &#8217;s gold deposited with it by Authorized Participants in connection with the creation of Baskets. The Custodian is also responsible for selecting the Zurich Sub-Custodian and its other sub-custodians, if any. The Custodian facilitates the transfer of gold in and out of the Trust through the unallocated gold accounts it will maintain for each Authorized Participant and the unallocated and allocated gold accounts it will maintain for the Trust. The Custodian holds the Trust&#8217;s allocated gold at its Zurich, Switzerland vault premises . The Custodian is responsible for allocating specific bars of gold bullion to the Trust Allocated Account. The Custodian provides the Trustee with regular reports detailing the gold transfers in and out of the Trust&#8217;s unallocated and allocated gold accounts and identifying the gold bars held in the Trust&#8217;s allocated gold account. 

The Custodian&#8217;s fees and expenses under the Custody Agreements are paid by the Sponsor. 

The Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell gold or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Inspectio n of Gold 

Under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Sponsor&#8217;s auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit the premises of the Custodian or the Zurich Sub-Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust&#8217;s gold and certain related records maintained by the Custodian. &#160; Any such inspection rights with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian are expected to be granted in accordance with the normal course of dealing between the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. Visits by auditors and inspectors to the Zurich Sub-Custodian&#8217;s facilities will be arranged through the Custodian . O ther than with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the Trustee and the Sponsor have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes of examining the Trust&#8217;s gold or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no sub-custodian is obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee or the Sponsor may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such sub-custodian. 

The Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian in order to examine the gold and the records maintained by them. The most recent inspection by Inspectorate International Limited, a leading commodity inspection and testing company retained by the Sponsor, of the Custodian wa s conducted on December 31, 2015 . &#160; On January 29, 2015 all gold held by the Zurich Sub-Custodian was transferred to the Custodian. As no gold is currently held by the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the last inspection was conducted on December 31, 2014. 

D escription of the Shares 

General &#160; 

The Trustee is authorized under the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Trustee creates Shares only in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 50,000 Shares) and only upon the order of an Authorized Participant. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance of Shares above the amount registered on the Trust&#8217;s then-current and effective registration statement with the SEC will require the registration of such additional Shares. 

Description of Limited Rights &#160; 

The Shares do not represent a traditional investment and you should not view them as similar to &#8220;shares&#8221; of a corporation operating a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. Shareholders do not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring &#8220;oppression&#8221; or &#8220;derivative&#8221; actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights to distributions. 

Distributions &#160; 

If the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution. 

Voting and Approvals &#160; 

Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. The Trustee may terminate the Trust upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 75% of the outstanding Shares. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Agreement require advance notice to the Shareholders before the effectiveness of such amendments, but no Shareholder vote or approval is required for any amendment to the Trust Agreement. 

Redemption of the Shares &#160; 

The Shares may only be redeemed by or through an Authorized Participant and only in Baskets. 

Book-Entry Form &#160; 

Individual certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, one or more global certificates is deposited by the Trustee with DTC and registered in the name of Cede &#38; Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time. Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (DTC Participants), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (Indirect Participants), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares. Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry practice. 

&#160;

&#160; 

C ustody of the Trust&#8217;s Gold 

Custody of the gold bullion deposited with and held by the Trust is provided by the Custodian at the Zurich, Switzerland vaults of the Custodian and/or the Zurich Sub-Custodian, and by other sub-custodians on a temporary basis only in unallocated form. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LBMA. 

The Custodian is the custodian of the gold bullion credited to Trust Allocated Account in accordance with the Custody Agreements. The Custodian segregates the gold bullion credited to the Trust Allocated Account from any other precious metal it holds or holds for others by entering appropriate entries in its books and records, and requires any Zurich Sub-Custodian it appoints to also segregate the gold bullion from the other gold held by them for other customers of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodians&#8217; other customers. The Custodian requires any Zurich Sub-Custodian it appoints to identify in such Zurich Sub-Custodian&#8217;s books and records the Trust as having the rights to the gold bullion credited to its Trust Allocated Account. Under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Sponsor&#8217;s auditors and inspectors may inspect the vaults of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian. See &#8220;Inspection of Gold&#8221;. 

The Custodian, as instructed by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, is authorized to accept, on behalf of the Trust, deposits of gold in unallocated form. Acting on standing instructions given by the Trustee specified in the Custody Agreements, the Custodian allocates or requires the Zurich Sub-Custodian to allocate gold deposited in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting bars of gold bullion for deposit to the Trust Allocated Account. All gold bullion allocated to the Trust must conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LBMA. 

The process of withdrawing gold from the Trust for a redemption of a Basket follows the same general procedure as for depositing gold with the Trust for a creation of a Basket, only in reverse. Each transfer of gold between the Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account connected with a creation or redemption of a Basket may result in a small amount of gold being held in the Trust Unallocated Account after the completion of the transfer. In making deposits and withdrawals between the Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account, the Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of gold held in the Trust Unallocated Account as of the close of each business day. &#160; See "Creation and Redemption of Shares." 

&#160;

&#160; 

U nited States Federal Income Tax Consequences 

The following is a discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences that generally apply to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Shares by a US Shareholder (as defined below), and certain US federal income tax consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares by a Non-US Shareholder (as defined below). The discussion is based on the United States Internal Revenue code of 1986 as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). The discussion below is based on the Code , United States Treasury Regulations (&#8220;Treasury Regulations&#8221;) promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this annual report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders, banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, Shareholders whose functional currency is not the US dollar or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not discussed below. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as &#8220;capital assets&#8221; within the meaning of Code section 1221 and not as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or a conversion or constructive sale transaction. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law or any transfer tax on an owner of Shares. Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all federal, state, local and foreign tax law or any transfer tax considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares. 

For purposes of this discussion, a &#8220;US Shareholder&#8221; is a Shareholder that is: 

&#8226; An individual who is treated as a citizen or resident of the United States; 

&#8226; A corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; 

&#8226; An estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or 

&#8226; A trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 

A Shareholder that is not a US Shareholder as defined above (other than a partnership, or an entity treated as a partnership for US federal tax purposes) generally is considered a &#8220;Non-US Shareholder&#8221; for purposes of this discussion. For US federal income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes, generally depends upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the US federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares. 

Taxation of the Trust &#160; 

The Trust is classified as a &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself is not subject to US federal income tax. Instead, the Trust&#8217;s income and expenses &#8220;flow through&#8221; to the Shareholders, and the Trustee reports the Trust&#8217;s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) on that basis. 

Taxation of US Shareholders &#160; 

Shareholders generally are treated, for US federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held by the Trust. Shareholders are also treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata shares of the Trust&#8217;s income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata shares of the Trust&#8217;s expenses. In the case of a Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held by the Trust at the time it acquires its Shares is equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires its Shares as part of a creation of a Basket , the delivery of gold to the Trust in exchange for the Shares is not a taxable event to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis and holding period for the Shares are the same as its tax basis and holding period for the gold delivered in exchange therefore (except to the extent of any cash contributed for such Shares). For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder&#8217;s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their tax advisors . &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

When the Trust sells or transfers gold, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the Shareholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale or transfer and (2) the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold that was sold or transferred . &#160; Such gain or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the Shareholder has a holding period in its Shares of longer than one year. A Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for its share of any gold sold by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the Shareholder&#8217;s total basis for its Shares immediately prior to the sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of gold sold, and the denominator of which is the total amount of the gold held by the Trust immediately prior to the sale. After any such sale, a Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for its pro rata share of the gold remaining in the Trust will be equal to its tax basis for its Shares immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the gold that was sold. 

Upon a Shareholder&#8217;s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold a pro rata share of the gold held in the Trust at the time of the sale. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (2) the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. 

A redemption of some or all of a Shareholder&#8217;s Shares in exchange for the underlying gold represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for the gold received in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis for the Shares redeemed. The Shareholder&#8217;s holding period with respect to the gold received should include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the gold received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event. 

An Authorized Participant and other investors may be able to re-invest, on a tax-deferred basis, in-kind redemption proceeds received from exchange-traded products that are substantially similar to the Trust in the Trust&#8217;s Shares. Authorized Participants and other investors should consult their tax advisors as to whether and under what circumstances the reinvestment in the Shares of proceeds from substantially similar exchange-traded products can be accomplished on a tax-deferred basis. 

Under current law, gains recognized by individuals , estates or trusts from the sale of &#8220;collectibles,&#8221; including gold bullion, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum federal income tax rate of 28%, rather than the 20% rate applicable to most other long-term capital gains. For these purposes, gain recognized by an individual upon the sale of Shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the Trust&#8217;s sale of any gold bullion which the Shareholder is treated (through its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28%. The tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual US Shareholder for one year or less or by a corporate taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. 

In addition, high-income individuals and certain trusts and estates, are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax that is imposed on net investment income and gain. Shareholders should consult their tax advisor regarding this tax 

Brokerage Fees and Trust Expenses &#160; 

Any brokerage or other transaction fee incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares is treated as part of the Shareholder&#8217;s tax basis in the Shares . Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares reduces the amount realized by the Shareholder with respect to the sale. 

Shareholders will be required to recognize gain or loss up on a sale of gold by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata share of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust, to the extent that such expenses may be deducted, as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Individuals may deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions only to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. In addition, such deductions may be subject to further limitations under applicable provisions of the Code, and are not deductible at all for alternative minimum tax purposes.

Investment by Regulated Investment Companies &#160; 

Mutual funds and other investment vehicles which are &#8220;regulated investment companies&#8221; within the meaning of Code section 851 should consult with their tax advisors concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although they are a &#8220;security&#8221; within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be considered an investment in the underlying gold for purposes of Code section 851(b), and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation of their qualification under Code section 851. 

United States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding for US and Non-US Shareholders &#160; 

The Trustee or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provides certain tax-related information to Shareholders, in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of the Trust&#8217;s annual income (if any) and expenses. 

A US Shareholder may be subject to US backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-US Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not US person s in order to avoid the backup withholding tax. 

The amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder&#8217;s US federal income tax liability and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. 

Income Taxation of Non-US Shareholders &#160; 

The Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gain (if any) upon the sale of gold. A Non-US Shareholder generally is not subject to US federal income tax with respect to gain recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of gold by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-US Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-US Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States. 

Taxation in Jurisdictions other than the United States &#160; 

Prospective purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction, of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular, as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale, redemption or other dealing.

E RISA and Related Considerations 

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements on certain employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans, and certain commingled investment vehicles or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested (collectively, &#8220;Plans&#8221;), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of &#8220;plan assets&#8221; of a Plan. Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under other federal law, or under state or local law (&#8220;Other Law&#8221;). 

In contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan and the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; discussed above and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA or Other Law, including, but not limited to: (1) whether the investment is permitted under the P lan&#8217;s governing documents, (2) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment, (3) whether the investment is consistent with the P lan&#8217;s funding objectives, (4) the tax effects of the investment on the Plan, and (5) whether the investment is prudent considering the factors discussed in this report. In addition, ERISA and Code section 4975 prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a plan and persons who are &#8220;parties in interest&#8221; under ERISA or &#8220;disqualified persons&#8221; under section 4975 of the Code. A violation of these rules may result in the imposition of significant excise taxes and other liabilities. Plans subject to Other Law may be subject to similar restrictions. 

It is anticipated that the Shares will constitute &#8220;publicly-held offered securities&#8221; as defined in the Department of Labor &#8220;Plan Asset Regulations,&#8221; &#167;2510.3-101 (b)(2) as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA. Accordingly, pursuant to the Plan Asset Regulations, Shares purchased by a Plan, and not an interest in the underlying assets held in the Trust, should be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying the &#8220;fiduciary responsibility&#8221; rules of ERISA and the &#8220;prohibited transaction&#8221; rules of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of plans subject to Other Law should consult legal counsel to determine whether there would be a similar result under the Other Law. 

Investment by Certain Retirement Plans &#160; 

Code section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a &#8220;collectible&#8221; by an individual retirement account (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Code section 401(a) is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom the plan account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible. The term &#8220;collectible&#8221; is defined to include, with certain exceptions, &#8220;any metal or gem&#8221;. The IRS has issued several private letter rulings to the effect that a purchase by an IRA, or by a participant-directed account under a Code section 401(a) plan, of publicly-traded Shares in a trust holding precious metals will not be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution to the IRA owner or plan participant under Code section 408(m). However the private letter rulings provide that, if any of the Shares so purchased are distributed from the IRA or plan account to the IRA owner or plan participant, or if any precious metal is received by such IRA or plan account upon the redemption of any of the Shares purchased by it, the Shares or precious metal so distributed will be subject to federal income tax in the year of distribution, to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of Code sections 408(d), 408(m) or 402.
