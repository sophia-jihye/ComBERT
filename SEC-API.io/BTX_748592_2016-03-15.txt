About Our Business and How We Talk About It 

&#160; 

We deliver interactive entertainment and innovative dining technology to bars and restaurants in North America. Our customers license our customizable solution to differentiate themselves via competitive fun by offering guests trivia, card, sports and arcade games, nationwide competitions, and self-service dining features including dynamic menus, touchscreen ordering and secure payment. Our platform can improve operating efficiencies, create connections among the players and venues and amplify guests&#8217; positive experiences. Built on an extended network platform, our interactive entertainment system has historically allowed multiple players to interact at the venue, and now also enables competition between venues, referred to as massively multiplayer gaming. Our current tablet platform, which we refer to as Buzztime Entertainment On Demand, or BEOND, was first introduced as a pilot program in December 2012, was expanded commercially during 2013, and the expansion was scaled during 2014. We continue to enhance our network architecture and the BEOND technology platform and player engagement paradigms. We also continue to support our legacy network product line, which we refer to as Classic. 

&#160; 

We currently generate revenue by charging subscription fees for our service to our network subscribers, by leasing equipment (including tablets used in our BEOND tablet platform and the cases and charging trays for the tablets) to certain network subscribers, by hosting live trivia events, and by selling advertising aired on in-venue screens and as part of customized games. In 2014, we began offering pay-to-play premium content to certain customers via our BEOND tablet platform, such as paid arcade. During the second quarter of 2015, we made a strategic change in our premium content model by making the arcade offering available on both a free-to-consumer and pay-to-play basis. This change required us to delay the general availability of the pay-to-play arcade offering as we retooled its content, workflow and positioning. As a result, during 2015, we generated additional subscription fee revenue from those venues offering free-to-consumer arcade. We anticipate rolling out the new pay-to-play arcade offering during the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

Over 115 million games were played on our network during 2015. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, our mobile application has been installed on over 1.5 million consumer mobile devices. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 48% of our network subscriber venues are affiliated with national and regional restaurant brands, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Old Chicago, Beef O&#8217;Brady&#8217;s, Buffalo Wings &#38; Rings, Native New Yorker, Houlihans, Boston Pizza, and Arooga&#8217;s. 

&#160; 

We own several trademarks and consider the Buzztime&#174;, Playmaker&#174;, Mobile Playmaker, BEOND Powered by Buzztime and Play Along trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. These and our other registered and unregistered trademarks used in this document are our property. Other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Notice of non-compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standard 

&#160; 

As previously reported, in November 2015, we received a letter from the NYSE Regulation Inc. stating that we are not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide because we reported stockholders&#8217; equity of less than $6 million as of September 30, 2015 and had net losses in five of our most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2014. In December 2015, we submitted a plan to NYSE Regulation advising of actions we have taken or will take to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) by May 13, 2017. In January 2016, NYSE Regulation notified us that it has accepted our plan and granted us a plan period that extends through May 13, 2017 to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii). The listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT is being continued during the plan period pursuant to an extension. The NYSE Regulation staff will review us periodically for compliance with initiatives outlined in our plan. If we are not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) by May 13, 2017 or if we do not make progress consistent with our plan during the plan period, NYSE Regulation staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate. See &#8220;ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS&#8212;Risks Relating to the Market for Our Common Stock&#8212;Our common stock could be delisted or suspended from trading on the NYSE MKT if we fail to maintain compliance with continued listing criteria,&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

East West Bank Credit Facility 

&#160; 

In April 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with East West Bank, or the lender, pursuant to which, we could request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount at any time up to the lesser of $7,500,000, which we refer to as the revolving line, or an amount equal to our borrowing base, in each case, less the aggregate outstanding principal amount of prior advances. In March 2016, we entered into an amendment (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) to the loan and security agreement. The loan and security agreement as amended by the Amendment is referred to as the &#8220;Amended Loan Agreement.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Under the Amended Loan Agreement, through March 31, 2017, we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount at any time up to the lesser of (a) the revolving line or (b) the sum of $2,000,000 (which we refer to as the &#8220;sublimit&#8221;) plus the amount equal to our borrowing base, in each case, less the aggregate outstanding principal amount of prior advances. On March 31, 2017, the sublimit becomes zero. If the aggregate amount of advances as of March 31, 2017 exceeds the lesser of the revolving line or the amount equal to our borrowing base, then we must pay the lender the amount of such excess. 

&#160; 

Other changes to the original terms of the loan and security agreement made under the Amendment are: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Under the original terms of the loan and security agreement, our borrowing base was, as of the date of determination, an amount equal to the product of: (a) the average monthly recurring revenue for the immediately preceding three months; times (b) one plus our average churn rate for the immediately preceding three months (not to exceed zero); times (c) 300%. The manner in which our borrowing base is determined is unchanged under the Amendment, except that our monthly recurring revenue is limited to all recurring subscription revenue attributable to software that we sold or licensed and all recurring revenue relating to services we delivered and 50% of all revenue attributable to our &#8220;Stump&#8221; product line. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; All advances under the revolving line are due on December 31, 2017 as opposed to April 14, 2018 as was the case under the original terms. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; On or before March 31, 2017, advances will bear interest, at our option, at the rate of either (A) a variable rate per annum equal to the prime rate as set forth in The Wall Street Journal plus 2.75%, up from 1.25% under the original terms, or (B) at a fixed rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for the interest period for the advance plus 5.50%, up from 4.00% under the original terms. After March 31, 2017, the interest rates will revert to their original terms. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Our financial covenants with respect to our minimum adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, changed from a six-month measurement period to a three-month measurement period, beginning with the three month period ending March 31, 2016, and, accordingly, the minimum adjusted EBITDA targets we are required to achieve over each of the three month measurement periods were changed. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The Amendment provides for two additional financial covenants: (a) that we maintain a balance on deposit with the lender equal to (i) on March 31, 2017, 100% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances at such time, and (ii) at all times after March 31, 2017, an amount determined by the lender based on our 2017 financial projections; and (b) that the sum of the following be not less than $2,000,000: (i) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash that we hold in accounts maintained with the lender and (ii) the amount available to us under the Amended Loan Agreement. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The aggregate amount that we owe under our current credit facility with our equipment lender at any time is no longer limited to $2,500,000. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; With the lender&#8217;s consent, we may incur additional indebtedness with other equipment lenders of up to $2,000,000 in the aggregate for equipment financing. &#160; 

Under the Amendment, the lender also waived an event of default that occurred because we did not achieve the specified churn rate required under the loan and security agreement for the month ended January 31, 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

We have historically operated under a subscription-based model where our primary source of revenue was monthly subscription fees from network subscribers. Although we expect that subscription fees will remain our primary source of revenue, we believe there are other transactional consumer revenue streams that could grow as a result of our investment in the BEOND tablet platform, such as revenue generated directly from consumers who pay to play or use our premium content. Our strategy for achieving revenue growth includes the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Scale digital menu and payment functionality. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 61% of our total sites, including 100% of Buffalo Wild Wing sites, were on our BEOND tablet platform, compared to 37% of our total sites at the end of 2014. Having achieved this scale of BEOND tablet platform sites, we can now focus more heavily on delivering digital menu and payment functionality on the tablet platform, which is designed to improve the operational and marketing value of our product offering. During 2015, we continued testing our digital menu functionality and added payment functionality at some of the locations of one of our chain customers, Arooga&#8217;s Grill House and Sports Bar. Now that we have all of the Buffalo Wild Wings locations on our BEOND tablet platform, we can focus on providing this same functionality in a pilot test with Buffalo Wild Wings during 2016, which should help provide a national reference for other chain customers in our sales pipeline that are also looking for digital menu and payment functionality. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Improve value and price for our &#8220;independent&#8221; customers. We are focused on increasing the value of our offering by improving game content and reducing the BEOND tablet platform cost to attract and retain quality independent customers. We have made significant strides in both of these areas during 2015: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Game Content &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Jackpot Trivia, which we released in the second quarter of 2015, is the number one played trivia game in our network. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Buzztime Sports, which is a football trivia game that we launched in the third quarter of 2015, allowed us to better understand how to drive play into our customer sites and how to better integrate social promotions. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Sponsored Content, like Academy of Football, which was a branded game centered around college football and sponsored by both MillerCoors and Dr. Pepper, was launched during the fourth quarter of 2015 in participating locations across the country, and drove an 8% increase in sales for Dr. Pepper across those locations. &#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We believe the improved gaming content is more engaging and is an improved entertainment experience. As of December 31, 2015, we had over nine million player registrations, up from seven million at the end of 2014; tablet sessions increased approximately 80% from 11.5 million in 2014 to 20.8 million in 2015; and total games played increased approximately 40% from approximately 80 million in 2014 to approximately 115 million in 2015. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The new gaming platform and the sponsorships have fostered new relationships. For example, during 2015 we began relationships with FanDuel and with the Washington Redskins. We will be testing a number of initiatives with FanDuel throughout 2016, such as special FanDuel tournaments with prizes just for our players, and plan to leverage Jackpot Trivia to create a Redskins sponsored edition that players in the Washington D.C. market can play to earn points and win experiential Redskins related prizes throughout several trivia seasons in 2016. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; BEOND tablet platform costs. As previously reported, during 2015, we experienced problems with our in-house designed and manufactured second generation BEOND tablet platform equipment, which resulted in significant repair expense and write-offs of obsolete components during 2015. We have since outsourced the design and manufacturing of our third generation BEOND tablet platform equipment to an unaffiliated third party, and have seen a reduction in its cost. During 2016, we will continue focusing on further reducing the cost for other components of the tablet platform. &#160; 

&#160; &#160; With improvements to the game content and a reduction in the equipment costs described above, we believe we will be able to offer flexibility in our pricing for quality independent customers, which should help us attract and retain more of them. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Monetize the network. We intend to grow the consumer audience by engaging them more with improved entertainment experiences and providing premium content that we can monetize through direct payment. In 2014, we began offering pay-to-play premium content to certain customers via our BEOND tablet platform, such as paid arcade. During the second quarter of 2015, we made a strategic change in our premium content model by making the arcade offering available on both a free-to-consumer and pay-to-play basis. This change required us to delay the general availability of the pay-to-play arcade offering as we retooled its content, workflow and positioning. We believe that we will be able to command higher prices from our customers who want to offer the premium content on a free-to-consumer basis to their patrons, thereby increasing our subscription revenue, and that we will be able to recognize accretive revenue directly from consumers who play the arcade offering on a pay-to-play basis. &#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face direct competition in venues and face competition for total entertainment and marketing dollars in the marketplace from other companies offering similar content and services. A relatively small number of direct competitors are active in the hospitality marketing services and entertainment markets, including Ziosk, E la Carte, Inc. and Touchtunes Interactive Networks. Competing forms of technology, entertainment, and marketing available in hospitality venues include on-table bar and restaurant entertainment systems, music and video-based systems, live entertainment and games, cable, satellite and pay-per-view programming, coin-operated single-player games/amusements, and traffic-building promotions like happy hour specials and buffets. 

&#160; 

In addition, we are increasingly competing with games, apps and other forms of entertainment offerings available directly to consumers on their smart phones and tablets. 

&#160; 

Buzztime Significant Customer 

&#160; 

Our customers range from small independently operated bars and restaurants to bars and restaurants operated by national chains. This results in diverse venue sizes and locations. As of December 31, 2015, 2,960 venues in the U.S. and Canada subscribed to our interactive entertainment network, of which, approximately one-third were Buffalo Wild Wings corporate-owned restaurants and its franchisees (collectively, &#8220;Buffalo Wild Wings&#8221;). For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, revenue generated from Buffalo Wild Wings was as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Buffalo Wild Wings revenue &#160; $ 10,889,000 &#160; &#160; $ 11,438,000 &#160; Percent of total revenue &#160; &#160; 44 % &#160; &#160; 44 % &#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, amounts included in accounts receivable from Buffalo Wild Wings was as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Buffalo Wild Wings accounts receivable &#160; $ 172,000 &#160; &#160; $ 1,558,000 &#160; &#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

We historically have not had a significant backlog at any time because we have been able to deliver and install new systems at venues within a 30 day period. During 2014, we encountered challenges with the assembly of the cases for our BEOND tablet, which prevented us from delivering and installing new systems within the 30 day period, thereby creating a backlog. As of December 31, 2014, customer agreements worth approximately $1,416,000 were affected by the backlog. We determined the worth of such agreements based on the sum of the annualized amount of the subscription fees, which is recognized as revenue as the service is provided, and the amount of equipment lease revenue, if any, subject to such agreements, which is recognized as revenue upon installation of the equipment leased. During 2015, we resolved the case assembly issue, and as a result, we currently do not have any significant backlog. 

&#160; 

Licensing, Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents 

&#160; 

Our intellectual property assets, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights, are important to our business and, accordingly, we have programs in place designed to protect these assets. 

&#160; 

We keep confidential as trade secrets our technology, know-how and software. Some of the hardware we use in our operations is customized, and all of it is purchased from outside vendors. We enter into agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business, which contain provisions designed to protect our intellectual property and to limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors. 

&#160; 

We have trademark protection for the names of our key proprietary programming, products, and services to the extent that we believe trademark protection is appropriate. We are expanding our efforts to protect these investments. We consider the Buzztime, Playmaker, Mobile Playmaker, BEOND Powered by Buzztime, PlayersPlus, and Play Along trademarks and our other related trademarks to be valuable assets, and we seek to protect them through a variety of actions. Our content, branding, and some of our game titles, such as Countdown, SIX, and Showdown are also protected by copyright and trademark law. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Government Contracts 

&#160; 

We provide our content distribution services through the Buzztime network to colleges, universities, and a small number of government agencies, typically military base recreation units. However, the number of government customers is small compared to our overall customer base. We provide our products and services to government agencies under contracts with substantially the same terms and conditions as are in place with non-government customers. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

The cost of compliance with federal, state, and local laws has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date. In December 2012, we received approval from the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, for our BEOND tablet charging trays, and in September 2015, we received FCC approval for our third generation BEOND tablet cases with and without payment electronics. The BEOND tablets we currently use have been certified by its manufacturer. 

&#160; 

In addition to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply directly to the interactive entertainment and product marketing industries. Additionally, state and federal governments may adopt additional laws and regulations that address issues related to certain aspects of our business such as: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; user privacy; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; copyrights; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; gaming, lottery and alcohol beverage control regulations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; consumer protection; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the distribution of specific material or content; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the characteristics and quality of interactive entertainment products and services. &#160; 

As part of our service, we operate games of chance and games of skill. These games are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions. Our games are played just for fun and winner recognition. None of our games award anything of value to winners. Included in our offering are a number of interactive card games, such as Texas Hold&#8217;em poker. These card games are restricted in certain jurisdictions. The laws and regulations that govern these games, however, vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to legislative and regulatory change, as well as law enforcement discretion. We may find it necessary to eliminate, modify, or cancel certain components of our products in certain states or jurisdictions based on changes in law, regulations and law enforcement discretion, which could result in additional development costs and/or the possible loss of customers and revenue. 

&#160; 

Web Site Access to SEC Filings 

&#160; 

Our annual reports on F orm 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, and proxy statements and other information we file or furnish pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available on our website at www.buzztime.com/business/investor-relations/ under the heading SEC Filings as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC. In addition, we make available on that same website under the heading Corporate Governance our (i) our code of conduct and ethics; (ii) our corporate governance guidelines; and (iii) the charter of each active committee of our board of directors. We intend to disclose any amendment to, or a waiver from, a provision of our code of conduct and ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions and that relates to any element of the code of ethics definition enumerated in paragraph (b) of Item 406 of Regulation S-K by posting such information on that website. 

&#160; 

Materials we file with the SEC may also be read and copied at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our company that we file electronically with the SEC. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 4, 2016, we employed approximately 106 people on a full-time basis and 251 people on a part-time basis. We also utilize independent contractors for specific projects. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are satisfactory. 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History 

&#160; 

NTN Buzztime, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as Alroy Industries and changed its corporate name to NTN Communications, Inc. in 1985. The name was changed to NTN Buzztime, Inc. in 2005 to better reflect the growing role of the Buzztime consumer brand.
