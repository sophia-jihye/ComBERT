 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

Relmada Therapeutics is a clinical-stage, publicly traded biotechnology company developing new chemical entities (NCEs) together with novel versions of proven drug products that potentially address areas of high unmet medical need in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases - primarily depression and chronic pain. The Company has a diversified portfolio of four products at various stages of development, including d-Methadone (dextromethadone, REL-1017), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist for treating depression and neuropathic pain; LevoCap ER (REL-1015), an abuse resistant, sustained release dosage form of the opioid analgesic levorphanol; BuTab (oral buprenorphine, REL-1028), an oral dosage form of the opioid analgesic buprenorphine; and MepiGel (topical mepivacaine, REL-1021), an orphan drug designated topical formulation of the local anesthetic mepivacaine.

&#160;

Our lead product candidate, d-Methadone, is a NCE being developed as a rapidly acting, oral agent for the treatment of depression, neuropathic pain, and/or other potential CNS pathological conditions. We have completed Phase I single and multiple ascending dose studies and have confirmed safety, tolerability, and dose range for a planned Phase II study in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

&#160;

In addition to the clinical development of d-Methadone, we are focused on advancing three additional products combining proven drug candidates with novel delivery methods to create new drugs and/or indications through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Product development plans for several of our products, such as LevoCap ER and BuTab, require the completion of a relatively small Phase I program before entering Phase III pivotal clinical trials using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.

&#160;

We believe that our CNS-centric pipeline is diversified by mechanism of action, development stage, and regulatory strategy, which mitigates risk while offering significant upside. Our highly experienced drug development leadership and world-class scientific and business advisors provide the expertise to efficiently advance product development.

&#160;

Our four development projects are briefly described below:

&#160;

d-Methadone (dextromethadone, REL-1017) 

&#160;

Background 

&#160;

In 2014, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimated that 15.7 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. According to data from nationally representative surveys supported by NIMH, only about half of Americans diagnosed with major depression in a given year receive treatment. Of those receiving treatment with as many as four different standard antidepressants, 33% of drug-treated depression patients do not achieve adequate therapeutic benefits according to the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial published in the American Journal of Psychiatry . Accordingly, we believe that approximately 3 million patients with such treatment-resistant depression are in need of new treatment options.

&#160;

In addition to the high failure rate, none of the marketed products for depression can demonstrate rapid antidepressant effects and most of the products take up to a month to show effectiveness. The urgent need for improved, faster acting antidepressant treatments is underscored by the fact that severe depression can be life-threatening, due to heightened risk of suicide.

&#160;

Recent studies have shown that ketamine, a drug known previously as an anesthetic, can lift depression in many patients within hours. However, it is unlikely that ketamine itself will become a practical treatment for most cases of depression. It must be administered through intravenous infusion, requiring a hospital setting, and more importantly can potentially trigger adverse side effects including psychedelic symptoms (hallucinations, memory defects, panic attacks), nausea/vomiting, somnolence, cardiovascular stimulation and, in a minority of patients, hepatoxicity. Ketamine also hasn&#8217;t been thoroughly studied for long-term safety and effectiveness, and the FDA hasn&#8217;t approved it to treat depression.

&#160;

d-Methadone Overview and Mechanism of Action 

&#160;

d-Methadone&#8217;s mechanism of action, as a non-competitive NMDA channel blocker or antagonist, is fundamentally differentiated from all currently FDA-approved antidepressants, as well as all atypical antipsychotics used adjunctively with standard, FDA-approved antidepressants. Working through the same brain mechanisms as ketamine but potentially lacking its adverse side effects, Relmada&#8217;s d-Methadone is being developed as a rapidly acting, oral agent for the treatment of depression, neuropathic pain, and/or other potential CNS pathological conditions.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In chemistry an enantiomer, also known as an optical isomer, is one of two stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable (not identical), much as one&#8217;s left and right hands are the same except for being reversed along one axis. A racemic compound, or racemate, is one that has equal amounts of left- and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule. For racemic drugs, often only one of a drug&#8217;s enantiomers is responsible for the desired physiologic effects, while the other enantiomer is less active or inactive.

&#160;

Racemic methadone has been used since the 1950s as a treatment for opioid addiction and has remained the primary therapy for this condition for more than 40 years. Recently, methadone has been used to manage cancer pain and other chronic pain states. Methadone is a highly lipophilic molecule that is suitable for a variety of administration routes, with oral bioavailability close to 80% compared with 26% for morphine.

&#160;

As a single isomer of racemic methadone, d-Methadone has been shown to possess NMDA antagonist properties with virtually no traditional opioid or ketamine-like adverse events at the expected therapeutic doses. In contrast, racemic methadone is associated with common opioid side effects that include anxiety, nervousness, restlessness, sleep problems (insomnia), nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, drowsiness, and others. It has been shown that the left (levo) isomer, l-Methadone, is largely responsible for methadone&#8217;s opioid activity, while the right (dextro) isomer, d-Methadone, is much less active as an opioid while maintaining affinity for the NMDA receptor.

&#160;

NMDA receptors are present in many parts of the central nervous system and play important roles in neuronal plasticity and other functions that are important for cognitive functions such as learning and memory. They also contribute to the maladaptive plasticity, which results in neuropathic pain. Based on these premises, d-Methadone is potentially a platform that could be developed and could show benefits in several different indications.

&#160;

d-Methadone Phase 1 Clinical Safety Studies 

&#160;

Summary 

&#160;

The safety data from two Company-funded d-Methadone Phase 1 clinical safety studies and a third study conducted by researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center indicate that d-Methadone was safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and cancer patients at all projected therapeutic doses tested.

&#160;

In November 2014, Health Canada approved a Clinical Trial Application (&#8220;CTA&#8221;) to conduct the first Phase I study with d-Methadone. This was a Single Ascending Dose (&#8220;SAD&#8221;) study and was followed by a Multiple Ascending Dose (&#8220;MAD&#8221;) study, both in healthy volunteers. The two studies were designed to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of d-Methadone in healthy, opioid-na&#239;ve subjects. The SAD study included single escalating oral doses of d-Methadone to determine the maximum tolerated dose, defined as the highest dose devoid of significant opioid- or ketamine-like adverse events. In the MAD study, healthy subjects received daily oral doses of d-Methadone for several days to assess its safety, pharmacokinetics and tolerability. In March 2015, we reported that d-Methadone demonstrated a safe profile with no dose limiting side effects after four cohorts were exposed to increasing higher doses. In April 2015, the Company received clearance from Health Canada to continue with dose escalation and explore even higher single doses of d-Methadone. In June 2015, the Company successfully completed the SAD study and subsequently received a No Objection Letter (NOL) from Health Canada to conduct the MAD clinical study in August 2015. The MAD study was completed in January 2016 and the results successfully demonstrated a potential therapeutic dosing regimen for d-Methadone with a favorable side effect and tolerability profile. The data from these studies will inform the design of a subsequent Phase II proof-of-concept study in patients with depression and/or other suitable indications. 

&#160;

d-Methadone In Vivo Study for Depression 

&#160;

In May 2016, we announced the results of an in vivo study showing that administration of d-Methadone results in antidepressant-like effects in a well-validated treatment model, known as the forced swim test (FST), providing preclinical support for its potential as a novel treatment of depression.

&#160;

According to the Journal of Visualized Experiments , the FST is based on the assumption that when placing an animal in a container filled with water, it will first make efforts to escape by swimming or climbing, but eventually will exhibit &#8220;immobility&#8221; that may be considered to reflect a measure of behavioral despair. This test has been extensively used because it involves the exposure of the animals to stress, which was shown to have a role in the tendency for major depression. Additionally, the FST has been shown to share some of the factors that are influenced or altered by depression in humans, including changes in food consumption and sleep abnormalities. The main advantages of this procedure are that it is relatively easy to perform and that its results are easily and quickly analyzed. Importantly, the FST&#8217;s sensitivity to a broad range of antidepressant drugs makes it a suitable screening test and is one of the most important features leading to its high predictive validity.

&#160;

In the Company&#8217;s FST study, male Sprague Dawley rats were administered single doses of placebo, ketamine, or d-Methadone on day one (after habituation; 24 hours prior to forced swim testing). At all doses tested, d-Methadone significantly decreased immobility of the rats compared to the placebo, suggesting antidepressant-like activity. In addition, the effect of d-Methadone on immobility at the two highest doses tested was larger than the effect seen with ketamine. Moreover, the effects of d-Methadone in the forced swim test were not caused by a stimulant effect on spontaneous locomotor activity of the rats. Locomotor activity of lab animals is often monitored to assess the behavioral effects of drugs.

&#160;

A separate in vitro electrophysiology study of d-Methadone was conducted using 2 subtypes of cloned human NMDA receptors. The results of this study demonstrated functional antagonist activity with d-Methadone comparable to that of both racemic ketamine and the isomer [S]-ketamine.

&#160;

Combined with the results of our Phase I studies, the encouraging results of these in vivo and in vitro studies support our belief that d-Methadone warrants further evaluation in a Phase II study as a rapidly acting, oral agent for the treatment of depression.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

LevoCap ER (REL-1015) 

&#160;

Our most-advanced novel version of a proven drug product, LevoCap ER (REL-1015), is an extended release, abuse deterrent, and proprietary formulation of levorphanol (levo-3-hydroxy-N-methyl-morphinan), a unique, broad spectrum opioid with additional &#8220;non-opioid&#8221; mechanisms of action. In particular, levorphanol binds to all three opioid receptor subtypes involved in analgesia (mu, kappa, and delta), the NMDA receptor, and the norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake pumps, whereas morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and other opioids are highly selective for the mu receptor subtype. Due to its multi-modal mechanism of action, levorphanol could achieve analgesia in patients resistant to other strong opioids. In clinical studies, levorphanol has demonstrated a remarkably broad spectrum of analgesic activity against many different types of pain including neuropathic pain, post-surgical pain, and chronic pain in patients refractory to other opioids. To our knowledge, the analgesic tapentadol (Nucynta&#174;) is the only other commercially available, multimodal opioid with non-opioid analgesic benefits. However, in contrast to levorphanol&#8217;s strong opioid effects, tapentadol is a low affinity mu opioid receptor agonist and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

&#160;

Levorphanol is a potent opioid analgesic first introduced in the U.S. around 1953 for the treatment of moderate to severe pain where an opioid analgesic is appropriate. It is currently available as an immediate release (short-acting opioid), non-abuse deterrent formulation through Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. However, extended-release (long-acting opioid) agents may be preferable due to better patient adherence, less dose-watching, and result in improved sleep.

&#160;

Both immediate- and extended-release opioids can potentially be crushed to produce concentrated drug with greater appeal to abusers. Intentional crushing or extracting the active ingredient from the extended-release dosage form by addicts and recreational drug users can destroy the timed-release mechanism and result in a rapid surge of drug into the bloodstream for the purpose of achieving a high or euphoric feeling. Serious side effects and death have been reported from such misuse.

&#160;

LevoCap ER is the first product candidate utilizing SECUREL&#8482;, Relmada&#8217;s proprietary abuse deterrent extended release technology for opioid drugs. SECUREL dosage forms cannot be easily crushed for inhalation or to obtain rapid euphoria from high blood levels when swallowed. It is also exceedingly difficult for intravenous abusers to extract the active drug from the dosage form using common solvents, including alcohol.

&#160;

Relmada is developing LevoCap ER under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. We have submitted a meeting request to the FDA to discuss the Phase III clinical plan for LevoCap ER. 

&#160;

BuTab (REL-1028) 

&#160;

Our second-most-advanced novel version of a proven drug product, BuTab (REL-1028), represents novel formulations of oral, modified release buprenorphine as a potential therapeutic for both chronic pain and opioid dependence. Buprenorphine has been widely used by the sublingual and transdermal routes of administration, but was believed to be ineffective by the oral route because of poor oral bioavailability. We have completed a preclinical program to better define the pharmacokinetic profile of BuTab and to assess the time course of systemic absorption of buprenorphine using several different oral modified release formulations of buprenorphine in dogs, compared to an intravenous administration. Based on the results of this work, we obtained approval from Health Canada and initiated a Phase I pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers in the second quarter of 2015. This trial was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. The absolute bioavailability of BuTab relative to intravenous (IV) administration exceeded published data with non-modified buprenorphine when administered orally and compares favorably with a currently marketed transdermal buprenorphine patch. There were no safety or tolerability issues. The data generated by this study will guide formulation optimization and inform the design of subsequent clinical pharmacology studies.

&#160;

MepiGel (REL-1021) 

&#160;

MepiGel (REL-1021) is a proprietary topical dosage form of the local anesthetic mepivacaine for the treatment of painful peripheral neuropathies, such as painful diabetic neuropathy, PHN, and painful HIV-associated neuropathy. Mepivacaine is an anesthetic (numbing medicine) that blocks the nerve impulses that send pain signals to the brain. It is chemically related to bupivacaine but pharmacologically related to lidocaine. Mepivacaine is currently indicated for infiltration, nerve block and epidural anesthesia. Relmada has received two FDA Orphan Drug Designations for mepivacaine, one each for &#8220;the treatment of painful HIV-associated neuropathy&#8221; and for &#8220;the management of postherpetic neuralgia,&#8221; or PHN. We have selected the formulations to be advanced into clinical studies for MepiGel after the evaluation of results from in vitro and ex vivo studies comparing various topical prototypes of mepivacaine that were conducted by MedPharm Ltd, a specialist formulation development company recognized internationally for its expertise in topical and transdermal products. Multiple toxicology studies were successfully conducted and completed in 2015.

&#160;

Research and Development Expenses 

&#160;

A significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development and we intend to maintain our strong commitment to research and development. Research and development expense for the year ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended June 30, 2015, was approximately $6,206,700 and $7,872,400, respectively. 

&#160;

Overview of the 505(b)(2) Regulatory Pathway 

&#160;

The majority of our drug development pipeline is based on the application of drug delivery technologies and/or new dosage forms/indications to existing drugs for the creation of novel products. We then seek proprietary protection and FDA approval, and subsequently plan to commercialize these products ourselves or through partners. We believe that research and development efforts focused on novel dose forms of FDA approved drugs is less risky than attempting to discover new drugs, sometimes called new chemical entities (known as NCEs).

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

An important part of our strategy is the utilization of FDA&#8217;s 505(b)(2) NDA process for approval. The 505(b)(2) new drug application (NDA) is one of three FDA drug approval pathways and represents an appealing regulatory strategy for many companies. The pathway was created by the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, with 505(b)(2) referring to a section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The provisions of 505(b)(2) were created, in part, to help avoid unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a previously approved (&#8220;reference&#8221; or &#8220;listed&#8221;) drug; the section gives the FDA express permission to rely on data not developed by the NDA applicant.

&#160;

A 505(b)(2) NDA contains full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval, such as safety and efficacy information on the active ingredient, to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This can result in a much less expensive and much faster route to approval, compared with a traditional development path [such as 505(b)(1)], while creating new, differentiated products with tremendous commercial value.

&#160;

Overview of Orphan Drug Status 

&#160;

In accordance with laws and regulations pertaining to the Regulatory Agencies, a sponsor may request that the Regulatory Agencies designate a drug intended to treat a &#8220;Rare Disease or Condition&#8221; as an &#8220;Orphan Drug.&#8221; For example, in the United States, a &#8220;Rare Disease or Condition&#8221; is defined as one which affects less than 200,000 people in the United States, or which affects more than 200,000 people but for which the cost of developing and making available the product is not expected to be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Upon the approval of the first NDA or BLA for a drug designated as an orphan drug for a specified indication, the sponsor of that NDA or BLA is entitled to 7 years of exclusive marketing rights in the United States unless the sponsor cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities to meet the needs of persons with the disease. In Europe, this exclusivity is 10 years, and in Australia it is 5 years. However, orphan drug status is particular to the approved indication and does not prevent another company from seeking approval of an off-patent drug that has other labeled indications that are not under orphan or other exclusivities. Orphan drugs may also be eligible for federal income tax credits for costs associated with such as the disease state, the strength and complexity of the data presented, the novelty of the target or compound, risk-management approval and whether multiple rounds of review are required for the agency to evaluate the submission. There is no guarantee that a potential treatment will receive marketing approval or that decisions on marketing approvals or treatment indications will be consistent across geographic areas.

&#160; Our Corporate History and Background 

&#160; 

We are a clinical-stage, publicly traded biotechnology company developing NCEs together with novel versions of proven drug products that potentially address areas of high unmet medical need in the treatment of CNS diseases - primarily depression and chronic pain.

&#160;

Currently, none of our drugs have been approved for sale in the United States or elsewhere. We have no commercial products nor do we have a sales or marketing infrastructure. In order to market and sell our products we must conduct clinical trials on patients and obtain regulatory approvals from appropriate regulatory agencies, like the FDA in the United States, and similar organizations elsewhere in the world.

&#160;

We have not generated revenues and do not anticipate generating revenues for the foreseeable future. We had net loss of approximately $2,974,700 and $20,803,600 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. At June 30, 2016, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $79,100,000.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

Our strategy is to leverage our considerable industry experience, understanding of CNS markets and development expertise to identify, develop and commercialize product candidates with significant market potential that can fulfill unmet medical needs in the treatment of both depression and chronic pain. We have assembled a management team along with both scientific and business advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of depression and chronic pain, with significant industry and regulatory experience to lead and execute the development and commercialization of d-Methadone and our additional pipeline.

&#160;

We plan to further develop our novel, proprietary drug products via the 505(b)(2) development pathway and also to gain exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Act for new indications and also orphan drug designation in certain indications. We plan to also generate intellectual property (IP) that will further protect our products from competition. As the drug d-Methadone is not an already approved product by the FDA, the regulatory pathway to approval will be the more traditional NDA development, which may consist of conducting a full clinical development program. We will continue to prioritize our product development activities after taking into account the resources we have available, market dynamics and potential for adding value. We will continue to outsource development of our products, while retaining scientific, operational and financial oversight and control.

&#160;

We intend to seek and execute licensing and/or co-development agreements with companies capable of supporting the final stage development of the Company&#8217;s products and their subsequent commercialization in the U.S. and international markets. We may also develop our own internal sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize some or all of our products to selected specialty medical segments in the U.S. while out-licensing sales and marketing for the international market.

&#160;

We may in-license late-stage or approved drugs to accelerate the pathway to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with commercial capability. Alternatively, we might consider a trade sale of our products or the entire company if we deem that it is in the best interests of our shareholders.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Market Opportunity 

&#160;

We believe that the market for addressing areas of high unmet medical need in the treatment of CNS diseases will continue to be large for the foreseeable future and that it will represent a sizable revenue opportunity for Relmada. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that CNS diseases affect nearly 2 billion people globally, making up approximately 40% of total disease burden (based on disability adjusted life years), compared with 13% for cancer and 12% for cardiovascular disease. We also believe that each of our product candidates is designed to have value added features that will provide product related competitive advantages versus the existing drugs available on the market.

&#160;

Depression 

&#160;

The depression treatment market is segmented on the basis of antidepressants drugs, devices, and therapies. Antidepressants are the largest and most popular market segment. According to Research and Markets, every year more than 5 billion antidepressant prescriptions are written globally. The antidepressants segment consists of large pharmaceutical and generic companies, such as Eli Lilly, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline and Forest Laboratories. Some of the popular drugs produced by these companies are Prozac&#174; (Eli Lilly, Cymbalta&#174; (Eli Lilly), Effexor&#174; (Pfizer), and Pristiq&#174; (Pfizer).

&#160;

Chronic Pain 

&#160;

The pain market is well established, with many pharmaceutical companies marketing innovative products as well as generic versions of older, non-patent protected products. In 2014, according to data from IMS Health, there were 328 million pain prescriptions representing $13 billion in annual sales in the U.S. Analgesics continue to be among the most widely prescribed medications and there is little to suggest that their preeminence will change in the near future, given the prominent role of pain in many diseases. Survey data indicate substantial patient dissatisfaction with current pain management modalities.

&#160;

Intellectual Property Portfolio and Market Exclusivity 

&#160;

We have secured three Orphan Drug Designations from the FDA: 1) d-Methadone for &#8220;the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia&#8221;; 2) MepiGel for &#8220;the treatment of painful HIV-associated neuropathy&#8221;; and MepiGel for &#8220;the management of postherpetic neuralgia.&#8221; Each would, upon NDA approval, carry 7-year FDA Orphan Drug marketing exclusivity. In the European Union, some of our products may be eligible up to 10 years of market exclusivity, which includes 8 years data exclusivity and 2 years market exclusivity. In addition to any granted patents, our products will be eligible for market exclusivity to run concurrently with the term of the patent for 3 years in the U.S. (Hatch Waxman plus pediatric exclusivity) and up to 10 years of in the E.U. We believe an extensive intellectual property estate of several patents will protect our technology and products once our patent applications for our products are approved.

Key Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that the key elements for our market success include:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; A multiple product portfolio with a balanced risk reward profile: We have four products at various stages of development, and each has its own development risk profile and indication. Accordingly, management believes that we are well positioned to become a competitive player in a large unsatisfied market. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Products are differentiated and address significant unmet needs: All four lead development programs are well differentiated, value added CNS drugs that address significant unmet medical needs. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Scientific support of leading experts: Our scientific and business advisors include clinicians and scientists who are affiliated with a number of highly regarded medical institutions. The group consists of individuals who have served as executives of leading national and international societies in depression, pain, and the FDA. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Efficient development strategy: The 505(b)(2) pathway lowers the risk of drug development. Our strategy of combining proven drug candidates with novel delivery methods and pharmaceutical compositions reduces clinical development time and costs and lowers regulatory risks, while delivering valuable products in areas of high unmet need to the market place. Abuse resistant and once a day formulations improve the commercial potential of opioids, addressing the risk of opioid abuse and opioid diversion by making the dosage form tamper resistant, thereby frustrating attempts at physical manipulation of the dosage. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Substantial IP portfolio and market protection: Upon the approval of our filed patent applications for our products we will have secured an intellectual property portfolio comprised of several patents. In addition, some of our drugs have also been designated as Orphan Drugs by the FDA, thereby providing seven years of market exclusivity at launch. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Experienced management: We combine business expertise with what we believe is an internationally recognized research team. We believe our highly experienced drug development leadership provides us with a significant competitive advantage in designing highly efficient clinical programs with predictable regulatory outcomes. &#160;

Competition Overview 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Competition is intense among manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals and other product areas where we may develop and market products in the future. Most of our competitors are large, well-established pharmaceutical or healthcare companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than are available to us. Additionally, many of our competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow such competitors to develop new or improved products that may compete with our products. Our products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products.

&#160;

Regarding our competitive position in the industry, none of our products have been approved for sale.

&#160;

Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapies for TRD with the mechanism of action of d-Methadone. However, products approved for other indications, for example, low doses of the anesthetic ketamine, are being or may be increasingly used off-label for treating depression, as well as other CNS indications for which d-Methadone may have therapeutic potential. Additionally, other treatment options, such psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy, are sometimes used instead of and before antidepressant medications to treat patients with TRD.

In the field of new generation antidepressants focused on specifically blocking the NMDA receptor channel, our principal competitor is intranasal esketamine, an isomer of ketamine, currently in Phase III clinical trials sponsored by Johnson &#38; Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceutica. Other potential competitors focused on modulation of the NMDA receptor at its glycine co-agonist site include Allergan plc, which is developing rapastinel (formerly GLYX-13) and NRX-1074 for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). On August 28, 2015, Allergan acquired rapastinel and NRX-1074 from Naurex, Inc. in an all-cash transaction of $571.7 million, plus future contingent payments up to $1.15 billion. These two drug candidates are modified peptides and only one may be orally active (rapastinel is only administered intravenously; NRX-1074 is orally bioavailable). VistaGen Therapeutics, Inc. is developing AV-101, an orally available prodrug candidate that gains access to the CNS after systemic administration and is rapidly converted in the brain into its active metabolite, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), a well-characterized, potent and highly selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor at the glycine co-agonist site. Cerecor Inc. is developing CERC-301, an oral and NR2B-specific NMDA antagonist.

The pain market has peculiar characteristics with regards to competition. While there are several products in development both in the narcotic and neuropathic pain space, the market history has shown that a new entry in the therapeutic area does not necessarily cannibalize existing products, but instead expands the market. The reasons behind this behavior can be found in the &#8220;opioid rotation&#8221; phenomena. As there is considerable variability in the efficacy and side effect response of patients to opioid analgesics, many patients rotate from one opioid to another, offering growth opportunity to new entries. In the case of the neuropathic pain indication, it is mostly the limited efficacy of the existing therapies that creates a strong demand for new entries, a model also supported by the considerable off-label use of opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in neuropathic pain.

&#160;

Because of the large CNS opportunity, the current competitive landscape is comprised by a significant number of pharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, Abbott Laboratories, Acadia, Alkermes, Allergan, AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Endo Pharmaceutical Holding, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Lundbeck, Mallinckrodt, Merck, Novartis, Ono, Otsuka, Pfizer, Purdue Pharma, Roche, Sanofi, Shire, Sumitomo, Takeda and Teva. In addition, we are aware that several companies are working on new delivery forms of pain products and abuse deterrent formulations, including Acura Pharmaceutical, BioDelivery Science, Collegium Pharmaceutical, Egalet, Elite Pharmaceutical, Inspirion Delivery Technologies, Intellipharmaceutics International, and KemPharm.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, controlled substances and finished pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by Relmada.

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates such products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as amended and regulations pursuant to the FDCA.

&#160;

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), a division of the Department of Justice, administers the federal Controlled Substances Act (&#8220;CSA&#8221;) of 1970, as amended. The CSA imposes various registration, record-keeping and reporting requirements, procurement and manufacturing quotas, import and export controls, labeling and packaging requirements, security controls, and a restriction on prescription refills on certain pharmaceutical products.

&#160;

To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure of companies to maintain compliance, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action including civil and criminal penalties, refusal to renew necessary registrations, or initiating proceedings to revoke those registrations. If a manufacturer or distributor has its registration revoked, it can no longer lawfully possess or distribute controlled substances meaning effectively that the operations of such an organization must cease with respect to controlled substances. In certain circumstances, violations also can lead to criminal proceedings.

&#160;

Most states impose similar controls over controlled substances under state law as regulated by the Board of Pharmacy or other state regulatory authorities.

&#160;

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also regulate certain pharmaceutical marketing practices. Thus, reimbursement practices of the HHS covering medicine and medical services are important to the success of our products.

&#160;

We are also subject to United States regulation under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Drug Enforcement Administration regulations require Scheduled II controlled substances to be manufactured in the United States if the products are to be marketed in the United States. Our only products that contain Schedule II controlled substances are LevoCap ER and d-Methadone. We are in the process of transferring all third party manufacturing of these products to the United States, and we intend to comply with this CSA requirement.

&#160;

We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.

&#160;

Failure to comply with applicable FDA, DEA, FTC, HHS and other federal and state regulations and requirements, both before and after drug approval may subject us to administrative and judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and/or criminal prosecution.

&#160;

Relmada believes that a two tiered approach can reduce overall clinical development risks. Our approach consists of: (1) developing improved versions of proven drug candidates and filings under 505(b)(2) which may require an abbreviated clinical development program; and (2) developing a drug in treating conditions that have not been approved by the FDA, and filings under the traditional NDA which would require a full clinical development program. In general, drugs for the 505(b)(2) filing possess less risks as compared to drugs filed under the traditional NDA route. As with all drugs filed with the FDA, there is no guarantee of approval.

&#160;

Please see &#8220;Company Overview&#8221; above for a status of our drug development.

&#160;

U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation 

&#160;

Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the United States are subject to the FDCA as implemented and enforced by the FDA. Certain of our product candidates in the United States require FDA pre-marketing approval of an NDA pursuant to 21 C.F.R. &#167; 314. Foreign countries may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market these products.

&#160;

Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, the DEA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to: untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying our requests for NDA premarket approval of new products or modified products; withdrawing NDA approvals that have already been granted; refusal to grant export approval for our products; or criminal prosecution.
