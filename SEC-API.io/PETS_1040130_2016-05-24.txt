Sales 

&#160; 

We offer our products through three main sales channels: Internet through our website, telephone contact center through our toll-free number, and direct mail/print through 1-800-PetMeds catalogs, brochures, and postcards. We have designed our website and catalogs to provide a convenient, cost-effective, and informative shopping experience that encourages consumers to purchase products important for a pet&#8217;s health and quality of life. We believe that these multiple channels allow us to increase the visibility of our brand name and provide our customers with increased shopping flexibility and excellent service. 

&#160; 

Internet 

&#160; 

We seek to combine our product selection and pet health information with the shopping ease of the Internet to deliver a convenient and personalized shopping experience. Our website offers health and nutritional product selections for dogs and cats, and relevant editorial and easily obtainable or retrievable resource information. From our home page, customers can search our website for products and access resources on a variety of information on dogs and cats. Customers can shop at our website by category, product line, individual product, or symptom. We attracted approximately 33 million visitors to our website during fiscal 2016, approximately 8% of those visitors placed an order, and our website generated approximately 81% of our total sales for the same time period. On our website pet owners have access to health information covering pets&#8217; behavior and illnesses, and natural and pharmaceutical remedies specifically for a pet&#8217;s problem. The pet education content on our main website is periodically updated with the latest research for pet owners. 

&#160; 

Telephone Contact Center 

&#160; 

Our customer care representatives receive and process inbound and outbound customer calls, facilitate our live web chat, and process customer e-mails. Our telephone system is equipped with certain features including pop-up screens and call blending capabilities that give us the ability to efficiently utilize our customer care representatives&#8217; time, providing excellent customer care, service, and support. Our customer care representatives receive a base salary and are rewarded with commissions for sales, and bonuses and other awards for achieving certain quality goals. 

&#160; 

Direct Mail/Print 

&#160; 

The 1-800-PetMeds catalog is a full-color catalog that features our most popular products. The catalog is produced by a combination of in-house writers, production artists, and independent contractors. We mail catalogs, brochures, and postcards in response to requests generated from our advertising and as part of direct mail campaigns to our customers. 

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

Approximately 2.3 million customers have purchased from us within the last two years. We attracted approximately 489,000 and 529,000 new customers in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our customers are located throughout the United States, with approximately 50% of customers residing in California, Florida, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia. Our primary focus has been on retail customers and the average purchase was approximately $81 for fiscal 2016 compared to $77 for fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

The goal of our marketing strategy is to build brand recognition, increase customer traffic, add new customers, build strong customer loyalty, maximize reorders, and develop incremental revenue opportunities. We have an integrated marketing campaign that includes television advertising, online marketing, direct mail/print and e-mail. 

&#160; 

Television Advertising 

&#160; 

Our television advertising is designed to build brand equity, create brand awareness, and generate initial purchases of products via the telephone and the Internet. We have used :30 and :15 second television commercials to attract new customer orders. Our television commercials typically focus on our ability to rapidly deliver to customers the same medications offered by veterinarians, but at reduced prices. We generally purchase advertising to target our key demographic group &#8211; women, ages 30 to 65. We believe that television advertising is particularly effective and instrumental in building brand awareness.

We utilize Internet display and video advertisements, social media, and comparison shopping, and we are also members of the LinkShare Network, which is an affiliate program with merchant clients and affiliate websites. 

&#160; 

Direct Mail/Print and E-mail 

&#160; 

We use direct mail/print and e-mail to acquire new customers and to remind our existing customers to reorder. 

&#160; 

Operations 

&#160; 

Order Processing 

&#160; 

Our website allows customers to easily browse and purchase all of our products online. Our website is designed to be fast, secure, and easy to use with order and shipping confirmations, and with online order tracking capabilities. We provide our customers with toll-free telephone access to our customer care representatives. Our call center generally operates from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM, Monday through Thursday, 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM on Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Saturday, and 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM on Sunday, Eastern Time. The process of customers purchasing products from 1-800-PetMeds consists of a few simple steps. A customer first places an order online or a call to our toll-free telephone number. The following information is needed to process prescription orders: pet information, prescription information, and the veterinarian&#8217;s name and phone number. This information is entered into our computer system. Then our pharmacists and pharmacy technicians verify all prescriptions. The order process system checks for the verification for prescription medication orders and a valid payment method for all orders. An invoice is generated and printed in our fulfillment center, where items are picked, and then shipped via United States Postal Service, Federal Express, or UPS. Our customers enjoy the convenience of rapid home delivery, with the majority of all orders being shipped within 24 hours of ordering. 

&#160; 

Customer Care and Support 

&#160; 

We believe that a high level of customer care and support is critical in retaining and expanding our customer base. Customer care representatives participate in ongoing training programs under the supervision of our training managers. These training sessions include a variety of topics such as product knowledge, computer usage, customer service tips, and the relationship between our Company and veterinarians. Our customer care representatives respond to customers&#8217; e-mails, calls, and live chats that are related to products, order status, prices, and shipping. We believe our customer care representatives are a valuable source of feedback regarding customer satisfaction. 

&#160; 

Warehousing and Shipping 

&#160; 

We inventory our products and fill most customer orders from our corporate headquarters in Pompano Beach, Florida. We have an in-house fulfillment and distribution operation, which is used to manage the entire supply chain, beginning with the placement of the order, continuing through order processing, and then fulfilling and shipping of the product to the customer. We offer a variety of shipping options, including next day delivery. We ship to anywhere in the United States served by the United States Postal Service or Federal Express. Priority orders are expedited in our fulfillment process. Our goal is to ship the products the same day that the order is received. For prescription medications, our goal is to ship the product immediately after the prescription has been authorized by the customer&#8217;s veterinarian. 

&#160; 

Purchasing 

&#160; 

We purchase our products from a variety of sources, including certain manufacturers, domestic distributors, and wholesalers. There were four suppliers from whom we purchased approximately 50% of all products in fiscal 2016. We purchase the majority of the health and nutritional supplements directly from manufacturers. We believe having strong relationships with product manufacturers will ensure the availability of an adequate volume of products ordered by our customers, and will enable us to provide more and better product information. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Historically, many of the major manufacturers of prescription and non-prescription medications have declined to sell these products to direct marketing companies, such as our Company. (See Risk Factors.) Part of our growth strategy includes developing direct relationships with the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers of the more popular prescription and non-prescription medications. 

&#160; 

Technology 

&#160; 

We utilize integrated technologies in our call centers, e-commerce, order entry, and inventory control/fulfillment operations. Our systems are custom configured by the Company to optimize our computer telephone integration and mail-order processing. The systems are designed to maintain a large database of specialized information and process a large volume of orders efficiently and effectively. Our systems provide our customer care representatives, and our customers on our website, with real time product availability information and updated customer information to enhance our customer care. We also have an integrated direct connection for processing credit cards to ensure that a valid credit card number and authorization have been received at the same time our customer care representatives are on the phone with the customer or when a customer submits an order on our website. Our information systems provide our customer care representatives with records of all prior contact with a customer, including the customer&#8217;s address, phone number, e-mail address, prescription information, order history, payment history, and notes. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The pet medications market is competitive and highly fragmented. Our competitors consist of veterinarians, and online and traditional retailers. We believe that the following are the principal competitive factors in our market: 

&#160; 

&#183; Product selection and availability, including the availability of prescription and non-prescription medications; &#183; Brand recognition; &#183; Reliability and speed of delivery; &#183; Personalized service and convenience; &#183; Price; and &#183; Quality of website content. &#160; 

We compete with veterinarians for the sale of prescription and non-prescription pet medications and other health products. Many pet owners may prefer the convenience of purchasing their pet medications or other health products at the time of a veterinarian visit. In order to effectively compete with veterinarians, we must continue to educate pet owners about the service, convenience, and savings offered by our Company. 

&#160; 

According to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, pet spending in the United States increased 3.9% to $60.3 billion in 2015. Pet supplies and medications represented $14.3 billion, or 24% of the total spending on pets in the United States. The pet medication market that we participate in is estimated to be approximately $4.2 billion, with veterinarians having the majority of the market share. The dog and cat population is approximately 164 million, with approximately 65% of all households having a pet. 

&#160; 

We believe that the following are the main competitive strengths that differentiate 1-800-PetMeds from the competition: 

&#160; 

&#183; Channel leader, in an estimated $4.2 billion industry; &#183; &#8220;1-800-PetMeds&#8221; brand name; &#183; Licensed pharmacy to conduct business in 50 states, and awarded Vet-VIPPS CM (Veterinary-Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Site) accreditation by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy&#174;; &#183; Exceptional customer care and support &#160;

We believe the &#8220;1-800-PetMeds&#8221; trade name, which is also our toll-free telephone number, and the &#8220;PetMeds&#8221; family of trademarks, has added significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our products.

Government Regulation

As a licensed pharmacy in the State of Florida, we are subject to the Florida Pharmacy Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the extent that we are unable to maintain our license as a community pharmacy with the Florida Board of Pharmacy, or if we do not maintain the licenses granted by other state pharmacy boards, or if we become subject to actions by the FDA, or other enforcement regulators, our distribution of prescription medications to pet owners could cease, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
