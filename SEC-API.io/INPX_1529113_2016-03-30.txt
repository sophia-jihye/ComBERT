 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

&#160;

(Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms &#8220;Sysorex&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refers collectively to Sysorex Global , f/k/a Sysorex Global Holdings Corp., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.) 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160;

Sysorex provides data analytics and location based solutions and services to commercial and government customers worldwide. We have developed a new kind of discovery platform that blends data from traditional software and network systems with the growing universe of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT). In doing so we have created a high velocity, secure and scalable platform that we believe allows our customers to evaluate their most complex business issues, and compete successfully in their respective markets. Our products are designed to help customers derive real time value by combining both the physical and digital worlds.

&#160;

Our data analytics products integrate with our AirPatrol product line, which includes technology for enterprises, government agencies, developers, and services providers aimed at improving mobile security, improving information access and boosting application engagement by adding location-based delivery and management by collecting data from any wireless device in close proximity (Cellular, WiFi, BLE, RFID, etc.) and extending to any connected device in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape. We believe our products can deliver critical information at the right time based on our integrated solutions allowing us to uniquely blend the real world and the digital world. We believe our AirPatrol product line is also well positioned for the Cyber Security market as a mobile device management and detection technology solution. We believe our location accuracy of less than 10-feet and ability to capture all RF frequencies is unmatched. Detecting rogue devices that could be a security threat to an enterprise or government agency and then providing accurate location of that device is an important security application for our customers. Our AirPatrol product line has two patents and several others pending worldwide.

&#160;

Sysorex also provides supporting products and services including enterprise computing and storage, virtualization, business continuity, data migration; custom application development, networking and information technology business consulting services. These allow Sysorex to offer turnkey solutions when requested by customers.

&#160;

Corporate Strategy 

&#160;

Management is focused on transforming Sysorex from its legacy systems integration business to a data analytics products business providing turnkey solutions from collection of data to delivering insights from that data to our customers. We have successfully acquired certain technology/IP related to the IT industry and may complete additional strategic acquisitions in the future to expand our products and services. Management believes acquiring products/IP will add value to the Company and may allow us to command a higher market valuation or sales price should there be a sale or a spinoff. We are seeking opportunities with the following profiles:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Innovative and commercially proven technologies primarily in Big Data analytics, cyber-security, IoT, Cloud and mobile/bring your own device (&#8220; BYOD &#8221;). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Companies with proven technologies that are complementary to the Company&#8217;s overall strategy. We are looking at companies primarily in the United States. However, we may expand our search into other geographies such as India, Europe and beyond, if there are significant strategic and financial reasons to do so. &#160;

An important element of our mergers and acquisitions strategy is to acquire companies with complementary capabilities/technologies and an established customer base in each of the above categories. We believe that the customer base of each potential acquisition will also present an opportunity to cross-sell our existing solutions.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We intend to acquire these innovative technologies and established, reputable IT services companies, using restricted common stock, cash and debt financing in combinations appropriate for each potential acquisition.

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

The Company was formed in Nevada in April 1999, under the name Liquidation Bid, Inc. It changed its name to Softlead, Inc. on September 9, 2003.

&#160;

On March 1, 2011 by a majority vote of shareholders at a special meeting, the Company elected to change its name to Sysorex Global Holdings Corp.; effect a 1-for-20 reverse split of its stock; increase the authorized shares to 30,000,000 and acquire the Sysorex operational businesses. On June 2, 2011, the Company effected a 1-for-20 reverse split and changed its name to Sysorex Global Holdings Corp.

&#160;

On July 29, 2011, the Company acquired all of the stock of the U.S. Federal Government business of Sysorex (Sysorex Federal and its subsidiary Sysorex Government) and 50.2% of the stock of the operating unit of Sysorex engaged in Saudi Arabian Government contracts (Sysorex Arabia, LLC). The acquisition was based on a share exchange, with Sysorex shareholders being issued 14,600,000 restricted common shares of the Company in exchange for stock of the three operating entities.

&#160;

The Company recapitalized itself by amending its Articles of Incorporation on August 3, 2011 and increased its authorized common stock to 30,000,000 shares, with a par value $0.001 per share, which was approved at the Shareholder Meeting on March 1, 2011. On September 1, 2011, the Board of Directors and the majority shareholders authorized the increase of the authorized shares from 30,000,000 to 40,000,000; however, the filing of the Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation was not filed with the State of Nevada until April, 2012.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On March 20, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of the assets of Lilien LLC, for an aggregate purchase price of $9,000,000 in accordance with the terms and conditions of an Asset Purchase and Merger Agreement (the &#8220; APMA &#8221;), effective March 1, 2013. The purchase price consisted of $3,000,000 in cash and 3,000,000 shares of restricted common stock of Sysorex deemed to have a fair value of $6,000,000, or $2.00 per share, issued to the members of Lilien, LLC (the &#8220; Former Lilien Members &#8221;) in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of Lilien Systems, Inc. (&#8220;Lilien&#8221; and the &#8220;Lilien Acquisition&#8221;). The cash consideration of $3,000,000 was obtained by the Company under a credit facility entered into for the purpose of completing the acquisition. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; In addition, the Company contingently guaranteed (the &#8220; Guaranty &#8221;) to the Former Lilien Members the net sales price of $2.00 per share (as adjusted) for a two year period following the closing, provided the Former Lilien Members complied with the terms and conditions of the lock-up agreement. At the end of the two-year Guaranty period, the Former Lilien Members had an option within ten days after the Guaranty period to put all, but not less than all, of their unsold shares to the Company, for the price of $2.00 per unsold share. None of the Former Lilien Members exercised that option.

&#160;

Under the APMA, the Former Lilien Members were entitled to any excess cash above $1,000,000, provided both Lilien&#8217;s net worth immediately preceding the closing was greater than $1,000,000 and its net worth less excess cash of at least $1,000,000 was greater than $1,000,000. As a result of a post-closing adjustment, Lilien&#8217;s net worth was less than $1,000,000 and the Former Lilien Members refunded $153,000 to the Company, subject to further adjustment. The refund was subsequently adjusted to $38,750 and settled.

&#160;

Lilien Systems is based in Larkspur, California and an information technology company, which significantly expanded the Company&#8217;s operations providing it a Big Data analytics platform and enterprise infrastructure capabilities. Lilien delivers right-fit information technology solutions that help organizations reach their next level of business advantage. Lilien brings unsurpassed commitment, a highly qualified and educated staff of data scientists and computer engineers, premier technology certifications, key manufacturer partnerships, and business vision to its solutions in enterprise computing and storage, virtualization, business continuity, networking and IT business consulting. Lilien Systems was renamed Sysorex USA effective January 1, 2016.

&#160;

Effective upon the completion of the Lilien Acquisition, Geoffrey Lilien, Bret Osborn and Dhruv Gulati were elected to Sysorex Global&#8217;s then existing Board of Directors of three persons. Mr. Osborn and Mr. Gulati subsequently resigned as directors; however, they currently serve as the Chief Sales Officer and Executive Vice President, respectively, of Sysorex USA f/k/a Lilien Systems.

&#160;

Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 31, 2013, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sysorex was merged with and into Shoom which continued its existence as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sysorex. Sysorex issued approximately 1,381,000 shares of its common stock to the former shareholders of Shoom, plus their pro rata share of $2,500,000 cash consideration, subject to adjustment based on the Net Worth (as defined in the Agreement of Plan and Merger) of Shoom as of August 31, 2013 compared with $6,038,020, the net worth of Shoom on July 31, 2013. Of this amount, approximately 250,000 shares of Sysorex common stock, plus approximately $500,000 of the cash consideration is being held in escrow for the benefit of the former Shoom stockholders, pro rata, for one year as security to satisfy any claim for indemnity claims, other than tax matters for which there is a seven-year escrow. As of December 31, 2015 all the escrow shares have been released to the former Shoom stockholders and approximately $352,000 remains in the escrow for tax matters to be released pro-rata over the next five years. All of the Company&#8217;s 1,381,000 shares issued in the Shoom Acquisition were restricted and subject to lock-up agreements for a six-month period which ended on October 8, 2014. In addition, the Company issued stock options to Shoom employees to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Sysorex common stock.

Effective April 18, 2014, the Company acquired 100% of the stock of AirPatrol Corporation, a company in the mobile cyber-security and location-based services space with leading-edge solutions and proprietary intellectual property (&#8220;AirPatrol&#8221; and the &#8220;AirPatrol Acquisition&#8221;), in accordance with the terms and conditions of an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;), dated December 20, 2013, as amended on February 28, 2014 for an aggregate purchase price equal to (a) $10,000,000 in cash, subject to certain adjustments, allocated to and among certain creditors, payees and holders of AirPatrol&#8217;s issued and outstanding capital stock and (b) 2,000,000 shares of Company&#8217;s common stock, of which 800,000 was held in escrow for one year, as security to satisfy any indemnity claims that may be owed by the AirPatrol shareholders to the Company (the &#8220; Merger Consideration &#8221;). The Merger Consideration included an earnout, half of the value of which shall be in stock and the other half in cash (unless otherwise agreed or required pursuant to the Merger Agreement) payable to the shareholders of AirPatrol in 2015 in accordance with the following formula: if for the five quarter period ending March 31, 2015, AirPatrol Net Income (as defined in the Merger Agreement) meets or exceeds $3,500,000, the Company shall pay to the AirPatrol shareholders an earnout payment equal to (i) AirPatrol Net Income, divided by $5,000,000, times (ii) $10,000,000, provided that the total earnout payment shall not exceed $10,000,000.

&#160;

On April 18, 2014, the Company consummated the AirPatrol Acquisition, and on the closing date paid adjusted Merger Consideration of $8,466,258 in cash, and 1,842,809 shares of common stock (800,000 shares of which were deposited into a holdback escrow for indemnity purposes).

&#160;

On May 30, 2014 the Company and AirPatrol entered into a Waiver and Amendment No. 3 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (this &#8220; Waiver and Amendment &#8221;) which was a post-closing waiver and amendment to the Merger Agreement. The fees of the shareholder representative of AirPatrol, Shareholder Representative Services LLC (the &#8220; Representative &#8221;) were inadvertently not paid by AirPatrol, and not reflected as an AirPatrol merger expense at the time of closing. Upon execution and delivery of the Waiver Amendment, the Company paid $37,500, representing the total amount of the engagement fee owed to the Representative.

&#160;

The total recorded purchase price for the transaction was $19.7 million which consisted of $9.5 million cash paid and $10.2 million for the value of stock. The Company evaluated the fair value of the contingent earn out liability and determined nothing was owed. During 2015 an agreement was reached between the Company and the Representative regarding the 800,000 shares that were deposited in the holdback escrow whereby the sum of 561,172 shares were authorized to be released to the AirPatrol shareholders and 238,828 shares were released to the Company for cancellation.

Government IT Services and Solutions Market 

&#160;

The U.S. government spends approximately $80 billion on IT annually. This spending is expected to continue at a 3% growth rate vs. 6% historically because of the government&#8217;s budget challenges. ( Source : Market Research Media - U.S. Federal IT Market Forecast 2013-2018.) Security of all forms, especially cyber-security, are significant growth areas ( Source : Market Research Media - U.S. Federal Cyber Security Market Forecast 2013-2018) and Sysorex intends to increase its role in this sector. Sysorex Government is servicing U.S. Government customers in both civilian and defense agencies. Sysorex Government provides a variety of IT solutions and services (custom application development, project management, systems integration, etc.) through its various government contract vehicles including our GSA Schedule, SPAWAR, TEIS-III, SEWP, and others. Sysorex Government serves as a prime and subcontractor depending on the contract. We believe Sysorex Government is also well positioned to win foreign military sales contracts leveraging the Sysorex Group presence overseas.

&#160;

Through Sysorex Government , the Company enters into various types of contracts with our customers, such as Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE), Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Completion, Cost-reimbursement (CR), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Fixed-Price Incentive (FPI) and Time-and-materials (T&#38;M).

&#160;

IDIQ contracts provide for an indefinite quantity of services or stated limits of supplies for a fixed period. They are used when the customer cannot determine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that the government will require during the contract period. IDIQs help streamline the contract process and speed service delivery. IDIQ contracts are most often used for service contracts and architect-engineering services. Awards are usually for base years and option years. The customer places delivery orders (for supplies) or task orders (for services) against a basic contract for individual requirements. Minimum and maximum quantity limits are specified in the basic contract as either a number of units (for supplies) or as dollar values (for services).

&#160;

CPFF LOE contracts will be issued when the scope of work is defined in general terms requiring only that the contractor devote a specified LOE for a stated time period. A CPFF completion contract will be issued when the scope of work defines a definite goal or target which leads to an end product deliverable (e.g., a final report of research accomplishing the goal or target).

&#160;

CR contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. These contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed (except at its own risk) without the approval of the contracting officer and are suitable for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.

&#160;

FFP contracts will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of definite or detailed specifications and fair and reasonable prices can be established at the outset.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

FPI target delivery contracts will be issued when acquiring supplies or services on the basis of reasonably definite or detailed specifications and cost can be reasonably predicted at the outset wherein the cost risk will be shared. A firm target cost, target profit, and profit adjustment formula will be negotiated to provide a fair and reasonable incentive and a ceiling that provides for the contractor to assume an appropriate share of the risk.

&#160;

T&#38;M contracts provide for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of (1) direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit; and (2) actual cost for materials. A customer may use this contract when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

Sysorex utilizes direct marketing through approximately 47 outside and inside sales representatives, who are compensated with a base salary and some sales positions receive incentive plans such as commission or bonus plans. Sysorex utilizes webinars, conferences, tradeshows and other direct and indirect marketing activities to generate demand for its products and services. Sysorex also has extensive relationships with channel partners to directly engage with customers and to perform the installation services. Sysorex trains its partners and has its own channel/partner managers to support and augment partners as needed. 

&#160;

Sysorex has built a core competency in bidding on government requests for proposals. It utilizes its internal bid and proposal team as well as consultants to prepare the proposal responses for Government clients. Sysorex also uses business development, sales and account management employees or consultants and expects to increase these departments as the Company grows.

&#160;

These customers including federal and international government agencies to enterprise customers in retail, manufacturing, life sciences, bio-tech, high-tech, agriculture, financial services, state and local government, utilities, media &#38; entertainment, telecom and many other verticals.

Competition 

&#160;

Sysorex faces competition from different companies, both small and large, for different parts of its business. The management team at Sysorex has 30 plus years of experience in these areas and knows how to compete against start-ups as well as larger businesses. In the Big Data analytics space, these competitors and sometimes partners could include, HP, IBM, Splunk, Fusion Storm, Global Inc., Bear Data, LLC.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our AirPatrol products compete with WiFi based detection companies such as Aruba, Cisco, Euclid Analytics and other smaller companies. However, these companies can only do WiFi detection and therefore we believe cannot get the accuracy that AirPatrol can. AirPatrol has partnered or replaced some of these types of companies because it offers WiFi, cellular, RFID, blue-tooth, etc. and approximately sub-10-feet in location accuracy. Mobile device management companies like AirWatch, Mobile Iron and Good Technology have also integrated with AirPatrol instead of developing competing products. MerlinOne and PressTeligence have part of our Shoom products functionality but usually only provide information for the specific customer and not for their competitors or for the industry.

&#160;

In our government services sector there are large systems integrators and defense contractors as well as small businesses, 8a, Women-owned, Veteran Disabled, Alaskan Native, etc. Some of these competitors include global defense and IT service companies including IBM Global Services, LogicaCMG, CSC, ATOS Origins, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon IT Services and SAIC. 

&#160;

This complex landscape of domestic and multi-national services companies creates a challenging environment. However, Sysorex has a successful history and brand that it believes it can leverage. Our strategy is to be a global services provider with a focus in two high growth markets cyber-security and data analytics.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

The Company currently does not have any legally filed trademarks for the name Sysorex.

Management believes that use of the Company&#8217;s intellectual property does not infringe upon any rights held by other parties.

&#160;

&#160;

As of March 21, 2016, Sysorex has 127 employees, including 2 part-time employees. This includes 6 officers, 47 sales people, 4 marketing people, 53 technical/engineering people and 17 finance &#38; administration persons. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

&#160;

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160;

As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our most recently completed fiscal year, we qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; &#160;

&#160; &#9679; No non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; &#160;

&#160; &#9679; Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and &#160;

Reduced disclosure of financial information in this report, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As a smaller reporting company, each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year-period.

&#160;

The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We are choosing to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of this provision. Therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
