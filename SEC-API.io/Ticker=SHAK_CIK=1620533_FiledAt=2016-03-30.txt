 Item 1. Business. 

Shake Shack Inc. is a Delaware corporation formed on September 23, 2014. Shake Shack Inc. Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SHAK." Unless the context otherwise requires, "we," "us," "our," "Shake Shack," the "Company" and other similar references refer to Shake Shack Inc. and, unless otherwise stated, all of its subsidiaries, including SSE Holdings, LLC, which we refer to as "SSE Holdings." 

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING AND ORGANIZATIONAL TRANSACTIONS 

&#160; 

O n February 4, 2015, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of 5,750,000 &#32;shares of our Class A common stock at a public offering price of $21.00 &#32;per share, which includes 750,000 &#32;shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option. We received $112.3 &#32;million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, which we used to purchase newly-issued membership interests from SSE Holdings at a price per interest equal to the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock of $21.00 . 

Shake Shack is a holding company with no direct operations and our principal asset is our equity interest in SSE Holdings. In connection with the IPO, we completed a series of organizational transactions including the following: 

&#9642; 

We amended and restated the limited liability company agreement of SSE Holdings (as amended, the "SSE Holdings LLC Agreement") to, among other things, (i) provide for a new single class of common membership interests in SSE Holdings ("LLC Interests"), (ii) exchange all of the then-existing membership interests of the holders of SSE Holdings&#8217; membership interests ("Original SSE Equity Owners") for LLC Interests and (iii) appoint Shake Shack as the sole managing member of SSE Holdings; 

&#9642; 

We amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to, among other things, (i) provide for Class B common stock with voting rights but no economic interests (where &#8220;economic interests&#8221; means the right to receive any distributions or dividends, whether cash or stock, in connection with common stock) and (ii) issue shares of Class B common stock to the Original SSE Equity Owners on a one-to-one basis with the number of LLC Interests they own; 

&#9642; 

We acquired, by merger, two entities that were owned by certain former indirect members of SSE Holdings ("Former SSE Equity Owners"), for which we issued 5,968,841 &#32;shares of Class A common stock as merger consideration (the "Mergers"). 

In August 2015, we completed a secondary offering of 4,000,000 &#32;shares of our Class A common stock at a price of $60.00 &#32;per share. All of the shares sold in the offering were offered by affiliates of the Former SSE Equity Owners and certain of the Continuing SSE Equity Owners (the "Selling Stockholders"). We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common stock offered by the Selling Stockholders. The shares sold in the offering consisted of (i) 844,727 &#32;existing shares of Class A common stock held by the Former SSE Equity Owners and (ii) 3,155,273 &#32;newly-issued shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with the redemption of 3,155,273 &#32;LLC Interests by the Continuing SSE Equity Owners that participated in the offering. Simultaneously, and in connection with the redemption, 3,155,273 &#32;shares of Class B common stock were surrendered by the Continuing SSE Equity Owners and canceled. Additionally, in connection with the redemption, we received 3,155,273 &#32;LLC Interests, increasing our total ownership interest in SSE Holdings. 

See Note 1 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more information about the above-mentioned transactions as well as the other transactions completed in connection with our IPO, which we refer to collectively as the "Organizational Transactions." As of December 30, 2015 , we owned 54.6% &#32;of SSE Holdings and the SSE Holdings members subsequent to the Merger (the "Continuing SSE Equity Owners") owned the remaining 45.4% &#32;of SSE Holdings.

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

Shake Shack is a modern day "roadside" burger stand serving a classic American menu of premium burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, frozen custard, crinkle cut fries, shakes, beer, wine and more. Originally, founded by Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group ("USHG"), which owns and operates some of New York City's most acclaimed and popular restaurants&#8212;Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Blue Smoke, The Modern at the Museum of Modern Art, Maialino, North End Grill, Untitled and Marta&#8212;Shake Shack originated as a hot dog cart in 2001 to support the rejuvenation of New York City's Madison Square Park through its Conservancy's first art installation, "I Y Taxi." The hot dog cart was an instant success, with lines forming daily throughout the summer months for the next three years. In response, the city's Department of Parks and Recreation awarded Shake Shack a contract to create a kiosk to help fund the park's future. In 2004, Shake Shack officially opened and immediately became a community gathering place for New Yorkers and visitors from all over the world and has since become a beloved New York City institution, garnering significant media attention, critical acclaim and a passionately-devoted following. Since its inception, Shake Shack has grown rapidly&#8212; with 84 &#32;Shacks, as of December 30, 2015 , in 10 &#32;countries and 45 cities&#8212;and we continue to expand outside our home market bringing our classic menu to new customers around the world. 

Shake Shack's fine dining heritage and commitment to community building, hospitality and the sourcing of premium ingredients have helped us pioneer what we believe is a new "fine casual" restaurant category. Fine casual couples the ease, value and convenience of fast casual concepts with the high standards of excellence grounded in fine dining: thoughtful ingredient sourcing and preparation, hospitality and quality. As a pioneer in this new category, we strive to maintain the culinary traditions of the classic American burger stand, while providing our guests with a menu of inspired food and drinks, made with carefully sourced and quality ingredients. 

THE SHACK PACT 

&#160; 

The Shack pact is the agreement that every employee makes at Shake Shack to lead our company with integrity, with purpose and with intention. It&#8217;s our mission and vision. Quite simply: it&#8217;s What We Do &#32;and Who We Are &#32;and it&#8217;s the ethos of our work each and every day as we grow Shake Shack. The Shack Pact &#8482; is prominently displayed in the team member areas of every Shack, on the inside cover of the Shackademics&#8482; book (our training manual) and acts as the template for every pre-meal meeting agenda (daily Shack team meeting). 

WHAT WE DO: 

We Stand For Something Good 

WHO WE ARE: 

We Are Boundless Hospitality 

&#9642; 

We follow the 5 Tenets of Enlightened Hospitality. 

&#9642; 

We smile a lot, listen closely and use every interaction to enrich our culture. 

&#9642; 

We always find the "yes" and write the next great chapter in real time. 

&#9642; 

The bigger we get, the smaller we act. 

&#9642; 

Our Culture of Enlightened Hospitality 

We take great pride in our culture and believe that it is the single most important factor in our success. Our mission to Stand For Something Good &#174; permeates throughout every Shack we build, ingredient we source and every team member we hire. We take care of each other first and foremost so that we can take care of our guests, our community, our suppliers and our investors. We aim to recruit people who have integrity, who are warm, friendly, motivated, caring, self-aware and intellectually curious&#8212;what we 

3 &#32;&#32;| Shake Shack Inc. &#32;&#32; Form 10-K 

call "51%'ers." We use the term "51%" to describe the inherent interpersonal and emotional skills needed to thrive on the job and "49%" to describe the technical skills needed for the job. Our 51%'ers are excited and committed to championship performance, remarkable and enriching hospitality, embodying our culture, and actively growing themselves and the brand. Danny Meyer's vision of Enlightened Hospitality&#8482; guided the creation of the unique Shake Shack culture that, we believe, creates a differentiated experience for our guests at each of our Shacks around the world. Our team is trained to understand and practice the values of Enlightened Hospitality: caring for each other, caring for our guests, caring for our community, caring for our suppliers and caring for our investors. These principles have been championed by Danny Meyer throughout his career and are detailed in his New York Times best-selling book Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business , and they are fundamental to the way we operate our business. 

The Bigger We Get, the Smaller We Act 

This mantra guides our decision-making and keeps us connected to where we came from. As we continue to grow, it's more important than ever that we cherish our roots, to continue the ethos that led to the creation of Shake Shack and to never veer from our original vision. We make decisions that focus on the core of who we are, staying true to our mission to Stand For Something Good, and the principles of Enlightened Hospitality. These principles drive us to seek out the finest team members, the tastiest ingredients, the best suppliers and the best community partners. 

We Are a Team - We Take Care of Each Other 

&#9642; 

We are 51%ers committed to championship performance. 

&#9642; 

We honor our schedules and commitments, arrive ready and leave only after packing parachutes. 

&#9642; 

We drive change to improve, and always offer solutions. 

&#9642; 

We communicate positively, give and receive constructive feedback, and constantly seek to develop ourselves while teaching others. 

&#9642; 

We balance fun and humor with respect, trust and integrity. 

&#9642; 

We compensate our teams with competitive pay, rich benefits and meaningful opportunities. 

&#9642; 

We have leaders who take on larger roles, travel the world and competitively earn Shackowledgments. 

Leaders Training Future Leaders 

We invest in our team through extensive leadership development programs to ensure that Shake Shack remains a great place to work and a real career choice for team members at every level. We have built a culture of active learning and we foster an environment of leadership development throughout the entire life cycle of employment. We seek to be the employer of choice by offering above industry average compensation in most markets, comprehensive benefits and a variety of incentive programs We believe that our culture of Enlightened Hospitality enables us to develop future leaders from within and deliver a consistent Shack experience as our team continues to grow. 

The goal of our training programs is to develop leaders and to cross-utilize team members throughout our operations. We call our team member life cycle, The Shacksperience &#8482;. This model clarifies and outlines growth opportunities at all levels of the organization and furthers our philosophy of hiring and developing 51%'ers, growing from within and "leaders training future leaders." We train our culture and guiding principles first, and then move to menu knowledge, followed by a focus on operational training. We believe that everyone learns differently and our training uses various formats: online interactive, video, hands-on and paper-based. Every team member has access to ShackSource , our proprietary online training portal, which is used not only as a learning platform, but also as a communication tool for our team. As an example, ShackSource &#8482; is a way for team members to send recognition messages, comments, praise and thanks to their fellow team members across the Company. 

We continually invest in our "Shack Team." We believe that team members who are treated and trained well will deliver Enlightened Hospitality and a superior guest experience. Through our leadership development program, The Shacksperience , we teach our team members the principles of Enlightened Hospitality and how to live and breathe our Shack Pact , the agreement that encompasses our value system and brand ethos. Our people make all the difference. 

We believe the unity that we have built amongst our Shack teams and across the Company as a whole is a key driver of our ability to deliver a great guest experience and, therefore, continue to successfully grow our footprint. Each Shack has a "Caught Doing 

Shake Shack Inc. &#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;Form 10-K &#32;&#32;| 4 

Right" board where team members are encouraged to post notes when they have witnessed other team members go above and beyond what is expected. At Shake Shack, we celebrate our successes, no matter how small, and this is practiced at every level of the Company. We also believe that team members will perform their best when they feel like the rest of the team is "on their side"-a belief ingrained in Shake Shack's DNA that began in the early stages of our fine dining history. 

We Are Fine Casual: Inspired Food and Drink 

&#9642; 

We cultivate our fine-dining roots and elevate classic roadside burger stand fare. 

&#9642; 

We responsibly source ingredients, and thoughtfully put them together to make delicious food. 

&#9642; 

We focus on our core menu while always innovating. 

&#9642; 

We balance speed of service with photo-ready presentation. 

&#9642; 

We collaborate with award-winning chefs, talented bakers, responsible growers and great like-minded companies. 

&#9642; 

We push to do what others are unwilling or unable to do. 

We embrace our fine-dining heritage and are committed to sourcing premium, sustainable ingredients, such as all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free beef, chicken and bacon, while offering excellent value to our guests. Our core menu remains focused, and is supplemented with targeted innovation inspired by the best versions of the classic American roadside burger stand. Always focused on culinary creativity and excellence, we collaborate with award-winning chefs, talented bakers, farmers and artisanal purveyors who work with us in different and engaging ways. We never stop looking for the best ingredients and the best culinary partners in order to exceed our guests' expectations in every aspect of their experience. 

Our signature items are our all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free burgers, hot dogs, crispy chicken, crinkle cut fries, shakes and frozen custard. We cook our burgers and spin our shakes to order and strive to use the freshest premium ingredients available.

Our Menu 

Our menu focuses on premium food and beverages, carefully crafted from a range of classic American foods at more accessible price points than full-service restaurants. Our domestic menu includes a variety of signature items, such as the ShackBurger &#174; , SmokeShack &#174; , Shack-cago Dog &#174; , 'Shroom Burger&#8482;, seasonal frozen custard, hand-spun shakes, concretes, ShackMeister &#174; &#32;Ale and Shack Red &#174; &#32;and Shack White &#174; &#32;wines. The Shake Shack concept and core menu items have not materially changed since 2004, which speaks to the timeless and universal appeal of our food offerings. 

Burgers &#38; Chicken 

Our burgers are made with a proprietary whole-muscle blend of 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free Angus beef, ground fresh daily, cooked to order and served on a non-GMO potato bun. We take great care in the preparation of our burgers, from sourcing to handling to cooking, to ensure that the taste and quality of the burgers we serve is second to none. Our signature burger is the ShackBurger, which is a four-ounce cheeseburger topped with lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce&#8482;. Our burger offering also includes the SmokeShack, 'Shroom Burger (our vegetarian burger), Shack Stack &#174; and Hamburger. In fiscal 2016, we launched our newest menu item, the Chick&#8217;n Shack&#8482;, which is an all-natural chicken breast, slow cooked in buttermilk herbs, hand battered, hand breaded and crisp-fried to order. It&#8217;s an incredibly exciting new menu addition and is attracting new guests and guests looking to try something different at Shake Shack. 

Crinkle Cut Fries 

Our classic and passionately loved crinkle cut fries are made from premium Yukon potatoes and are prepared 100% free of artificial trans-fat. Guests can also enjoy our Cheese Fries, which are our crinkle cut fries topped with a proprietary blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. We believe the tactile pleasure and emotional attachment that our guests have to the crispiness and ridges of our crinkle cut fries is a nostalgic ode to the roadside burger stand of yesteryear. 

Hot Dogs 

Shake Shack was born from a hot dog cart in 2001 and we believe that our hot dog category gives our guests another premium category from which to choose. Both our beef hot dogs and our chicken dogs are made from 100% all-natural, hormone and antibiotic-free beef and chicken, respectively. Our signature Shack-cago Dog is our nod to the classic Chicago-style hot dog, topped with Shack relish, onion, cucumber, pickle, tomato, sport pepper, celery salt and mustard. 

Frozen Custard 

Our premium, dense, rich and creamy ice cream, hand-spun daily on-site, is crafted from our proprietary vanilla and chocolate recipes using only real sugar&#8212;no corn syrup&#8212;and milk from dairy farmers who pledge not to use artificial growth hormones. Shakes remain our guests' favorite in this category and are scooped and spun to order. Our concretes are made by blending frozen custard at high speed with premium mix-ins. Since each Shake Shack intends to engage its community, each Shack has signature concretes, distinct to its location, and uses locally-sourced mix-ins made by artisanal producers whenever possible. Also, each week we feature a specialized custard with seasonally changing flavors, as part of our Shake of the Week program. 

Beer, Wine and Beverages 

Our proprietary ShackMeister Ale, brewed by Brooklyn Brewery, was specifically crafted to complement the flavor profile of a ShackBurger. At select locations we also offer local craft beers tailored to each Shack's geography. When it comes to wine, our Shack Red and Shack White, grown and bottled exclusively by Frog's Leap Vineyards in Napa Valley, accentuates our fine dining ethos and provide our guests with premium beverage options not commonly found in our industry. In addition, we serve draft Root Beer, seasonal freshly-squeezed lemonade, organic fresh brewed iced tea, cold brew coffee, organic apple juice and Shack 2 0 bottled water, from which 1% of the sales supports the cleanup of water sources around the world. 

Dogs Are Welcome Too 

We know that many dog owners treat their four-legged friends as family members. From our first Shack in Madison Square Park, we wanted to include dogs as part of the community gathering experience and developed the "Woof" section on our menu. ShackBurger dog biscuits, peanut butter sauce and vanilla custard make up our signature Pooch-ini &#174; , which is available at Shacks with an outdoor space. We also serve dog biscuits to-go, handcrafted exclusively for us by a New York-based bakery.

Culinary Innovation 

We continuously innovate around our core menu and our team is constantly experimenting with seasonal and local products, to enhance our menu, drive revenue and give our guests more reasons to keep coming back to Shake Shack. 

Shack-Wide Limited Time Offerings 

In fiscal 2015, we began a new LTO program where we featured a new premium burger for approximately six months. We will continue to supplement our core menu with targeted innovation inspired by the best versions of the classic American roadside burger stands. 

&#9642; 

ShackMeister Burger &#174; &#32;&#8212; Our winning entry at the 2014 Food Network South Beach Wine &#38; Food Festival Burger Bash, the ShackMeister Burger is a 100% all-natural Angus beef cheeseburger topped with crispy marinated shallots and ShackSauce. The ShackMeister Burger debuted in January 2015 and was extremely popular with our guests. 

&#9642; 

Roadside Shack&#8482; &#32;&#8212; In July 2015, the ShackMeister Burger rolled off our menus and we debuted the Roadside Shack, a 100% all-natural Angus beef cheeseburger topped with caramelized onions simmered in beer and bacon. 

&#9642; 

Shake of the Week &#8212; With the release of our new custard calendar in January 2015, we launched the Shake of the Week. Every single flavor of frozen custard can now be hand-spun into rich, creamy and deliciously dense shakes. The new custard calendar and Shake of the Week allow guests more opportunities to try each month's flavors and now offer more flavors of shakes than ever before. Additionally, during the 2015 holiday season, we launched three seasonal Shakes at all Shacks&#8212;Gingerbread, Chocolate Peppermint and Christmas Cookie, which were a huge hit and we intend to bring back in a similar format in 2016. 

Exclusive Offerings 

In addition to supplementing our menu with LTOs, we also seek to create new and exciting offerings that may inspired by local favorites or special events. Some of our exclusive offerings from fiscal 2015 include: 

&#9642; 

Chick'n Shack&#8482; &#32;&#8212; The Chick'n Shack is crafted from a 100% all-natural and antibiotic-free cage-free chicken breast slow-cooked in creamy buttermilk marinade, hand-dipped into Shack-made batter, dredged through seasoned flour and crisp-fried. It's topped with pickles, crisp shredded lettuce and a tangy Shack-made butttermilk herb mayo made with chives, parsley and thyme. The Chick'n Shack debuted in July 2015 and was offered exclusively at our three Brooklyn Shacks and we recently added it to the menu in January 2016 at all domestic company-operated Shacks, as well as certain international markets. 

&#9642; 

Lockhart Link Burger&#8482; &#32;&#8212; This Austin, Texas exclusive cheeseburger is topped with a griddled Kreuz Market jalapeno cheese sausage link, ShackSauce and pickles. 

&#9642; 

ParkBurger&#8482; &#32;&#8212; During the grand re-opening of our flagship Madison Square Park Shack in May 2015, we launched the ParkBurger, topped with cave-aged Jasper Hill Farm raw cow's milk cheese sauce and all-natural Niman Ranch applewood smoked bacon. The ParkBurger was available for a limited time exclusively at our Madison Square Park Shack. 

&#9642; 

Surf 'N' Shack &#8482; &#32; &#8212; Offered exclusively at our Boston and Connecticut Shacks during August and September of 2015, the Surf N' Shack is a 100% all-natural Angus hamburger topped with Maine lobster, lettuce, tomato and ShackSauce.

Chef Collaborations 

Our fine dining heritage has enabled Shake Shack to team up with some of the world's best chefs for short-term special menu items. We devote significant resources to menu innovation and are frequently invited to participate and compete in chef events such as the South Beach Wine and Food Festival's Burger Bash, which allows us to test out new creations that can often lead to the introduction of new items. Some of our more notable collaborations in fiscal 2015 include: 

&#9642; 

Carpetbagger Burger &#8212; To mark our one year anniversary in Atlanta, for one day only in September 2015, we teamed up with renowned restaurateur and chef Ford Fry to create the Carpetbagger Burger. Inspired by the carpetbagger steak, the Carpetbagger Burger is a butter-grilled double cheeseburger made with 100% all-natural Angus beef and topped with smoked and caramelized onions, house-made pickles, Comeback sauce and a crispy fried oyster. 

&#9642; 

wastED Juice Pulp Cheeseburger &#8212; To commemorate the reopening of our Madison Square Park Shack, we featured a limited-quantity special burger created by Chef Dan Barber, the wastED Juice Pulp Cheeseburger. This burger featured smashed leftover vegetable pulp from a cold-pressed juice operation and was topped with green leaf lettuce, melted cheese from Jasper Hill cheese trimmings, bruised beet ketchup and honey mustard mayo, all served on a re-purposed bread bun that incorporated a mash made from stale rye bread. 

&#9642; 

The Major Oak &#32;&#8212; In October 2015, for one day only, our Covent Garden Shack teamed up with Chef Sat Bains, founder of the Restaurant Sat Bains in Nottingham, England to create The Major Oak. Named after the famous English oak tree in the heart of Sherwood Forest, this burger was made with a custom-blended Aberdeen Angus beef patty, topped with fresh shallots, a slice of creamy blue Beauvale cheese and a touch of pine from the needles of local coniferous trees. Chef Bains also created a special forest-inspired ketchup made of seasonal "Penny Bun" mushrooms, as well as smoked mayo with a hint of charcoal from Sherwood Forest's red oaks. 

We Are A Warm Community Gathering Place 

&#8226; 

We thoughtfully design Shacks to mirror their distinct neighborhoods. 

&#8226; 

We engage with our community, inside and outside the Shack, in line and online. 

&#8226; 

We are a destination for little league champions, study sessions, birthdays, business meetings, run clubs, midday breaks, engagements, late-night hangs, first dates, fifth dates and family nights. 

&#8226; 

We keep our Shacks in tiptop shape, and they are clean and welcoming for new and returning guests. 

&#8226; 

We nurture and grow our beloved brand, create conversations and foster deep enriching relationships with our fans. 

Design Philosophy 

The design of our Shacks is critical to the Shake Shack experience and we blend our core brand identifiers with features specifically designed for each Shack to be of its place and connect directly with its neighborhood. Whether domestic or international, we are passionate about securing vibrant sites and creating unique designs that give each Shack a hand-crafted look, are locally focused, and are appropriate for their respective communities. A typical domestic company-operated Shack is between 3,000 and 3,500 square feet with interior seating for between 75 and 100 guests. Additionally, whenever possible, our domestic company-operated Shacks feature either outdoor seating or easy access to a park or green space. We use high-quality tactile materials, warm lighting that focuses on every table and highlights the textured walls and seating layouts that encourage guests to relax and stay for a while. We take great care to build each Shack with thoughtful architectural design, including forward-thinking structural features, and compelling eco-friendly touches, including a solar roof in a few of our free-standing Shacks&#8212;all while taking key inspiration from our first home in Madison Square Park. The original Shake Shack in Madison Square Park was designed by SITE Architecture and Design, led by James Wines and Denise Lee, in collaboration with Pentagram, led by Paula Scher. This design set the tone for a dynamic dialogue inside the park and our surrounding neighborhood that continues to drive our designs today. The overall atmosphere and design of our new Shacks evoke the very best from the design of the original park kiosk, as well as the best of the fine dining experience in terms of the quality of design, material used, lighting and music. We are mindful that each new Shack should embody the experience of the Madison Square Park Shake Shack-the line, the kiosk style, the experience of ordering food made just for you and the energetic open kitchen. 

Shake Shack Inc. &#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;Form 10-K &#32;&#32;| 8 

Each Shack is specifically designed to be of its place and connect with its neighborhood, but we have developed a number of iconic brand identifiers common to every Shack, including wrap-around steel beams, open kitchens, magnetic menu boards and tables made from reclaimed bowling lanes from Brooklyn. Although no two Shacks are alike, we believe that these brand identifiers key components to the expression of the brand and the experience of Shake Shack. 

Often during the construction of new Shacks, particularly those in new markets, we re-imagine the often uninspiring plywood walls that surround a construction site and use this space as a canvas to begin the process of introducing Shake Shack to the community prior to our opening. For instance, for our first Shack in California, we commissioned a public art piece, called the "Happy Wall," where passers-by could interact with the wall and create inspiring messages for the neighborhood. 

Today, we continue to evolve our timeless designs through a series of different designers from around the country. We continue to evolve certain prototypes, &#8220;classic&#8221; Shack designs, free-standing, in-line and unique, one of a kind formats. We are constantly pushing our design to be more creative and more nimble at the same time, allowing us to continue to ramp up our growth while making the Shack experience even more dynamic and accessible. 

Beloved Lifestyle Brand 

In our 12-year history, we have become a globally recognized brand with outsized consumer awareness relative to our current footprint of 84 Shacks, opening our first international Shack after only 7 domestic Shacks. Shake Shack has become a New York City institution, a vibrant and authentic community gathering place that delivers an unparalleled experience to our loyal guests and a broad, global demographic. Born in 2004, Shake Shack grew up alongside the emergence of social media and has benefited from an ongoing love affair with passionate fans who share their real-time experiences with friends. We aim to establish genuine connections with our guests and the communities in which they live. Shake Shack continues to be recognized in global media with impressions garnering attention well beyond our size. 

Shake Shack was born as the modern version of the old roadside burger stand during the birth of social media and the digital age. The premium positioning and brand voice, derived from the spirit, integrity and humor of Shake Shack, are reinforced by our contemporary, responsible designs and hospitable team members who Stand For Something Good; this identity anchors our marketing efforts. We believe that our guests appreciate the experience of coming to Shake Shack as a community gathering place and, thus, the heart of our marketing strategy is to communicate and connect with our guests both at our Shacks and through social media. 

Social Media 

Much like we design our Shacks to be community gathering places, we execute a social media strategy that creates an online, on-brand community gathering place. Our guests and fans easily connect with us through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr and Pinterest. We recognize the impact of social media on today's consumers and we use these platforms to share information with our guests about new menu items, new Shack openings and other relevant Shake Shack information. As of December 30, 2015 , we had approximately 166,000 Facebook fans, 231,000 Instagram followers, and 50,000 Twitter followers. We communicate with our fans in creative and organic ways that both strengthen our connection with them and increase brand awareness. In June 2015, we ranked #9 on Restaurant Social Media Index's top 250 restaurant brands, which is measured on influence, sentiment and engagement. 

Community and Charitable Partners (Shack Gives Back) 

Each Shack focuses on conveying a consistent national brand message while also tailoring marketing efforts to each Shack. We always have menu items that feature local ingredients and beers that are specific to each Shack's community. We also aim marketing efforts at local events which help position Shake Shack as a premium brand that is connected to its neighborhood through participating in local celebrations and developing relationships within the community. For instance, we recently teamed up with Jerod Mayo of the New England Patriots and a local Boston-area bakery to create "Mayo's LineShacker," a limited edition shake available only at our Boston Shacks, with 100% of the proceeds benefiting the Boston Medical Center. Outside of local events, each Shack has a local charity partner to which it donates 5% of the sales from one regionally-themed concrete. The Shack in Miami Beach, for instance, features the "Vice Crispy Treat," and donates 5% of this item's sales to the Miami Children's Hospital.

Shack-wide Events 

Shake Shack promotes annual events and limited-time offers to drive repeat visits and build intrigue among staff and guests. Shacktoberfest, for example, is Shake Shack's ode to traditional Oktoberfest in which special sausages, beers and desserts are added to the menu for a 10-day period in the fall. 

Since 2012, Shake Shack has held The Great American Shake Sale during the month of May to raise money and awareness for childhood hunger. During The Great American Shake Sale, we encourage guests to donate $2 in exchange for a free cake-themed shake (a $5 value) at their next visit. 100% of these donations go directly to Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry campaign. In May 2015, we raised $504,000 across our domestic company-operated Shacks for this initiative. 

Product Placement 

Shake Shack has been fortunate to receive considerable product placement in movies, TV shows and other media without any cost to the Company. In fact, Shake Shack has been able to charge fees for these location shoots, which have included scenes from the motion pictures Something Borrowed and Tower Heist , as well as the acclaimed HBO series The Newsroom &#32;and Showtime's Billions . We have also been featured in segments on The Daily Show , Saturday Night Live , CBS Sunday Morning and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon .

Our brand power and thoughtful approach to growth have resulted in strong Shack performance across a variety of geographic areas and formats. During the three-year period ended December 30, 2015 , we grew from 21 Shacks to 84 &#32;Shacks spanning 12 states, the District of Columbia and 10 countries, representing a 59% &#32;compound annual growth rate ("CAGR"). As a result, our total revenue grew from $57.0 million in fiscal 2012 &#32;to $190.6 million in fiscal 2015 , a 50% &#32;CAGR. Compared to fiscal 2014 , total revenue increased 60.8%.

Shack system-wide sales includes combined revenue from all of our domestic company-operated Shacks and our domestic and international licensed Shacks. Our total revenue is limited to Shack sales from domestic company-operated Shacks and licensing revenue from our domestic and international licensed Shacks. 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented, with restaurants competing on factors such as taste, price, food quality, service, location and the ambience and condition of the restaurant. Our primary competitors include "better burger" concept restaurants, as well as other fast casual restaurants, and, to a lesser extent, quick service and casual dining restaurants. Our competition includes multi-unit national and regional chains, as well as a wide variety of locally-owned restaurants. Our competitors may operate company-owned restaurants, franchised restaurants or some combination. Many of our competitors offer breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. We may also compete with companies outside of the traditional restaurant industry, such as grocery store chains and delicatessens, especially those that target customers who seek high-quality food, as well as convenience food stores, cafeterias and other dining outlets. Our competition continues to intensify as new competitors enter both the burger and fast casual segments. We also face increasing competitive pressures from some of our competitors who have recently announced initiatives to offer better quality ingredients, such as antibiotic-free meat. For more information regarding the risks we face from our competitors, who may have, among other things, a more diverse menu, greater financial resources, lower operating costs, a more well-established brand, better locations and more effective marketing than we do, see "Risks Related to Operating in the Restaurant Industry&#8212;We face significant competition for guests, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business could be adversely affected" in Item 1A, Risk Factors . 

We specifically target guests that seek an engaging and differentiated guest experience that includes great food, unique and thoughtful integration with local communities and high standards of excellence and hospitality. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our market position, as we believe consumers will continue to trade up to higher quality offerings given the increasing consumer focus on responsible sourcing, ingredients and preparation. Additionally, we believe that consumers will continue to move away from the added time commitment and cost of traditional casual dining. We believe that many consumers want to associate with brands whose ethos matches that of their own, and that Shake Shack, with our mission to Stand For Something Good and our culture of Enlightened Hospitality, is a distinct and differentiated global lifestyle brand.

GROWTH STRATEGIES 

&#160; 

We believe that we are well-positioned to achieve significant, sustainable financial growth. We plan to continue to expand our business, drive Shack sales and enhance our competitive positioning by executing on the following strategies: 

Opening New Domestic Company-Operated Shacks 

This is where our greatest immediate opportunity for growth lies. We waited nearly five years to open our second Shack, and we are still in the very nascent stage of our story, with only 44 domestic company-operated and five &#32;domestic licensed Shacks 12 in states and Washington, D.C. as of December 30, 2015 . We believe there is tremendous whitespace opportunity to expand in both existing and new U.S. markets, and we have invested in the infrastructure that will enable us to continue to grow rapidly and with discipline. In fiscal 2015 , we significantly expanded our domestic company-operated footprint by opening 13 new Shacks representing a 41.9% increase in our domestic company-operated Shack count. We plan to open at least 14 new domestic company-operated Shacks each year for the foreseeable future. We believe that over the long-term we have the potential to grow our current domestic company-operated Shack footprint to at least 450 Shacks by opening domestic company-operated Shacks in new and existing markets. The rate of future Shack growth in any particular period is inherently uncertain and is subject to numerous factors that are outside of our control. As a result, we do not currently have an anticipated timeframe for such expansion. We believe we have a versatile real estate model built for growth. We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strength of our business model and our significant brand awareness to successfully develop new Shacks in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new and existing, as well as small and large markets. As we grow, we will continue to live by one principle to ensure the success of both our new and existing restaurants: "The Bigger We Get, The Smaller We Need To Act." This mantra is central to our Stand For Something Good vision and encompasses our commitment to continue to make decisions that focus on the core of who we are, staying true to the principles of Enlightened Hospitality. 

We will continue to expand in existing markets (New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, Texas and South Florida) in order to leverage operational effectiveness as we cluster in these high-density markets, but also will enter new markets, such as Arizona, California and Minnesota. With only 84 Shacks around the world (as of December 30, 2015), we have identified many attractive and differentiated markets for the Shake Shack experience. In major metropolitan areas, we seek locations where communities gather, often with characteristics such as high foot traffic, substantial commercial density, reputable co-tenants and other traffic drivers such as proximity to parks, museums, schools, hospitals and tourist attractions. For every potential domestic company-operated Shack we consider, we apply rigorous financial metrics to ensure we maintain our targeted profitability. Our flexible model allows us to design our Shacks so that we can pursue a variety of property types. We have successfully launched Shacks with different layouts and sizes in varied locations throughout urban high density areas, suburban in-line and pad sites, regional malls, outlet malls, lifestyle centers, ballparks, airports and train stations. With a disciplined approach to new Shack development and a successful track record in site selection, we believe we are positioned well for future growth. 

Capitalizing on Our Outsized Brand Awareness 

One of the great advantages for Shake Shack has been our birthplace and headquarters in New York City. Rarely has a brand of our type been born in New York, and this gives us a tremendous media and brand power. The Shake Shack experience has cultivated significant brand awareness relative to the small number of Shacks we operate. We have worked tirelessly to establish a genuine connection with our guests and integrate into their communities through investment in innovative marketing and programming. We utilize various social media outlets to actively engage with our growing online following. In June 2015, we ranked #9 on Restaurant Social Media Index's top 250 restaurant brands, which is measured on influence, sentiment and engagement. Furthermore, we believe that our press and media impressions and industry recognition are a testament to the strength of our brand. We were named one of "The 25 Most Innovative Consumer and Retail Brands" in 2014 by Entrepreneur.com , ranked #7 in The Daily Meal's &#32;"101 Best Restaurants in America" for 2015, and were the winner of the 2013 "Most Loved Brand of the Year" from the RIZMY Awards, "Best Burger" at the 2014 South Beach Wine and Food Festival's Burger Bash and more. Additionally, we give back to the communities in which we operate, and strengthen awareness for philanthropic causes such as Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry campaign. Our marketing efforts focus on interacting with our guests in an authentic, innovative manner which creates memorable, meaningful experiences. The experience that we provide for our guests and local communities has generated a growing loyal following who 

Shake Shack Inc. &#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;Form 10-K &#32;&#32;| 12 

promote our brand through word-of-mouth. We believe that this outsized brand awareness will continue to fuel our growth in existing and new markets. 

Growing Same-Shack Sales 

Given the significant awareness of our brand and the excitement we have been able to generate for our market launches, our Shacks have generally opened with higher volumes and operating profits relative to their second year, following the strong initial honeymoon period. In year three, our Shacks generally mature and continue to grow from the second year base and then retain these higher volumes over time. We expect our Shacks to deliver low same-Shack sales growth for the foreseeable future as the number of new Shack openings relative to our comparable Shack base remains our primary driver of growth. We do, however, continually focus on improving our same-Shack sales performance by providing an engaging and differentiated guest experience that includes new seasonal and Shack-specific offerings, unique and thoughtful integration with local communities and high standards of excellence and hospitality. We will continue to innovate around our core menu to keep our offerings fresh, while remaining focused on our signature items. 

Opportunistically Increasing Our Licensed Shacks 

We will continue to grow our licensed portfolio by expanding further domestically, in the countries in which we currently have internationally licensed operations, as well as entering new international markets. This strategy historically has been a low-cost, high-return method of growing our brand awareness and providing an increasing source of cash flow. In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive licensing arrangement with a leading retail and food operator for the development of up to 10 new Shacks in Japan over the next five years. We opened our first Shack in Tokyo, Japan in November 2015 in the renowned Meiji-Jingu Park. This opening was a true demonstration of the strength of the Shake Shack brand outside of our core international markets, as guests were camped out overnight, with over 400 people on line when the doors opened. In December 2015, we announced plans to enter South Korea with a new licensed partner for the development of 25 Shacks over the next 10 years. We believe there are additional international markets that will embrace the Shake Shack concept. Given our position in New York and the success of our current licensed Shacks at home and abroad, we continue to attract substantial interest from potential international licensees around the world and we believe we have significant opportunities to expand our licensing footprint in existing and new international markets as our team, development opportunities and supply chain matures. 

OPERATIONS 

&#160; 

Sourcing and Supply Chain 

Shake Shack has always been committed to working with best-in-class suppliers, artisanal purveyors and cattle ranchers. Our Stand For Something Good vision guides us in how we source and develop our ingredients, always looking for the best ways to provide top quality food at an excellent value and accessible to all. We pride ourselves on sourcing premium ingredients from like-minded producers&#8212;all natural proteins, vegetarian fed, humanely raised and source verified, with no hormones or antibiotics. 

We have a regional strategy for ground beef production to ensure that we are always serving freshly ground and never frozen beef. We have had the same butcher for the New York City metropolitan area, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Shacks since opening our first Shack, which helped create our proprietary beef blend. We will continue to partner with and develop regional suppliers in new markets as we grow. 

We have a limited number of suppliers for our major ingredients, including beef patties, potato buns, custard, Portobello mushrooms and cheese sauce. In fiscal 2015 , we purchased all of our (i) ground beef patties from five suppliers, with approximately 76% of our ground beef patties supplied by one supplier, (ii) potato buns directly from one supplier, (iii) custard base from one supplier, (iv) 'Shroom Burgers from two suppliers, with approximately 67% of our 'Shroom Burgers supplied by one supplier and (v) ShackSauce from two suppliers, with approximately 92% of our ShackSauce supplied by one supplier. We have developed a reliable supply chain and continue to focus on identifying alternative sources to avoid any possible interruptions of service and product.

Distribution 

We contract with one distributor, which we refer to as our "broadline" distributor, to provide virtually all of our food distribution services in the United States. As of December 30, 2015 , approximately 88% of our core food and beverage ingredients and 100% of our paper goods and chemicals, collectively representing approximately 45% of our purchases, were processed through our broadline distributor for distribution and delivery to each Shack. As of December 30, 2015 , we were utilizing 10 affiliated distribution centers to supply our domestic company-operated Shacks. We recognize that the safety and consistency of our products begins with our suppliers. Suppliers must meet certain criteria and strict quality control standards in the production and delivery of our food and other products. We regularly evaluate our broadline distributor to ensure that the products we purchase conform to our standards and that the prices they offer are competitive. 

Food Safety and Quality Assurance 

Food safety is a top priority and w e are committed to serving safe, high quality food. We have rigorous quality assurance and food safety protocols in place throughout our supply chain. We have a comprehensive supplier and ingredient selection process and maintain a limited list of approved suppliers. We thoroughly review the results of suppliers' internal and external quality audits, insurance coverage and track record on an ongoing basis. We have a food safety site inspection process and periodically perform supplier site visits, as well as mock food recalls. We have developed and implemented training and operating standards related to the food preparation, cleanliness and safety in the Shacks. We also have a dedicated Quality Assurance team to ensure food safety across all domestic company-operated Shacks. 

Site Selection 

Shake Shack is ultimately about the guest experience and our site selection focuses on choosing great sites where people want to be together. Our site selection process is actively led by our Real Estate Committee, which meets regularly and follows a detailed approval process to ensure quality, fiduciary responsibility and overall adherence to the Company's strategic growth goals. We invest in analytical tools for extensive demographic analysis and data collection for both existing and new potential sites. In addition to our in-house team of experienced real estate professionals, we use a national real estate broker to manage a network of regional brokers in order to leverage external resources in pursuit of pipeline development and consistent deal flow. 

Construction 

A typical Shack takes between 14 and 16 weeks to build. We expect that the cost to build a new Shack will range from approximately $1.2 to $2.7 million, with an average near-term build cost of approximately $2.0 million, excluding pre-opening costs. We use a number of general contractors on a regional basis and employ a mixed approach of bidding and strategic negotiation in order to ensure the best value and highest quality construction. 

Management Information Systems 

Our domestic company-operated Shacks use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems created by NCR Corporation, which we believe are scalable to support our growth plans. These point-of-sale systems are designed specifically for the restaurant industry and we use many customized features to increase operational effectiveness, internal communication and data analysis. This system provides a touch screen interface, graphical order confirmation display, touch screen kitchen display and integrated, high-speed credit card and gift card processing. The point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales, product mix and average transaction size. 

Our back-office computer systems are designed to assist in the management of our domestic company-operated Shacks and provide real-time labor and food cost management tools. These tools provide the home office and operations management quick access to detailed business data and reduces the amount time spent by our Shack-level managers on administrative needs. The systems provide our Shack-level managers the ability to submit orders electronically with our distribution network. The system also supplies sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department on a daily basis. We use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures, as well as preliminary weekly detailed profit and loss statements for each Shack with final reports following the end of each period.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160; 

Since our inception, we have undertaken to strategically and proactively develop our intellectual property portfolio by registering our trademarks and service marks worldwide. As of December 30, 2015 , we had 19 registered marks domestically, including registrations in our core marks ("Shake Shack," "Shack Burger," " " and " ") and certain other marks, such as Stand for Something Good. Internationally, we have registered our core marks in over 80 countries spanning six continents. These marks are registered in multiple international trademark classes, including for restaurant services, food services, non-alcoholic beverages and apparel. We also own the domain www.shakeshack.com as well as over 80 other domain names for use in other markets. 

In addition, we have agreements with the suppliers of our proprietary products stating that the recipes and production processes associated with those products are our property, confidential to us, and may not be provided to any other customer. Our proprietary products include the burger recipe for our whole muscle blend and the patty grinding procedure and the product formulations for our ShackSauce, 'Shroom Burger, chicken breast, chicken breader and buttermilk herb mayo, cheese sauce, unflavored custard base, chocolate custard base, and certain toppings and custard mix-ins. We also have exclusive arrangements with our suppliers of ShackMeister Ale, Shack Red wine, Shack White wine, all-natural hot dog and all-natural chicken sausage, relish and cherry peppers. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

&#160; 

We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements, including those related to, among others, nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements, food safety regulations, local licensure, building and zoning regulations, employment regulations and laws and regulations related to our licensed operations. New laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties. See "Regulatory and Legal Risks" in Item 1A, Risk Factors &#32;for more information. 

We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have materially affected, or are reasonably expected to materially affect, our results of operations, competitive position, or capital expenditures. 

SEASONALITY 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in that our Shack sales are typically nominally higher during the summer months, affecting our second and third quarters in a fiscal year.
