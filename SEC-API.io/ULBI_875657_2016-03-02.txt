Military applications for our non-rechargeable HiRate&#174; batteries include: man-pack and survival radios, night vision devices, targeting devices, chemical agent monitors and thermal imaging equipment. Our lithium thionyl chloride batteries, sold under our ABLE and Ultralife brands as well as a private label brand, are used in a variety of applications including utility meters, wireless security devices, electronic meters, automotive electronics and geothermal devices. We believe that the chemistry of lithium batteries provides significant advantages over other currently available non-rechargeable battery technologies. These advantages include: higher energy density, lighter weight, longer operating time, longer shelf life and a wider operating temperature range. Our non-rechargeable batteries also have relatively flat voltage profiles, which provide stable power. Conventional non-rechargeable batteries, such as alkaline batteries, have sloping voltage profiles that result in decreasing power output during discharge. While the price of our lithium batteries is generally higher than alkaline batteries, the increased energy per unit of weight and volume of our lithium batteries allow for longer operating times and less frequent battery replacements for our targeted applications. 

&#160; 

We believe that our ability to design and produce lightweight, high-energy lithium ion rechargeable batteries and charging systems in a variety of custom sizes, shapes, and thicknesses offers substantial benefits to our customers. We market lithium ion rechargeable batteries comprising cells manufactured by qualified cell manufacturers. Our rechargeable products can be used in a wide variety of applications including communications, medical and other portable electronic devices. Our Multi-Kilowatt Module lithium ion battery system is a large format battery utilizable for energy storage, battery back-up, and remote power applications. We believe that t he chemistry of our lithium ion batteries provides significant advantages over other currently available rechargeable batteries. These advantages include: higher energy density, lighter weight, longer operating time, longer time between charges and a wider operating temperature range. Conventional rechargeable batteries such as nickel metal hydride and nickel cadmium are heavier, have lower energy and require more frequent charging.

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Within this segment, we also seek to fund the development of new products that we hope will advance our technologies through contracts with both government agencies and private sector third parties. 

&#160;

We continue to obtain development contracts for intellectual property that we believe will enhance our efforts to commercialize new products that we develop. Revenues in this segment that pertain to technology contracts may vary widely each year, depending upon the quantity and size of contracts obtained. 

&#160; 

Revenues for this segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $65,272 and segment contribution (gross profit) was $18,698.

&#160; 

History 

&#160; 

Ultralife was formed as a Delaware corporation in December 1990. In March 1991, we acquired certain technology and assets from Eastman Kodak Company (&#34;Kodak&#34;) relating to its 9-volt lithium manganese dioxide non-rechargeable battery. In December 1992, we completed our initial public offering and became listed on NASDAQ. 

&#160; 

In May 2006, we acquired ABLE New Energy Co., Ltd. (&#8220;ABLE&#8221;), an established manufacturer of lithium batteries located in Shenzhen, China, which broadened our product offering, including a wide range of lithium-thionyl chloride and lithium-manganese batteries, and provided additional exposure to new consumer markets.

&#160;

In July 2006, we finalized the acquisition of substantially all the assets of McDowell Research, Ltd. (&#8220;McDowell&#8221;), a manufacturer of military communications accessories located originally in Waco, Texas. We relocated its operations to our Newark, New York facility during the second half of 2007, which enhanced our channels into the military communications area and strengthened our presence in global defense markets. In January 2012, we relocated these operations to our Virginia Beach, Virginia facility in order to gain operational efficiencies.

&#160;

In March 2008, we formed a joint venture, named Ultralife Batteries India Private Limited (&#8220;India JV&#8221;), with our distributor partner in India. The India JV assembles Ultralife power solution products and manages local sales and marketing activities, serving commercial, government and defense customers throughout India. We have invested cash into the India JV, as consideration for our 51% ownership stake in the India JV.

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In March 2009, we acquired the tactical communications products business of Science Applications International Corporation. The tactical communications products business (&#8220;AMTI&#8221;) designs, develops and manufactures tactical communications products including: amplifiers, man-portable systems, cables, power solutions and ancillary communications equipment, which are sold by Ultralife under the brand name AMTI. The acquisition strengthened our communications systems business and provided us with direct entry into the handheld radio/amplifier market, complementing Ultralife&#8217;s communications systems offerings.

&#160;

In January 2016, we acquired Accutronics Limited (&#8220;Accutronics&#8221;), a U.K. corporation based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, U.K., a leading independent designer and manufacturer of smart batteries and charger systems for high-performance, feature-laden portable and handheld electronic devices. With a portfolio encompassing custom battery design, development and manufacturing for OEM&#8217;s; standard smart batteries, chargers and accessories; and pre-engineered batteries and power solutions for specific applications, Accutronics primarily serves the portable medical device market throughout Europe. Medical applications include digital imaging, ventilators, anesthesia, endoscopy, patient monitoring, cardio pulmonary care, oxygen concentration and aspiration. We acquired Accutronics to advance our strategy of commercial revenue diversification, to expand our geographical penetration, and to achieve revenue growth from new product development. We expect substantial sales synergies between Accutronics and our existing commercial battery business as we cross-sell our existing products and acquired Accutronics&#8217; products to our respective customer bases.

&#160;

Products, Services and Technology 

&#160;

Battery &#38; Energy Products 

&#160; 

A non-rechargeable battery is used until discharged and then replaced. The principal competing non-rechargeable battery technologies are carbon zinc, alkaline and lithium. We manufacture a range of non-rechargeable battery products based on lithium manganese dioxide, lithium manganese carbon mono-fluoride hybrid, and lithium thionyl chloride technologies.

&#160;

We believe that the chemistry of lithium batteries provides significant advantages over currently available non-rechargeable battery technologies, which include: lighter weight, longer operating time, longer shelf life, and a wider operating temperature range. Our non-rechargeable batteries also have relatively flat voltage profiles, which provide stable power. Conventional non-rechargeable batteries, such as alkaline batteries, have sloping voltage profiles that result in decreasing power during discharge. While the prices for our lithium batteries are generally higher than commercially available alkaline batteries produced by others, we believe that the increased energy per unit of weight and volume of our batteries will allow longer operating time and less frequent battery replacements for our targeted applications. As a result, we believe that our non-rechargeable batteries are priced competitively with other battery technologies on a price per unit of energy or volume basis. 

&#160;

Our non-rechargeable products include the following product configurations: 

&#160; 

9-Volt Lithium Battery. Our 9-volt lithium battery delivers a unique combination of the highest available energy density and stable voltage, which results in a longer operating life for the battery and, accordingly, fewer battery replacements. While our 9-volt battery price is generally higher than conventional 9-volt carbon zinc and alkaline batteries, we believe the enhanced operating performance and decreased costs associated with battery replacement make our 9-volt battery more cost effective than conventional batteries on a cost per unit of energy or volume basis when used in a variety of applications. 

&#160; 

We market our 9-volt lithium batteries to OEM, distributor and retail markets including industrial electronics, safety and security, and medical. Typical applications include: smoke alarms, wireless alarm systems, bone growth stimulators, telemetry devices, blood analyzers, ambulatory infusion pumps and parking meters. A significant portion of the sales of our 9-volt battery is to major smoke alarm OEMs for use in their long-life smoke alarms. We also manufacture our 9-volt lithium battery under private label for a variety of companies. Additionally, we sell our 9-volt battery to the broader consumer market through national and regional retail chains and Internet retailers. 

&#160; 

Our current 9-volt battery manufacturing capacity is adequate to meet forecasted customer demand over the next three years. 

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Cylindrical Batteries. Featuring high energy, wide temperature range, long shelf life and operating life, our cylindrical cells and batteries, based on lithium manganese dioxide, lithium manganese dioxide carbon monoflouride hybrid and lithium thionyl chloride technologies, represent some of the most advanced lithium power sources currently available. We market a wide range of cylindrical non-rechargeable lithium cells and batteries in various sizes under both the Ultralife HiRate and ABLE brands. These include: D, C, 5/4 C, 1/2 AA, 2/3 A and other sizes, which are sold individually as well as packaged into multi-cell battery packs, including our leading BA-5390 military battery, an alternative to the competing Li-SO 2 BA-5590 battery, and one of the most widely used battery types in the U.S. armed forces for portable applications. Our BA-5390 battery provides 50% to 100% more energy (mission time) than the BA-5590, and it is used in approximately 60 military applications . With the introduction of our lithium carbon mono-fluoride hybrid chemistry, we now offer a D-cell that has 100% more energy than the competing Li-SO 2 D-cell. 

&#160; 

We market our line of lithium cells and batteries to the OEM market for commercial, defense, medical, asset tracking and search and rescue applications, among others. Significant commercial applications include pipeline inspection equipment, automatic reclosers and oceanographic devices. Asset tracking applications include RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems. Among the defense uses are manpack radios, night vision goggles, chemical agent monitors and thermal imaging equipment. Medical applications include: AED&#8217;s (Automated External Defibrillators), infusion pumps and telemetry systems. Search and rescue applications include: ELT&#8217;s (Emergency Locator Transmitters) for aircraft and EPIRB&#8217;s (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons) for ships.

&#160;

Thin Cell Batteries. We manufacture a range of thin lithium manganese dioxide batteries under the Thin Cell &#174; brand. Thin Cell batteries are flat, lightweight batteries providing a unique combination of high energy, long shelf life, wide operating temperature range and very low profile. We are currently marketing these batteries to OEMs for applications such as displays, wearable medical devices, toll passes, theft detection systems, and RFID devices. 

&#160; 

In contrast to non-rechargeable batteries, after a rechargeable battery is discharged, it can be recharged and reused many times. Generally, discharge and recharge cycles can be repeated hundreds or thousands of times in rechargeable batteries, but the achievable number of cycles (cycle life) varies among technologies and is an important competitive factor. All rechargeable batteries experience a small, but measurable, loss in energy with each cycle. The industry commonly reports cycle life in the number of cycles a battery can achieve until 80% of the battery's initial energy capacity remains. In the rechargeable battery market, the principal competing technologies are nickel cadmium, nickel metal hydride and lithium ion (including lithium polymer) batteries. Rechargeable batteries are used in many applications, such as military radios, laptop computers, mobile telephones, portable medical devices, wearable devices and many other commercial, defense and consumer products. 

&#160; 

Three important performance characteristics of a rechargeable battery are design flexibility, energy density and cycle life. Design flexibility refers to the ability of rechargeable batteries to be designed to fit a variety of shapes and sizes of battery compartments. Thin profile batteries with prismatic geometry provide the design flexibility to fit the battery compartments of today's electronic devices. Energy density refers to the total amount of electrical energy stored in a battery divided by the battery&#8217;s weight and volume as measured in watt-hours per kilogram and watt-hours per liter, respectively. High energy density batteries generally are longer lasting power sources providing longer operating time and necessitating fewer battery recharges. High energy density and long achievable cycle life are important characteristics for comparing rechargeable battery technologies. Greater energy density will permit the use of batteries of a given weight or volume for a longer time period. Accordingly, greater energy density will enable the use of smaller and lighter batteries with energy comparable to those currently marketed. Lithium ion batteries, by the nature of their electrochemical properties, are capable of providing higher energy density than comparably sized batteries that utilize other chemistries and, therefore, tend to consume less volume and weight for a given energy content. Long achievable cycle life, particularly in combination with high energy density, is suitable for applications requiring frequent battery recharges, such as cellular telephones and laptop computers, and allows the user to charge and recharge many times before noticing a difference in performance. We believe that our lithium ion batteries generally have some of the highest energy density and longest cycle life available. 

&#160;

Lithium Ion Cells and Batteries. We market a variety of lithium ion cells and rechargeable batteries comprising cells manufactured by qualified cell manufacturers. These products are used in a wide variety of applications including communications, medical and other portable electronic devices. 

&#160; 

8&#160;

&#160;

Battery Charging Systems and Accessories. To provide our customers with complete power system solutions, we offer a wide range of rugged military and commercial battery charging systems and accessories including smart chargers, multi-bay charging systems and a variety of cables. 

&#160; 

Multi-Kilowatt Module. Our Multi-Kilowatt Module lithium ion battery system is a large format battery utilizable for energy storage, battery back-up, and remote power applications. This product is a direct replacement of 2.5 kWh and greater lead acid batteries in 24V or 48V applications. It can be connected in multiples to obtain higher-voltages and is capable of over 3,000 cycles while maintaining 80% of its capacity. 

&#160; 

Technology Contracts. Our technology contract activities involve the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products through contracts with both government agencies and other private sector third parties. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing

&#160; 

We employ a staff of sales and marketing personnel in North America, Europe and Asia. We sell our products and services directly to commercial customers, including OEMs, as well as government and defense agencies in the U.S. and abroad and have contractual arrangements with sales agents who market our products on a commission basis in defined territories. While OEM agreements and contracts contain volume-based pricing based on expected volumes, industry practices dictate that pricing is rarely adjusted retroactively when contract volumes are not achieved. Every effort is made to adjust future prices accordingly, but the ability to adjust prices is generally based on market conditions. 

&#160; 

9&#160;

&#160;

We also distribute some of our products through domestic and international distributors and retailers. Our sales are generated primarily from customer purchase orders. We have several long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers. These contracts do not commit the customers to specific purchase volumes, nor to specific timing of purchase order releases, and they include fixed price agreements over various periods of time . In general we do not believe our sales are seasonal, although we may sometimes experience seasonality for some of our military products based on the timing of government fiscal budget expenditures. 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our business comes from sales of products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments through various contracts. These contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations that specify policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services. The regulations also contain guidelines for managing contracts after they are awarded, including conditions under which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the government&#8217;s convenience or for default. Failure to comply with the procurement laws or regulations can result in civil, criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines, penalties, suspension of payments, or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. 

&#160; 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had one major customer, a large defense primary contractor, which comprised 24% and 18% of our revenues, respectively, in each year. There were no other customers that comprised greater than 10% of our total revenues during these years. 

&#160; 

In 2015, sales to U.S. and non-U.S. customers were approximately $46,700 and $ 29,700, respectively. In 2014, sales to U.S. and non-U.S. customers were approximately $39,400 and $27,100, respectively. For more information relating to revenues by country for the last two fiscal years and long-lived assets for the last two fiscal years by country of origin, see Note 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Battery &#38; Energy Products 

&#160; 

We target sales of our non-rechargeable products to manufacturers of security and safety equipment, medical devices, search and rescue equipment, specialty instruments, point of sale equipment and metering applications, as well as users of military equipment. Our strategy is to develop sales and marketing alliances with OEMs and governmental agencies that utilize our batteries in their products, commit to cooperative research and development or marketing programs, and recommend our products for design-in or replacement use in their products. We are addressing these markets through direct contact by our sales and technical personnel, use of sales agents and stocking distributors, manufacturing under private label and promotional activities. 

&#160; 

We seek to capture a significant market share for our products within our targeted OEM markets, which we believe, if successful will result in increased product awareness and sales at the end-user or consumer level. We are also selling our 9-volt battery to the consumer market through retail distribution through a number of national retailers. Most military procurements are done directly by the specific government organizations requiring products, based on a competitive bidding process. For those military procurements that are not bid, the procurements are typically subject to an audit of the product&#8217;s underlying cost structure and associated profitability. Additionally, we are typically required to successfully meet contractual specifications and to pass various qualifications testing for the products under contract by the military. An inability by us to pass these tests for our new products in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on future growth prospects. When a government contract is awarded, there is a government procedure that allows for unsuccessful companies to formally protest the award if they believe they were unjustly treated in the government&#8217;s bid evaluation process. A prolonged delay in the resolution of a protest, or a reversal of an award resulting from such a protest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

We market our products to defense organizations in the U.S. and other countries. These efforts have resulted in us winning significant contracts. In September 2010, we were awarded a production contract by the Defense Logistics Agency for up to five years, with a maximum total potential of $42,100, to provide our BA-5390 non-rechargeable lithium manganese dioxide batteries to the U.S. military. Production deliveries began in the first quarter of 2011. Through the completion of the contract in September 2015, we shipped BA-5390 batteries totaling $10,000. Subsequent to the completion of the contract, we continued to receive orders for BA-5390 batteries from the Defense Logistics Agency that we shipped in 2015 and that are planned for shipment in 2016.

&#160;

10&#160;

&#160;

We target sales of our lithium ion rechargeable batteries and charging systems to OEM customers, as well as distributors and resellers focused on our target markets. We respond to RFPs to design products for OEMs, and believe that our design capabilities, product characteristics and solution integration will drive OEMs to incorporate our batteries into their product offerings, resulting in revenue growth opportunities for us. 

&#160; 

We continue to expand our marketing activities as part of our strategic plan to increase sales of our rechargeable products for commercial, standby, defense and communications applications, as well as hand-held devices, wearable devices and other electronic portable equipment. A key part of this expansion includes increasing our design and assembly capabilities as well as building our network of distributors and value added distributors throughout the world. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our backlog related to Battery &#38; Energy Products was approximately $18,500 and $14,100, respectively. The increase in our backlog related to Battery &#38; Energy Products is primarily due to higher demand batteries from OEM&#8217;s for our batteries for medical applications, primary batteries from the U.S. Department of Defense, chargers from an international large defense prime contractor and our new products in other commercial markets. A large majority of the 2015 backlog is related to orders that are expected to ship throughout 2016.

&#160;

Communications Systems 

&#160; 

We target sales of our communications systems, which include power solutions and accessories to support communications systems such as RF amplifiers, power supplies, power cables, connector assemblies, amplified speakers, equipment mounts, case equipment and integrated communication systems, to military OEMs and U.S. and allied foreign militaries. We sell our products directly and through authorized distributors to OEMs and to defense organizations in the U.S. and internationally. We market our products to defense organizations and OEMs in the U.S. and internationally.

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our backlog related to Communications Systems orders was approximately $8,400 and $700, respectively. The increase in our backlog related to Communications Systems orders is driven primarily by the award of an $8,200 order through an OEM for the U.S. Army for our new McDowell Research Corporation (&#8220;MRC&#8221;) product &#8211; Vehicle Installed Power Enhanced Rifleman Appliqu&#233; (&#8220;VIPER&#8221;), as well as integrated systems supporting OEMs. The 2015 backlog is related to orders that are expected to ship throughout 2016.

&#160; 

Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks 

&#160; 

We rely on licenses of technology as well as our patented and unpatented proprietary information, know-how and trade secrets to maintain and develop our competitive position. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information, there can be no assurance that others will neither develop the same or similar information independently nor obtain access to our proprietary information. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would prevail if we asserted our intellectual property rights against third parties, or that third parties will not successfully assert infringement claims against us in the future. We believe, however, that our success depends more on the knowledge, ability, experience and technological expertise of our employees, than on the legal protection that our patents and other proprietary rights may or will afford. 

&#160; 

We hold seven patents issued in the U.S. and two patents issued in Mexico. We believe our patents protect technology that makes automated production more cost-effective and protects important competitive features of our products. However, we do not consider our business to be dependent on patent protection. 

&#160; 

As part of our employment commencement process, our employees are required to enter into agreements providing for confidentiality of certain information and the assignment of rights to inventions made by them while employed by us. These agreements also contain certain noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions effective during the employment term and for varying periods thereafter depending on position and location. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enforce these agreements. All of our employees agree to abide by the terms of a Code of Ethics policy that provides for the confidentiality of certain information received during the course of their employment. Nevertheless, the enforceability of such agreements is subject to public policy limitations that vary from state to state so we cannot be assured that they will be enforceable in accordance with their terms if at all. 

&#160; 

Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell our products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. The following are registered trademarks of ours: Ultralife &#226; , Ultralife Thin Cell &#226; , Ultralife HiRate &#226; , The New Power Generation &#210; , LithiumPower &#210; , SmartCircuit &#210; , We Are Power &#210; , AMTI &#210; , ABLE &#212; , McDowell Research&#174;, and Max Juice For More Gigs&#174;. 

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing and Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We manufacture our products from raw materials and component parts that we purchase. Our manufacturing facilities in Newark, New York are ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001, and ISO 13485 certified. Our manufacturing facilities in Shenzhen, China are ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001and ISO 13485 certified. Our manufacturing facilities in Virginia Beach, Virginia are ISO 9001:2008 certified. 

&#160; 

We expect our future raw material purchases to fluctuate based on our knowledge regarding the timing of customer orders, the related need to build inventory in anticipation of orders and actual shipment dates. 

&#160; 

Battery &#38; Energy Products 

&#160; 

Our Newark, New York and Shenzhen, China facilities have the capacity to produce cylindrical cells, 9-volt batteries, and thin cells. Capacity, however, is also related to individual operations, and product mix changes can produce bottlenecks in an individual operation, constraining overall capacity. We have acquired new machinery and equipment in areas where production bottlenecks have resulted in the past and we believe that we have sufficient capacity in these areas. We continually evaluate our requirements for additional capital equipment, and we believe that the planned increases will be adequate to meet foreseeable customer demand. 

&#160; 

Certain materials used in our products are available only from a single source or a limited number of sources. Additionally, we may elect to develop relationships with a single or limited number of sources for materials that are otherwise generally available. Although we believe that alternative sources are available to supply materials that could replace materials we use and that, if necessary, we would be able to redesign our products to make use of an alternative product, any interruption in our supply from any supplier that serves currently as our sole source could delay product shipments and adversely affect our financial performance and relationships with our customers. Although we have experienced interruptions of product deliveries by sole source suppliers, which have not had a material adverse effect on us, we cannot assure that they would not in the future. All other raw materials utilized by us are readily available from many sources. 

&#160; 

We use various utilities to provide heat, light and power to our facilities. We continue to seek ways to reduce utility costs and will initiate energy-saving projects at times to assist in this effort. It is possible, however, that rising energy costs may have an adverse effect on our financial results. 

&#160; 

We believe that the raw materials and components utilized for our rechargeable batteries are readily available from many sources. Although we believe that alternative sources are available to supply materials and components that could replace materials or components we use, any interruption in our supply from any supplier that serves currently as our sole source could delay product shipments and adversely affect our financial performance and relationships with our customers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We concentrate significant resources on research and development activities to improve our technological capabilities and to design new products for customers&#8217; applications. We conduct our research and development in Newark, New York; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Tallahassee, Florida and Shenzhen, China. During 2015 and 2014, we expended $6,112 and $5,648, respectively, on research and development, including $509 and $315, respectively, on customer sponsored research and development activities, which are included in cost of goods sold. Research and development expense was $5,603 and $5,333 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect that research and development expenditures in the future will be fairly consistent with those in 2015, as we anticipate that new product development initiatives will drive our growth. As in the past, we will continue to make funding decisions for our research and development efforts based upon strategic demand for customer applications. 

&#160;

We continue to internally develop a variety of communications accessories and systems for the global defense market to meet the ever-changing demands of our customers. 

&#160; 

Safety; Regulatory Matters; Environmental Considerations 

&#160; 

Certain of the materials utilized in our batteries may pose safety problems if improperly used, stored, or handled. We have designed our batteries to minimize safety hazards both in manufacturing and use. 

&#160; 

The transportation of non-rechargeable and rechargeable lithium batteries is regulated in the U.S. by the Department of Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;), and internationally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (&#8220;ICAO&#8221;) and corresponding International Air Transport Association (&#8220;IATA&#8221;) Dangerous Goods Regulations and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (&#8220;IMDG&#8221;), and other country specific regulations. These regulations are based on the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. We currently ship our products pursuant to PHMSA, ICAO, IATA, IMDG and other country specific hazardous goods regulations. The regulations require companies to meet certain testing, packaging, labeling, marking and shipping paper specifications for safety reasons. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any significant costs in order to comply with these regulations. We believe we comply with all current U.S. and international regulations for the shipment of our products, and we intend and expect to comply with any new regulations that are imposed. We have established our own testing facilities to ensure that we comply with these regulations. However, if we are unable to comply with any such new regulations, or if regulations are introduced that limit our or our customers&#8217; ability to transport our products in a cost-effective manner, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

13&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The European Union&#8217;s Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (&#8220;the EU RoHS Directive&#8221;) places restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. All applicable products sold in the European Union market must pass RoHS compliance. While this directive does not apply to batteries and does not currently affect our defense products, should any changes occur in the directive that would affect our products, we intend and expect to comply with any new regulations that are imposed. However, we cannot assure that the cost of complying with such new regulations would not have a material adverse effect on us. Our commercial chargers are substantially in compliance with the EU RoHS Directive. 

&#160; 

The European Union&#8217;s Battery Directive &#34;on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators&#34; (the &#8220;EU Battery Directive&#8221;) is intended to cover all types of batteries regardless of their shape, volume, weight, material composition or use. It is aimed at reducing mercury, cadmium, lead and other metals in the environment by minimizing the use of these substances in batteries and by treating and re-using old batteries. The EU Battery Directive applies to all types of batteries except those used to protect European Member States' security, for military purposes, or sent into space. To achieve these objectives, the EU Battery Directive prohibits the marketing of some batteries containing hazardous substances. It establishes schemes aimed at high level of collection and recycling of batteries with quantified collection and recycling targets. The EU Battery Directive sets out minimum rules for producer responsibility and provisions with regard to labeling of batteries and their removability from equipment. The EU Battery Directive requires product markings for batteries and accumulators to provide information on capacity and to facilitate reuse and safe disposal. We currently ship our products pursuant to the requirements of the EU Battery Directive. 

&#160; 

This EU Battery Directive requires that producers or importers of particular classes of electrical goods are financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. This directive assigns levels of responsibility to companies doing business in European Union markets based on their relative market share. This directive calls on each European Union member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive. As additional European Union member states pass enabling legislation our compliance system should be sufficient to meet such requirements. Our current estimated costs associated with our compliance with these directives based on our current market share are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of these directives as European Union member states implement guidance, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates. 

&#160; 

China&#8217;s &#8220;Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation&#8221; (&#8220;China RoHS&#8221;) provides a two-step, broad regulatory framework including hazardous substance restrictions similar to those imposed by the EU RoHS Directive. China RoHS applies to methods for the control and reduction of pollution and other public hazards to the environment caused during the production, sale, and import of electronic information products (&#8220;EIP&#8221;) in China. Currently, only the first step of the regulatory framework of China RoHS, which details marking and labeling requirements under Standard SJT11364-2006 (&#8220;Marking Standard&#8221;), is in effect. However, the methods under China RoHS only apply to EIP placed in the marketplace in China. Additionally, the Marking Standard does not apply to components sold to OEMs for use in other EIPs. Our sales in China are limited to sales to OEMs and to distributors who supply to OEMs. Should our sales strategy change to include direct sales to end-users, we believe our compliance system is sufficient to meet our requirements under China RoHS. Our current estimated costs associated with our compliance with this regulation based on our current market share are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of this regulation, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates.

&#160; 

National, state and local laws impose various environmental controls on the manufacture, transportation, storage, use and disposal of batteries and of certain chemicals used in the manufacture of batteries. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with current environmental regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. There can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture, transportation, storage, use and disposal of materials used to manufacture our batteries or restricting disposal of batteries will not be imposed or that such regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2015 and 2014, we spent approximately $155 and $45, respectively, on environmental compliance, including costs to properly dispose of potentially hazardous waste. 

14&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Since non-rechargeable and rechargeable lithium battery chemistries react adversely with water and water vapor, certain of our manufacturing processes must be performed in a controlled environment with low relative humidity. Our Newark, New York and Shenzhen, China facilities contain dry rooms or glove box equipment, as well as specialized air-drying equipment. 

&#160;

In addition to the environmental regulations previously described, our products are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&#8220;ITAR&#8221;), the Export Administration Regulations (&#8220;EAR&#8221;) and trade sanctions against embargoed countries.

&#160;

The ITAR is a set of United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List. These regulations implement the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act, and are described in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Department of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls interprets and enforces ITAR. Its goal is to safeguard U.S. national security and further U.S. foreign policy objectives.

&#160;

The related EAR are enforced and interpreted by the Bureau of Industry and Security in the Commerce Department. The Department of Defense is also involved in the review and approval process. Inspections in support of import and export laws are performed at border crossings is performed by Customs and Border Protection, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security.

&#160;

Products and services developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to the export and import controls of the nation in which the foreign location operates.

&#160;

We believe we are in material compliance with these domestic and international export regulations. However, failure of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business through possible fines, denial of export privileges, or loss of customers. Further, while we are not aware of any proposed changes to these regulations, any change in the scope or enforcement of export or import regulations or related legislation could have a material adverse affect on our business through increased costs of compliance or reduction in the international growth prospects available to us.

&#160;

Our future estimated costs associated with our compliance with ITAR, EAR, and the foreign export and import controls we are subject to based on our current sales volumes are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of these regulations, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates. 

&#160; 

Battery &#38; Energy Products 

&#160; 

Our non-rechargeable battery products incorporate lithium metal, which reacts with water and may cause fires if not handled properly. In the past, we have experienced fires that have temporarily interrupted certain manufacturing operations. We believe that we have adequate fire suppression systems and insurance, including business interruption insurance, to protect against the occurrence of fires and fire losses in our facilities. 

&#160; 

Our 9-volt battery, among other sizes, is designed to conform to the dimensional and electrical standards of the American National Standards Institute. Several of our products are recognized by authorized certification bodies such as Underwriters Laboratories, Intertek and SGS. 

&#160; 

Communications Systems 

&#160; 

We are not currently aware of any regulatory requirements regarding the disposal of communications products. 

&#160;

&#160;

Corporate 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Section 1502 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) requires public companies to disclose whether tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, commonly known as &#8220;conflict minerals,&#8221; are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by a public company and if those elements originated from armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. To comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by SEC rules, we are required to perform due diligence inquiries of our suppliers to determine whether or not our products contain such minerals and from which countries and source (smelter) the minerals were obtained. Our annual report on Form SD was filed by the statutory due date of June 1, 2015 for the 2014 calendar year and we continue to implement appropriate measures with our suppliers in order to better ascertain the origin of the conflict minerals in our products.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Competition in both the battery and communications systems markets is, and is expected to remain, intense. The competition ranges from development stage companies to major domestic and international companies, many of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. We compete against companies producing batteries as well as companies producing communications systems. We compete on the basis of design flexibility, performance, price, reliability and customer support. There can be no assurance that our technologies and products will not be rendered obsolete by developments in competing technologies or services that are currently under development or that may be developed in the future or that our competitors will not market competing products and services that obtain market acceptance more rapidly than ours. 

&#160; 

Historically, although other entities may attempt to take advantage of the growth of the battery market, the lithium battery cell industry has certain technological and economic barriers to entry. The development of technology, equipment and manufacturing techniques and the operation of a facility for the automated production of lithium battery cells require large capital expenditures, which may deter new entrants from commencing production. Through our experience in battery cell manufacturing, we have also developed significant expertise in the non-rechargeable battery market, which we believe would be difficult to reproduce without substantial time and expense. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed a total of 691 permanent and temporary employees: 35 in research and development, 586 in production and 70 in sales and administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
