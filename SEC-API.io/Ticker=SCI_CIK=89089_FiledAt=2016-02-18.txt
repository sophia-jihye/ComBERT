Business. 

General 

We are North America&#8217;s largest provider of deathcare products and services, with a network of funeral service locations and cemeteries unequaled in geographic scale and reach. At December 31, 2015 , we operated 1,535 &#32;funeral service locations and 469 &#32;cemeteries (including 262 &#32;funeral service/cemetery combination locations), which are geographically diversified across 45 states, eight &#32;Canadian provinces, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. We are best known for our Dignity Memorial&#174; brand, North America's first transcontinental brand of deathcare products and services. Our other brands are Dignity Planning&#8482;, National Cremation Society&#174;, Advantage&#174; Funeral and Cremation Services, Funeraria del Angel&#8482;, Making Everlasting Memories&#174;, Neptune Society&#8482; and Trident Society&#8482;. 

&#32;Our funeral service and cemetery operations consist of funeral service locations, cemeteries, funeral service/cemetery combination locations, crematoria, and related businesses, which enables us to serve a wide array of customer needs. We sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at the time of need and on a preneed basis. 

History 

We were incorporated in Texas in July of 1962 . Our original business plan was based on efficiencies of scale, specifically reducing overhead costs by sharing resources such as preparation services, accounting, transportation, and personnel among funeral service locations in a business &#8220;cluster.&#8221; After proving the plan&#8217;s effectiveness in Houston in the early 1960s , we set out to apply this operating strategy through the acquisition of deathcare businesses in other markets over the next three decades. Beginning in 1993 , we expanded beyond North America, acquiring major deathcare companies in Australia, the United Kingdom, and France, plus smaller holdings in other European countries and South America. By the end of 1999 , our global network numbered more than 4,500 funeral service locations, cemeteries, and crematories in more than 20 countries. 

During the mid to late 1990s , acquisitions of deathcare facilities became extremely competitive, resulting in increased prices for acquisitions and substantially reduced returns on invested capital. In 1999 , we significantly reduced our level of acquisition activity and over the next several years implemented various initiatives to pay down debt, increase cash flow, reduce overhead costs, and increase efficiency. We divested our international businesses and many North American funeral service locations and cemeteries that were either underperforming or did not fit our long-term strategy. At the same time, we began to capitalize on the strength of our network by introducing to North America the first transcontinental brand of deathcare services and products &#8212; Dignity Memorial &#174; &#32;(See www.dignitymemorial.com ). Information contained on our website is not part of this report. 

In late 2006 , having arrived at a position of significant financial strength and improved operating efficiency, we acquired the then second largest company in the North American deathcare industry, Alderwoods Group. In early 2010 , we acquired the then fifth largest company in the North American deathcare industry, Keystone North America. In &#32;June of 2011 , we acquired 70% of the outstanding shares of The Neptune Society, Inc. (Neptune), which is the nation's largest direct cremation organization. Subsequently, in 2013 and 2014, we acquired the remaining 30% of the outstanding shares of Neptune. In &#32;December 2013 , we purchased Stewart Enterprises, Inc. (Stewart), the then second largest operator of funeral service locations and cemeteries in North America. 

Funeral and Cemetery Operations 

Our funeral service and cemetery operations consist of funeral service locations, cemeteries, funeral/cemetery combination locations, crematoria, and related businesses. See Note 15 in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for financial information about our business segments and geographic areas. 

Funeral service/cemetery combination locations are those businesses in which a funeral service location is physically located within or adjoining a cemetery that we own. Combination locations allow certain facility, personnel, and equipment costs to be shared between the funeral service location and cemetery. Such combination facilities typically can be more cost competitive and have higher gross margins than if the funeral and cemetery operations were operated separately. Combination locations also create synergies between funeral and cemetery preneed sales force personnel and give families added convenience to purchase both funeral and cemetery merchandise and services at a single location. We have the largest number of combination locations in North America. Fifty-six percent of our cemeteries are part of a combination location. Our combination operations include Rose Hills, the largest combination operation in the United States, performing over 4,800 funeral services and 7,900 cemetery interments per year. 

Funeral service locations provide all professional services related to funerals and cremations, including the use of funeral home facilities and motor vehicles, arranging and directing services, removal, preparation, embalming, cremations, memorialization, and catering. Funeral merchandise, including burial caskets and related accessories, urns and other cremation 

receptacles, outer burial containers, flowers, on-line and video tributes, stationery products, casket and cremation memorialization products, and other ancillary merchandise, is sold at funeral service locations. 

Our cemeteries provide cemetery property interment rights, including developed lots, lawn crypts, mausoleum spaces, niches, and other cremation memorialization and interment options. Cemetery merchandise and services, including memorial markers and bases, outer burial containers, flowers and floral placement, other ancillary merchandise, graveside services, merchandise installation, and burial openings and closings, are sold at our cemeteries. 

We also sell preneed cemetery property interment rights and funeral and cemetery merchandise and services whereby a customer contractually agrees to the terms of certain products and services to be delivered and performed in the future. We define these sales as preneed sales. As a result of such preneed sales, our backlog of unfulfilled preneed funeral and cemetery contracts was $9.5 &#32;billion and $9.3 &#32;billion at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

In 2015 &#32;our operations in the United States and Canada were organized into 31 major markets, 38 metro markets, and 53 main street markets. Each market is led by a market manager or director with responsibility for funeral and/or cemetery operations and preneed sales. Within each market, the funeral service locations and cemeteries share common resources such as personnel, preparation services, and vehicles. 

The following table at December 31, 2015 provides the number of our funeral service locations and cemeteries by country, and by state, territory, or province:

Includes businesses held for sale at December 31, 2015 . 

We believe we have satisfactory title to the properties owned and used in our business, subject to various liens, encumbrances, and easements that are incidental to ownership rights and uses and do not materially detract from the value of the property. We also lease a number of facilities that we use in our business under both capital and operating leases. 

At December 31, 2015 , we owned approximately 85% of the real estate and buildings used at our facilities, and the remainder of the facilities were leased. At December 31, 2015 , our 469 &#32;cemeteries contained a total of approximately 34,599 acres, of which approximately 65% was developed. 

A map of our locations in North America is presented below: 

Competition 

Although there are several public companies that own funeral service locations and cemeteries, the majority of deathcare businesses in North America are locally-owned, independent operations. We estimate that our funeral and cemetery market share in North America is approximately 16% &#32;based on estimated total industry revenues. The position of a single funeral service location or cemetery in any community is a function of the name, reputation, and location of that funeral service location or cemetery, although competitive pricing, professional service and attention, and well-maintained locations are also important. 

We believe we have an unparalleled network of funeral service locations and cemeteries that offer high-quality products and services at prices that are competitive with local competing funeral service locations, cemeteries, and retail locations. Within this network, the funeral service locations and cemeteries operate under various names as most operations were acquired as existing businesses. We have co-branded our funeral operations under the name Dignity Memorial &#174; . We believe our transcontinental branding strategy gives us a strategic advantage and identity in the industry. While this branding process is intended to emphasize our seamless national network of funeral service locations and cemeteries, the original names associated with acquired operations, and their inherent goodwill and heritage, generally remain the same. For example, Geo. H. Lewis &#38; Sons Funeral Directors is now Geo. H. Lewis &#38; Sons Funeral Directors, a Dignity Memorial &#174; &#32;provider. 

Strategies for Growth 

We believe we are well-positioned for long-term profitable growth. We are the largest company in the North American deathcare industry with unparalleled scale on both a national and local basis and are poised to benefit from the aging of America. The demographic landscape is driving our company strategy. According to the United States Census Bureau, the current number of Americans that are 60 and older is approximately 67 million. This number is expected to grow to more than 77 million by 2020, resulting in a growing number of people that will likely be interested in preneed options. 

We have three core strategies designed to grow the company and enhance shareholder value: 1) grow revenue, 2) leverage our unparalleled scale, and 3) deploy capital. 

Grow Revenue 

We have a three-pronged approach to grow revenue that is focused on the customer and consists of: 1) remaining relevant to the customer, 2) growing our preneed sales, and 3) managing our footprint. 

Remaining Relevant to the Customer. &#32; Remaining relevant to our customer is key to generating revenue growth in a changing customer environment. We work to meet the varying needs of our customers to give them what they want. In our funeral segment, we focus on memorialization services that will be meaningful to the customer and their family members and friends. We continue to offer contemporary product and service offerings. We also focus on the ethnic traditions and customs important to our customers. Additionally, we emphasize the simplicity and convenience of our packaged offerings. 

In our cemetery segment, we have created tiers within our cemetery product offerings to provide more choices for our customers. As with our funeral home segment, we also cater to the ethnic traditions and customs important to our customers. We continue to develop innovative products such as recurring floral placements and customized cemetery property offerings. We have also simplified the decision-making process. 

Growing Our Preneed Sales. &#32; Our preneed sales program drives revenue growth now and into the future. Within our funeral segment, our preneed sales create brand awareness, grow future market share, and diversify our revenue stream in a low-inflation environment. Due to our scale, our preneed sales program is not capital intensive and gives us a competitive advantage. Within our cemetery segment, we have a focus on increasing sales force productivity combined with tiered cemetery property offerings and pricing to drive current revenue growth. 

Managing Our Footprint. &#32; We will continue to manage our footprint with a customer-driven focus. Within our funeral segment, we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and to build new funeral homes in areas that provide us with the potential for scale and areas with the highest return customer categories and market traits. Within our cemetery segment, we plan to pursue strategic acquisitions to create more opportunities to sell to Baby Boomers through our customer-driven strategy. We believe our unparalleled business footprint and geographic diversity uniquely positions us to benefit from the aging Baby Boomer population. 

Leverage Our Unparalleled Scale 

We also leverage our unparalleled scale using a three-pronged approach, which consists of: 1) developing our sales organization, 2) optimizing our network, and 3) using our scale with our preneed trust and insurance backlog. Our size and broad geographic network of businesses gives us a significant advantage in the industry. 

Developing Our Sales Organization. &#32; Over the past several years, we have invested in the infrastructure and training of our sales organization. During 2016, we will continue our focus on enhancing the productivity and effectiveness of the sales team and growing the number sales counselors. We believe that our scale allows us to expand our sales organization in a manner that our competitors cannot afford to replicate. 

Optimizing Our Network. &#32; We continue to drive operating discipline and leverage our scale through standardizing processes and capitalizing on new technologies. We regularly examine our purchasing spend to look for opportunities to consolidate our supplier base, modify processes and policies for more efficient purchasing, and employ metrics to manage and improve supplier performance. Additionally, many of our accounting and administrative functions are outsourced to third-party providers, allowing for greater efficiency. 

Using Our Scale with Our Preneed Trust and Insurance Backlog. &#32;Due to our $9.5 &#32;billion backlog, we benefit from having access to premier financial partners in the industry. For our trust investments, we have access to preeminent money managers and lower fee structures, which we believe is a low risk structure that will provide us with higher returns and lower costs of administration over time. We also enjoy favorable terms with our insurance provider. 

Deploy Capital 

Our third core strategy is to maximize capital deployment opportunities. Our priority for capital deployment: is 1) investing in acquisitions and building new funeral service locations, 2) paying dividends, 3) repurchasing shares, and 4) repurchasing debt. 

Investing in Acquisitions and Building New Funeral Homes. &#32; As noted above, we plan to use our capital to manage our footprint by focusing on strategic acquisitions and building new funeral homes where the expected returns are attractive and exceed our weighted average cost of capital plus a risk premium. We target businesses with favorable customer segments and/or where we can achieve additional economies of scale. 

Paying Dividends. &#32; Our quarterly dividend rate has steadily grown from $0.025 per common share in 2005 to $0.12 &#32;per common share in 2015. We target a payout ratio of 30% to 40% of recurring net income. We intend to continue to grow our 

cash dividend commensurate with the growth of our free cash flow. While we intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, all future dividends are subject to limitations in our debt covenants and final determination by our Board of Directors each quarter upon review of our financial performance. 

Repurchasing Shares. &#32; Absent opportunities for strategic acquisitions, we expect to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, debt covenants, and normal trading restrictions. 

Repurchasing Debt. &#32; We will seek to make open market debt repurchases when it is opportunistic to do so relative to other capital deployment opportunities in order to manage our near-term debt maturity profile. 

Associates 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed 15,654 &#32;individuals on a full-time basis and 8,131 &#32;individuals on a part-time basis. Of the full-time associates, 14,716 &#32;were employed in the funeral and cemetery operations and 938 &#32;were employed in corporate or other overhead activities and services. All eligible associates in the United States who so elect are covered by our group health and life insurance plans. Associates covered by a collective bargaining agreement are typically covered by union health plans and are not eligible to participate in our health insurance plan. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , there were 9,447 &#32;and 9,022 &#32;associates, respectively, who had elected to participate in our group health insurance plans. Eligible associates in the United States are covered by retirement plans of SCI or various subsidiaries, while international associates are covered by other SCI (or SCI subsidiary) defined or government-mandated benefit plans. Approximately 2.5% &#32;of our associates are represented by unions. Although labor disputes occur from time to time, relations with associates are generally considered favorable. 

Regulation 

Our funeral operations are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;) under the FTC&#8217;s Trade Regulation Rule on Funeral Industry Practices (the &#8220;Funeral Rule&#8221;), which went into effect in 1984. The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral merchandise and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: 1) misrepresenting legal, crematory, and cemetery requirements; 2) embalming for a fee without permission; 3) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; and 4) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral merchandise or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral merchandise or services. 

Our operations are also subject to regulation, supervision, and licensing under numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as Canadian and provincial laws and regulations. For example, state laws impose licensing requirements for funeral service locations and funeral directors and regulate preneed sales including our preneed trust activities. Our facilities are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations. We take various measures in order to comply with the Funeral Rule and laws and regulations. For example, we have established and maintain policies, procedures, and practices; we engage in training of our personnel; and we carry out ongoing reviews of our compliance efforts. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Funeral Rule and all laws and regulations. 

Federal, state, and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies (including Canadian legislative bodies and agencies) frequently propose new laws and regulations, some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the deathcare industry in general. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us.
