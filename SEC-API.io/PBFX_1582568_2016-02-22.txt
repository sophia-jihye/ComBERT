Overview 

PBFX is a fee-based, growth-oriented, Delaware master limited partnership formed in February 2013 by subsidiaries of PBF Energy Inc. and its indirect subsidiary, PBF Logistics GP LLC (&#8220;PBF GP&#8221;), our general partner, to own or lease, operate, develop and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBF GP is our general partner and is wholly-owned by PBF Energy Company LLC (&#8220;PBF LLC&#8221;). PBF Energy Inc. is the sole managing member of PBF LLC and as of December 31, 2015 owned 95.1% &#32;of the total economic interest in PBF LLC. We refer you to &#8220;Organizational Structure&#8221; below for an illustration of our relationship with PBF Energy Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this report to &#8220;PBF Energy&#8221; refer collectively to PBF Energy Inc. and its subsidiaries, other than PBFX, its subsidiaries and our general partner. On May 14, 2014, PBFX completed its initial public offering of 15,812,500 common units (including 2,062,500 common units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option) (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;). PBFX filed a registration statement on Form S-1, with respect to the Offering, with the SEC which was declared effective on May 8, 2014. On May 9, 2014, PBFX&#8217;s common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;PBFX&#8221;. As of December 31, 2015, PBF LLC held a 53.7% &#32;limited partner interest in PBFX, a non-economic general partner interest and owns all of PBFX&#8217;s incentive distribution rights (&#8220;IDRs&#8221;), with the remaining 46.3% &#32;limited partner interest held by public unitholders. 

The Partnership includes the assets, liabilities and results of operations of certain crude oil and refined product terminaling, pipeline and storage assets, previously operated and owned by subsidiaries of PBF Holding Company LLC (&#8220;PBF Holding&#8221;), Delaware City Refining Company LLC (&#8220;DCR&#8221;), Toledo Refining Company LLC (&#8220;TRC&#8221;) and PBF Holding&#8217;s previously held subsidiary, Delaware Pipeline Company LLC (&#8220;DPC&#8221;), which were acquired in a series of transactions during 2014 and 2015. 

In connection with the Offering, pursuant to a contribution agreement and conveyance agreement (the &#8220;Contribution Agreement I&#8221;), PBF LLC contributed a light crude oil rail unloading terminal at the Delaware City refinery that can also service the Paulsboro refinery (which we refer to as the &#8220;DCR Rail Terminal&#8221;) and a crude oil truck unloading terminal at the Toledo refinery (which we refer to as the &#8220;Toledo Truck Terminal&#8221;). Prior to completion of the Offering, the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the aforementioned assets related to PBF MLP Predecessor (our &#8220;Predecessor&#8221;), our predecessor for accounting purposes. 

On September 16, 2014, the Partnership entered into a contribution agreement (the &#8220;Contribution Agreement II&#8221;) with PBF LLC to acquire the Delaware City West Unloading Rack (the &#8220;DCR West Rack&#8221;), a heavy crude oil unloading facility at the Delaware City refinery with total throughput capacity of at least 40,000 barrels per day (&#8220;bpd&#8221;). The transaction closed on September 30, 2014. Also, on December 2, 2014, the Partnership entered into a contribution agreement with PBF LLC (the &#8220;Contribution Agreement III&#8221;) to acquire a tank farm and related facilities located at PBF Energy&#8217;s Toledo refinery, including a propane storage and loading facility (collectively, the &#8220;Toledo Storage Facility&#8221;). The transaction closed on December 11, 2014. In addition, on May 14, 2015, the Partnership entered into an additional contribution agreement with PBF LLC (the &#8220;Contribution Agreement IV&#8221; and together with the Contribution Agreement I, the Contribution Agreement II and the Contribution Agreement III, the &#8220;Contribution Agreements&#8221;) to acquire the Delaware City Products Pipeline, a 23.4 mile, 16-inch interstate petroleum products pipeline with capacity in excess of 125,000 bpd and the Delaware City Truck Rack, a 15-lane, 76,000 bpd capacity truck loading rack located at PBF Energy&#8217;s Delaware City, Delaware refinery. The Delaware City Products Pipeline and Delaware City Truck Rack are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack.&#8221; The transactions entered into after the Offering are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Acquisitions from PBF.&#8221; 

The financial statements presented in this Form 10-K include the consolidated financial results of our Predecessor, for periods presented through May 13, 2014, and the consolidated financial results of PBFX for the period beginning May 14, 2014, the date of the Offering. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 presents solely the consolidated financial position of PBFX and the balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 presents the consolidated financial position of PBFX and the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack. We recorded the Acquisitions from PBF at PBF Energy&#8217;s historical book value, as the Acquisitions from PBF were treated as a reorganization of entities under common control. We have retrospectively adjusted the financial information of our Predecessor and PBFX contained herein to include the historical results of the DCR West Rack, Toledo Storage Facility and the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack prior to the effective date of each transaction. 

Our Predecessor did not historically operate its assets for the purpose of generating revenues independent of other PBF Energy businesses that we support, with the exception of the Delaware City Products Pipeline. In connection with the closing of the Offering and each of the Acquisitions from PBF, we entered into commercial and service agreements with subsidiaries of PBF Energy under which we operate our assets for the purpose of generating fee-based revenues. We receive, handle and transfer crude oil and refined products from sources located throughout the United States and Canada and store crude oil, refined products and intermediates for PBF Energy in support of its refineries located in Toledo, Ohio, Delaware City, Delaware and Paulsboro, New Jersey. Our assets consist of the DCR Rail Terminal, the Toledo Truck Terminal, the DCR West Rack, the Toledo Storage Facility and the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack (collectively referred to as the &#8220;Contributed Assets&#8221;), which are integral components of the crude oil and refined products delivery and storage operations at PBF Energy&#8217;s refineries. 

Since we do not own any of the crude oil or refined products that we handle nor engage in the trading of crude oil or refined products, we have minimal direct exposure to risks associated with commodity price fluctuations. However, these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term through their effects on our customer&#8217;s operations. In 2015 and 2014, 100% of our revenue was derived from PBF Energy under various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that generally include minimum volume commitments. 

The Partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes or the income taxes of those states that follow the federal income tax treatment of partnerships. Instead, for purposes of these income taxes, each partner of the Partnership is required to take into account his, her or its share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction in computing his, her or its federal and state income tax liabilities, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to such partner by the Partnership. The taxable income reportable to each partner takes into account differences between the tax basis and fair market value of PBFX&#8217;s assets, the acquisition price of such partner&#8217;s units and the taxable income allocation requirements under the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (our &#8220;partnership agreement&#8221;). 

Recent Developments 

Plains Asset Purchase 

On February 2, 2016, we announced that our whol ly-owned subsidiary, PBF Logistics Products Terminals LLC, entered into an agreement to purchase the assets of four refined product terminals located in the greater Philadelphia region (the &#8220;East Coast Terminals&#8221;) from an affiliate of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. for total cash consideration of $100.0 million (the "Plains Asset Purchase"). This acquisition will expand our storage and terminaling footprint and introduce third-party customers to our revenue base. The acquisition is expected to be financed through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings from our senior secured revolving credit facility and issuance of equity, which may include common units sold to our indirect parent, PBF Energy. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016, subject to customary closing conditions. 

Organizational Structure 

The following simplified diagram depicts our organizational and ownership structure as of December 31, 2015: 

Assets and Operations 

We prepare segment information on the same basis that we review financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Currently, our business consists of two operating segments: (i) our transportation and terminaling segment and (ii) our storage segment. Additional segment and financial information is contained in our segment results included in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and Note 12&#8212;Segment Information, of our consolidated financial statements included in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Transportation and Terminaling Segment 

&#8226; 

Our DCR Rail Terminal is a light crude oil rail unloading terminal which commenced operations in February 2013 and serves PBF Energy&#8217;s Delaware City and Paulsboro refineries (&#8220;East Coast refineries&#8221;). The DCR Rail Terminal has a double-loop track with an unloading capacity of 130,000 bpd, which can hold up to two 100-car unit trains and is capable of unloading a single unit train in approximately 14 hours. PBF Energy can move crude oil by barge to its Paulsboro refinery from its Delaware City refinery after the crude has been unloaded. PBF Energy can also move the crude oil to other locations, including locations owned by third parties. The DCR Rail Terminal allows the East Coast refineries to source crude oil from Western Canada and the United States, which may provide cost advantages at certain times compared to international crude oil that has historically been processed at the East Coast refineries and that is priced off of the Brent benchmark. The facility is connected to the Delaware City refinery&#8217;s crude tank farm by DCR&#8217;s pipeline. PBF Energy&#8217;s East Coast refineries have a combined refining capacity of 370,000 bpd. 

&#8226; 

Our Toledo Truck Terminal serves PBF Energy&#8217;s Toledo refinery, is currently comprised of six lease automatic custody transfer (&#8220;LACT&#8221;) units, and has unloading capacity of 22,500 bpd. PBF Energy acquired the Toledo refinery in 2011 and added additional truck crude oil unloading capabilities to provide feedstock sourcing flexibility for the refinery and enable the Toledo refinery to run a more cost-advantaged crude oil slate. The Toledo refinery processes light, sweet crude oil and has a total throughput capacity of 170,000 bpd. 

&#8226; 

Our DCR West Rack is a heavy crude oil unloading facility which commenced operations in August 2014 and serves PBF Energy&#8217;s Delaware City refinery with total throughput capacity of at least 40,000 bpd. The DCR West Rack consists of 25 heated unloading stations, is capable of handling 50 cars simultaneously located between two tracks and is equipped with steam and nitrogen to facilitate the unloading of heavy crude oil sourced from Canada. The facility can also unload light crude oil. Additionally, there are six other ladder tracks available, which provide the DCR West Rack with enough capacity to hold two 100 car unit trains. The facility is connected to the Delaware City refinery&#8217;s crude tank farm by DCR&#8217;s pipeline. 

&#8226; 

The terminaling facility at our Toledo Storage Facility at PBF Energy&#8217;s Toledo refinery consists of 27 propane storage bullets, a truck loading facility and has a throughput capacity of approximately 11,000 bpd. 

&#8226; 

Our Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack serve PBF Energy&#8217;s Delaware City refinery and were acquired in May 2015. The Delaware City Products Pipeline consists of a 23.4 mile, 16-inch interstate petroleum products pipeline with a capacity in excess of 125,000 bpd. The Delaware City Truck Rack consists of a 15-lane, 76,000 bpd capacity truck loading rack utilized to distribute gasoline, distillates and liquefied petroleum gases ("LPGs"). 

Storage Segment 

&#8226; 

The storage facility at our Toledo Storage Facility consists of 30 tanks for storing crude oil, refined products and intermediates. The aggregate shell capacity of the storage facility is approximately 3.9 million barrels, 

of which approximately 1.3 million barrels are dedicated to crude oil storage and approximately 2.6 million barrels are allocated to refined products and intermediates. 

Please see &#8220;Agreements with PBF Energy&#8212;Commercial Agreements&#8221; below for a discussion of our agreements with PBF Energy relating to our terminaling and storage operations.

The Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack Acquisition closed on May 14, 2015. The Partnership borrowed an additional $0.7 million under the Revolving Credit Facility to repay $0.7 million of its $300.0 million term loan facility (&#8220;Term Loan&#8221;) in order to release the $0.7 million in marketable securities that had collateralized the Term Loan. 

Commercial Agreements 

We currently derive all of our revenue from long-term, fee-based agreements with PBF Holding, a subsidiary of PBF Energy (for terminaling and storage services), supported by contractual fee escalations for inflation adjustments and certain increases in our operating costs. We believe the terms and conditions under these agreements, as well as our omnibus and services agreements with PBF Holding described below, are generally no less favorable to either party than those that could have been negotiated with unaffiliated parties with respect to similar services. In addition, certain subsidiaries of PBF Energy have pre-existing commercial relationships with the East Coast Terminals which are intended to be assigned to us in connection with the closing of the pending Plains Asset Purchase.

PBF Holding&#8217;s agreement to reimburse the Partnership for certain expenditures up to $20.0 million per event (net of any insurance recoveries) related to the Contributed Assets for a period of five years after the closing of the Offering, and our agreement to bear the costs associated with the prior expansion of the DCR Rail Terminal crude unloading capability. 

On September 30, 2014, the Original Omnibus Agreement was amended and restated in connection with the DCR West Rack Acquisition (the &#8220;A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement&#8221;). The annual administrative fee to be paid by the Partnership to PBF Energy increased from $2.3 million to approximately $2.5 million. On December 12, 2014, the A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement was amended and restated in connection with the Toledo Storage Facility Acquisition (the &#8220;Second A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement&#8221;). The Second A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement clarified the reimbursements to be made by the Partnership to PBF LLC and from PBF LLC to the Partnership and increased the annual administrative fee to be paid by the Partnership to PBF Energy from approximately $2.5 million to $2.7 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Original Omnibus Agreement, as amended by the A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement and the Second A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement the annual administrative fee of $2.7 million per year was reduced to $2.2 million per year effective as of January 1, 2015. On May 15, 2015, the Second A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement was amended and restated in connection with the Delaware City Products Pipeline and Truck Rack Acquisition (the &#8220;Third A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement&#8221;) resulting in an increase in the annual administrative fee from $2.2 million to $2.35 million. 

Services Agreement 

In connection with the closing of the Offering, we entered into an operation and management services and secondment agreement (the &#8220;Services Agreement&#8221;) with PBF Holding and certain of its subsidiaries, pursuant to which PBF Holding and its subsidiaries provide us with the personnel necessary for the Partnership to perform its obligations under its commercial agreements. We reimburse PBF Holding for the use of such employees and the provision of certain infrastructure-related services to the extent applicable to our operations, including storm water discharge and waste water treatment, steam, potable water, access to certain roads and grounds, sanitary sewer access, electrical power, emergency response, filter press, fuel gas, API solids treatment, fire water and compressed air. In addition, we pay an annual fee of approximately $0.5 million to PBF Holding for the provision of such services pursuant to the Services Agreement. 

On September 30, 2014, the Services Agreement was amended and restated in connection with the DCR West Rack Acquisition (the &#8220;A&#38;R Services Agreement&#8221;) and the annual fee increased from approximately $0.5 million to $0.8 million. On December 12, 2014, PBF Holding, DCR, Delaware City Terminaling, Toledo Terminaling, TRC, the Partnership and PBF GP entered into the Second Amended and Restated Operation and Management Services and Secondment Agreement (the &#8220;Second A&#38;R Services Agreement&#8221;) to incorporate the Toledo Storage Facility into its provisions and increase the annual fee to be paid by the Partnership from $0.8 million to $4.4 million. On May 15, 2015, the Second A&#38;R Services Agreement was amended and restated in connection with the Delaware City Pipeline and Truck Rack Acquisition (the &#8220;Third A&#38;R Services Agreement&#8221;) resulting in an increase in the annual fee payable from $4.4 million to $4.5 million. All fees to be paid pursuant to the Third A&#38;R Services Agreement are indexed for inflation. The Third A&#38;R Services Agreement will terminate upon the termination of the Third A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement, provided that the Partnership may terminate any service on 30 days&#8217; notice. 

Properties 

&#32;Our principal properties are described above in &#8220;Assets and Operations&#8221; under the captions &#8220;Transportation and Terminaling Segment&#8221; and &#8220;Storage Segment.&#8221; We believe that our properties and facilities are adequate for our operations and that our facilities are adequately maintained. Our office is located in the same office as PBF Energy. PBF Energy leases approximately 53,000 square feet for its principal corporate offices in Parsippany, New Jersey. The lease for PBF Energy&#8217;s principal corporate offices expires in 2017. Functions performed in the Parsippany office include overall corporate management, refinery and HSE management, planning and strategy, corporate finance, commercial operations, logistics, contract administration, marketing, investor relations, governmental affairs, accounting, tax, treasury, information technology, legal and human resources support functions. 

Under the Contribution Agreements, PBF Energy, through certain of its subsidiaries, indemnifies us for certain environmental liabilities associated with the ownership and operation of the Contributed Assets and arising at or before the closing of the Offering and the Acquisitions from PBF. See &#8220;&#8212;Environmental Regulations&#8212;Environmental Liabilities&#8221; below for a more detailed discussion of PBF Energy&#8217;s indemnification obligations. 

Competition 

As a result of our contractual relationship with PBF Energy under our commercial agreements and our direct connection to two of its refineries, we believe that our crude oil, refined product and intermediate unloading terminals and storage facility will not face significant competition from other crude oil, refined product and intermediate unloading terminals and storage facilities for PBF Energy&#8217;s crude oil, refined product and intermediate transportation and storage requirements to those refineries we support with respect to the services provided under our commercial agreements. 

If PBF Energy reduces its purchases of crude oil shipped via rail or truck, PBF Energy may only receive the minimum volumes through our crude oil unloading terminals (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not receive the minimum volumes), which would cause a decrease in our revenues. PBF Energy may elect to ship crude oil to its refineries via pipeline or through its refinery marine facilities as an alternative mode of crude oil transportation. PBF Energy competes with integrated petroleum companies, which have their own crude oil storage, supplies and distribution and marketing systems, as well as with independent refiners, many of which also have their own storage, distribution and marketing systems. PBF Energy also competes with other suppliers that purchase refined petroleum products for resale. Competition in any particular geographic area is affected significantly by the volume of products produced by refineries in that area and by the availability of products and the cost of transportation to that area from distant refineries. 

Safety and Maintenance 

We perform preventive and normal maintenance on all of our facilities and make repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate. We also conduct routine and required inspections of those assets as required by regulation. 

Our terminal and storage facilities have response plans, spill prevention and control plans, and other programs designed to respond to emergencies. Our Toledo Truck Terminal is protected with fire systems that are actuated either by sensors or an emergency switch. We continually strive to maintain compliance with applicable air, solid waste, and wastewater regulations. 

Employee Safety 

We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state, and local government authorities and citizens. 

We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements, and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances. 

Insurance 

Terminals and storage facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance and/or are insured under the property, liability and business interruption policies of PBF Energy and/or certain of its subsidiaries, subject to the deductibles and limits applicable to us, which we believe are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances to cover our operations and assets. However, such insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our assets, and we cannot ensure that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage, or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. As we continue to grow, we will continue to monitor limits and retentions under our policies and those of PBF Energy and/or its subsidiaries as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance program. 

Terminal and Pipeline Control Operations 

Our Toledo Truck Terminal, Delaware City Truck Terminal and the propane loading facility at our Toledo Storage Facility are generally automated, but continuously supervised by PBF Energy employees. Our Delaware City Products Pipeline is operated by a third-party with oversight by PBF Energy employees. At the terminals, PBF Energy&#8217;s customers&#8217; truck drivers are provided with security badges to access and use these facilities. In addition, individual trucks are required to be registered in PBF Energy&#8217;s system to ensure that required regulatory inspections are maintained by either PBF Energy&#8217;s customers or their common carriers. 

Environmental Regulation 

Endangered Species Act 

The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats. While some of our facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitats for endangered species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the Endangered Species Act. However, the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected area. 

Environmental Liabilities 

As is the case with all companies engaged in industries similar to ours, we face potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters. These matters include soil and water contamination, air pollution, personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we handled, used, released or disposed of. 

Under the Contribution Agreements, PBF Energy will indemnify us for all known and unknown environmental losses we incur arising from the ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets that occurred or existed on or before the closing of the Offering, or the respective effective dates of the Acquisitions from PBF, subject to certain limitations. In addition, we will indemnify PBF Energy for any environmental losses it incurs relating to ownership or operation of the Contributed Assets that occur after the closing of the Offering or respective acquisition effective dates to the extent PBF Energy is not required to indemnify us for such liabilities. We will not be indemnified for any future spills or releases of hydrocarbons or hazardous materials at our facilities, or, in addition to any other environmental liabilities, otherwise resulting from our operations, unless caused by PBF Holding&#8217;s actions. As a result, we may incur such expenses in the future, which may be substantial. 

Seasonality 

The crude oil and refined products throughput at our facilities are affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenues will be substantially mitigated due to our commercial agreements with PBF Energy that include minimum volume commitments that are constant each calendar quarter. Demand for gasoline is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction work. Decreased demand during the winter months can lower gasoline prices. As a result, our operating results for the first and fourth calendar quarters may be lower than those for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. 

Employees 

We do not have any employees. We are managed by the directors and officers of our general partner. All of our executive management personnel are currently employees of PBF Energy or subsidiaries of PBF Energy and devote a portion of their time to our business and affairs that is required to manage and conduct our operations. The other personnel that conduct our operations are employees of PBF Holding or its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Third A&#38;R Omnibus Agreement, we pay an annual fee to PBF Energy of $2.35 million for the provision of various centralized administrative services and reimburse PBF Energy for direct or allocated costs and expenses incurred by PBF Energy on our behalf. Pursuant to the Third A&#38;R Services Agreement, we use employees of PBF Energy to operate our assets and PBF Energy is reimbursed for such employees through an annual fee of $4.5 million, which also includes provisions of certain utilities and other infrastructure-related services. Please read &#8220;Agreements with PBF Energy.&#8221; 

In addition, PBF Energy and its affiliates have entered into a rail operations services agreement with Savage Services Corporation (&#8220;Savage&#8221;), an unaffiliated third-party, to provide crude oil unloading and other operations services for the Delaware City refinery. Under the rail operations services agreement, Savage is responsible for providing the personnel necessary for the performance of our operations services. Savage is at all times considered an independent contractor and none of Savage&#8217;s employees or contractors are considered an employee, representative or agent of DCR or of us. The costs of Savage&#8217;s services provided to us are passed through to us by PBF Holding and its subsidiaries. From time to time, certain other third parties may provide operating services to us in a capacity as independent contractors.
