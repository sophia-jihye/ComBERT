Description of Business 

&#160;

We are a development-stage company focusing on the acquisition, research, development and, if warranted, commercialization of autologous (using a patient's own cells) cellular therapies that can be used for medical and aesthetic applications. On July 12, 2013, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, RenovaCare Sciences Corp., completed the acquisition of our flagship technology, a treatment methodology for cell isolation for the regeneration of human skin cells, along with a medical-grade liquid spraying device and associated equipment (the " SkinGun TM "), which has been shown in early human clinical use in the United States to naturally regenerate and heal skin for burn victims, along with the associated United States and foreign patents and patent applications. The development of our SkinGun TM is in the early stage and we anticipate that we will be required to expend significant time and resources to further develop our technology and determine whether a commercially viable product can be developed. Research and development of new technologies involves a high degree of risk and there is no assurance that our development activities will result in a commercially viable product. The long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, directly related to the cost and success of our development programs, which may be affected by a number of factors.

&#160;

The average adult human has a skin surface area of between 16 - 21 square feet, which protects all other organs against the external environment. When a person's skin is assailed by trauma or exposed to extreme heat, the skin's various layers may be destroyed and depending on the severity of the injury, might cause life-threatening conditions. Currently, severe trauma to the skin, such as second or third degree burns, requires surgical mesh-grafting of skin, whereby healthy skin is removed from one area of the patient's body (a " donor site ") and implanted on the damaged area. While mesh grafting is often the method of choice, there are significant deficiencies with this method. The surgical procedure to remove healthy skin from the donor site can be painful and leaves the patient with a new wound that must also be attended to. In many instances the aesthetic results are not satisfying, as the color of the skin from the donor site may not match the skin color of the damaged skin. Additionally, since the ratio between the size of the wound area and the size of the donor site is quite low, i.e. the size of the skin removed must be substantially equal in size to the size of the damaged skin, the mesh-grafting approach is in many cases limited. Donor and injury sites can take weeks to heal, requiring expensive hospital stays, ongoing wound dressing management, and ever-changing anti-infection strategies.

&#160;

We are currently evaluating the efficacy and potential of our SkinGun TM , in combination with our unique cell isolation method, in the treatment of tissue that has been subject to severe trauma such as second and third degree burns. In small scale clinical case studies the SkinGun TM and cell isolation methodology has shown the ability to regenerate a more natural and thicker skin. The SkinGun TM utilizes the patient's own skin stem cells and is able to address much larger treatment areas and at the same time reduce the size of the donor site. Furthermore, we believe the SkinGun TM enables the effective treatment of other skin disorders with minimal scarring compared to skin grafting. &#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160;

Domestic Regulation 

&#160;

Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products or devices and cellular therapy systems such as those we are attempting to develop. Our device candidates, to the extent they are developed, will be subject to 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval by the FDA prior to their marketing for commercial use in the United States, and to any approvals required by foreign governmental entities prior to their marketing outside the United States. In addition, any changes or modifications to a device that has received regulatory clearance or approval that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or would constitute a major change in its intended use, may require the submission of a new application for 510(k) clearance, pre-market approval or foreign regulatory approvals.

&#160;

The 510(k) clearance and pre-market approval processes, as well as the process of obtaining foreign approvals, can be expensive, time consuming and uncertain. It generally takes from four to twelve months from submission to obtain 510(k) clearance, and from one to three years from submission to obtain pre-market approval; however, it may take longer, and 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval may never be obtained. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, clearances or approvals for future products, including tests that are currently in design or development, would result in delayed, or no, realization of revenues from such products and in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability. We have not yet submitted any devices for 510(k) clearance and there are no guarantees that we will make such a submission or that if we do our submission will be approved.

&#160;

HIPAA Requirements 

&#160;

Other federal legislation may affect our ability to obtain certain health information in conjunction with any research activities we conduct. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (" HIPAA "), mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards designed to safeguard the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. In relevant part, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (" HHS "), has released two rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to such health information. The first rule imposes new standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information. These standards restrict the manner and circumstances under which covered entities may use and disclose protected health information so as to protect the privacy of that information. The second rule released by HHS establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information. While we do not believe we are directly regulated as a covered entity under HIPAA, the HIPAA standards impose requirements on covered entities conducting research activities regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected in the course of conducting the research. 

&#160;

Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements 

&#160;

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the Food and Drug Administration (" FDA "), including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws. &#160;

&#160;

International Regulation 

&#160;

The regulation of any potential product candidates we may produce outside of the United States varies by country. Certain countries regulate human tissue products as a pharmaceutical product, which would require us to make extensive filings and obtain regulatory approvals before selling our product candidates. Certain other countries may classify our product candidates as human tissue for transplantation but may restrict its import or sale. Other countries have no application regulations regarding the import or sale of products similar to potential product candidates, creating uncertainty as to what standards we may be required to meet.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical and wound care industries are characterized by intense competition, rapid product development and technological change. Our SkinGun TM competes with a variety of companies in the wound care markets, many of which offer substantially different treatments for similar problems. Currently Avita Medical Limited is evaluating the efficacy of ReCell &#210; , a cell spray device and a cell isolation procedure for autologous cells. Integra Lifesciences Holding Corp. sells Integra &#210; Dermal Regeneration Template, which does not use autologous cells, but instead uses an animal-derived intercellular matrix with an artificial waterproof barrier. Other competitors include: MiMedx Group, Inc.; KCI. Fibrocell Science, Inc.; Shire Plc and Organogenesis, Inc.

&#160;

Many of our competitors are large, well-established pharmaceutical, chemical, cosmetic or health care companies with considerably greater financial, marketing, sales and technical resources than those available to us. Additionally, many of our present and potential competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with our product lines. Our potential products could be rendered obsolete or made uneconomical by the development of new products to treat the conditions addressed by our products, technological advances affecting the cost of production, or marketing or pricing actions by one or more of our competitors.

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

Our ultimate goal is to leverage the potential of our SkinGun TM , together with our cell isolation method, as cutting edge treatments in skin therapy. Before we can do so, however, there are a number of steps we must first take, including:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

initiating a series of clinical trials to determine the SkinGun TM 's efficacy for treating wounds and burns;

&#160;

&#183; 

expanding the range of possible applications;

&#160;

&#183; 

formalizing collaborations with universities and scientific partners;

&#160;

&#183; 

creating a network of clinical and research partners; and

&#160;

&#183; 

achieving FDA and other regulatory clearance/approval.

&#160;

Additionally, we will likely be required to raise significant capital in order to fund our ongoing research and development operations, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise on acceptable terms, if at all.

&#160;

Operations 

&#160;

We expect to be engaged in research and development activities for the foreseeable future.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have one full time employee, Mr. Drew Danielson, Director of Operations, and five part-time contractors: Mr. Thomas Bold, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ms. Rhonda B. Rosen, Chief Financial Officer; Ms. Patsy Trisler, Vice-President Clinical &#38; Regulatory Affairs; Ms. Patricia Jeanne Riley, Vice-President Commercial Strategy and Ms. Michaela Purcell. &#160;
