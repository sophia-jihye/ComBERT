DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Unless otherwise noted, the terms "GTX Corp", the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" refer to the ongoing business operations of GTX Corp and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Global Trek Xploration, and LOCiMOBILE, Inc. During 2014, we owned Code Amber News Service, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary that was discontinued in February 2015. Accordingly, unless otherwise specified, references to the "Company", "we", "us", and "our" for periods before February 2015 also refer to, and include Code Amber News Service, Inc. 

OVERVIEW OF THE BUSINESS 

GTX Corp is a holding company that currently owns and operates two subsidiaries engaged in the growing $17 billion wearable technology business. GTX was founded in 2002, became publicly traded in 2008, and is currently headquartered in Los Angeles, California.

GTX provides a global monitoring platform that answers the &#147;where is&#148; question: such as, where is my mother, child, employee, pet, drone, or high value asset. Through a proprietary IoT (&#147;Internet of Things&#148;) enterprise platform the Company provides a licensing, subscription based recurring revenue business model and offers a complete end to end solution of location based hardware, middleware, apps, connectivity and professional services. Letting you know where or how someone or something is at the touch of a button, delivering security and peace of mind in real-time.

Since the inception of our business, GTX Corp has developed and commercially launched several products, including our most recent GPS and BLE SmartSoles with a hosted and scalable backend monitoring platform and more than 20 smartphone and tablet Apps. The Company has five revenue streams comprising of product sales, recurring subscriptions, licensing, advertising, and professional services. These core products and services are supported by GTX&#146;s intellectual property (IP) portfolio of issued patents, licensed patents, patents pending, registered trademarks, copyrights, URLs and a library of proprietary hardware and software. 

There are 3 primary market segments we sell our monitoring products and services into, 1) people with cognitive memory disorders, such as Alzheimer&#146;s, dementia, autism and traumatic brain injury (&#147;TBI&#148;). Typically, these people have a tendency to wander and require remote oversight. In accordance with the 2014 Alzheimer&#146;s disease Facts and Figures, in 2014 there were an estimated 5.2 million people in the United States with Alzheimer&#146;s disease and approximately 13.9% of people age 71 and older in the United States have dementia. 2) High Value assets, such as drones, cargo and fleet management. 3) Mobile work force, such as salespersons, journalists, electricians, plumbers, food delivery, law enforcement and a host of other industries that require knowing the whereabouts of an employee in real time. 

Our operations are currently conducted through the following two wholly-owned subsidiaries that operate in various interrelated sectors of the emerging Location-Based wearable technology market. 

GTX Corp and its subsidiaries (Global Trek Xploration, Inc. and LOCiMOBILE, Inc.) are engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, distribution and sales of five (5) related products and services in the GPS and BLE wearable technology personal location and wandering assistive technology business. Through a proprietary enterprise (IoT) monitoring platform and licensing subscription business model, the Company offers a complete end to end solution of hardware, middleware, apps, connectivity, and professional services, letting you know where or how someone or something is at the touch of a button, delivering safety, security and peace of mind in real-time.

Since the start of 2015 the Company has focused on building channels of distribution for its product lines of embedded devices, Stand-Alone devices and Digital Apps which all funnel into the GTX Corp IoT monitoring platform. Each product line is sold both direct to consumer (B2C) and business to business (B2B) through a global network of resellers, affiliates, distributors, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, manufacturers reps and retailers. The Company has been ramping up its product distribution and sales channels and, as of December 31, 2015, the Company had live units in the field and / or paying subscribers in over 35 countries, had 10 regional sales reps in the US, 6 retired and active professional athlete brand ambassadors, over 225 online affiliates, products being sold in 2 retail stores, 13 international distributors, and a joint venture distribution agreement in Ireland. Also we were issued a vendor number for reimbursement in 5 U.S. states, and have applied for other State and Federal reimbursement codes, grants and private insurance reimbursement, which if granted is expected to increase the potential market for users of our SmartSole product line.

All product lines are sold with a monthly, quarterly or annual subscription service plan ranging from $5 to $49 per month and licensing plans with over 2,000 worldwide subscribers as of December 31, 2015. 

Global Trek Xploration (&#147;GTX California&#148;) 

Our GTX California subsidiary engages in the business of hardware, software, connectivity, design and development of GPS and Bluetooth low energy (&#147;BLE&#148;) monitoring and tracking solutions. This includes the management and monetization of the Company&#146;s IP portfolio. Offering a GPS and cellular location platform that enables subscribers to track in real time the whereabouts of people, or high valued assets. Our proprietary GPS device, which consists of a miniature quad band GPRS transceiver, antenna, circuitry, battery and inductive charging pad can be customized and integrated into numerous form factors whose location and movement can be monitored in real time over the Internet through our 24x7 tracking portal or on a web enabled cellular telephone. The tracking portal is fully scalable and has been licensed to several partners both in the U.S. and internationally. It is a secure platform equipped with a database, application-programming interface (&#147;API&#148;) for custom integration and communication SMS gateway software and hardware. Subscriber internet communications are routed through GTX California&#146;s proprietary, fault-tolerant, carrier-class, and application-specific interface software. Our Location Data Center services are also offered to non-GTX California products and hardware systems (i.e. handsets and personal electronics) of major electronics manufacturers through the offer and sale of exclusive licenses (either geographical, regional or product categories).

&#160;

Each module is programmed with a unique identification number and uses standard cellular frequencies to communicate its location. The module is also programmed with a unique subscriber identification number allowing each owner to subscribe to different services.

&#160;

GTX California has developed a &#147;carrier-class&#148; architecture and hosts the servers in a facility Data Center (reliable to 99.999%). The local service center runs on redundant off-the-shelf servers. This enables cost-efficient expansion, without the need for application code changes.

&#160;

The products are supported by the existing infrastructure for the worldwide cell network that provides coverage throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and numerous other countries that operate on the global GSM Wireless networks. In addition, the personal locators will have the ability to roam seamlessly on the networks of 290 partners in over 210 countries.

As part of our expansion strategy/roadmap, the Company is currently exploring the development of a Code Division Multiple Access (&#147;CDMA&#148;) module that should open up new carrier relationships and territories that are predominantly CDMA, such as Japan and Korea.

Strategic Relationships and Licensing Arrangements 

The main initiatives of GTX California is to offer location based hardware and/or its data monitoring platform to third parties for the sale and distribution of location based products/services in various markets. We begin the process by entering into a platform test agreement or pilot program with a potential partner with the intent to transition into a long term relationship. By establishing and building partnerships, through licensing agreements, OEM, and carrier relationships, we facilitate efficient entry into new markets leveraging each company&#146;s core competencies. We enhance the value of our distribution channels by aligning our sales and marketing efforts with strategic partners, including co-branding, distribution and marketing with telecommunication companies, wireless carriers, national retailers and major consumer branded companies.

GTX California has the ability to customize its products to different form factors for the specific needs of its customers. To date, the Company has created three custom solutions: 1) the monitoring of seniors by installing the GPS device into specially designed shoes and insoles; 2) the monitoring of children by installing the GPS device into specially designed shoes and backpacks; and 3) the monitoring of various high value assets such as drones and other mobile assets. 

The Company has several key strategic relationships established both on the supply side and the distribution side. Some of the key partners on the supply side are Atlantic Footcare, which manufactures our SmartSoles, Telic which manufactures our GPS and Cellular electronics and Telefonica which provides our global connectivity. On the distribution side we have numerous partnerships worldwide, ranging from distributors, health organizations, and retailers.

In June of 2015, we entered into an agreement with Alroni to handle warehousing and distribution for our European business. We ship inventory to Alroni in Ireland and they in turn handle B2C sales and fulfillment for Ireland and the U.K. and fulfillment for the certain countries in Europe. We utilize a revenue share model on what is shipped, hence having no fixed overhead cost for the warehousing of inventory. This agreement has enabled the Company to have a European presence without the associated overhead costs.

In September of 2015, we signed a global connectivity agreement with, Telef&#243;nica, S.A, enabling our products to operate in over 100 countries with flat rate pricing. In addition to proving us a global connectivity platform Telefonica has been instrumental in opening sales channels throughout Europe and Latin America for us. Telef&#243;nica, S.A. is a Spanish broadband and telecommunications provider with operations in Europe, Asia, and North, Central and South America. Operating globally, it is one of the largest telephone operators and mobile network providers in the world with revenues exceeding 58 billion USD. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.

Throughout 2015 the Company signed up 4 retired and active professional NFL players as brand ambassadors; Sidney Rice, Clinton Portis, Jason Fox and Collin McCarthy.

During 2013, we entered into an exclusive three-year manufacturing contract with Atlantic Footcare, Inc., (&#147;Atlantic&#148;) to develop and launch the GPS SmartSole &#174; (the &#147;SmartSole&#148;). Atlantic is the Company&#146;s exclusive manufacturer of our GPS and BLE SmartSoles. 

The Company is constantly engaging in new pilot programs domestically and internationally with these pilot programs being conducted by assisted living facilities, Government and Municipal agencies, Police departments, health organizations, retailers, distributors, universities; non-profits, special needs schools and independent sales organizations. The pilot programs generally last 2 to 4 months with a constant rotation of some pilots converting to commercial rollouts and new pilots coming in. 

Designed for less chronic wanderers and as an introduction to our other footwear-based location monitoring products, in March 2015 we introduced the Bluetooth Low Energy (&#147;BLE&#148;) SmartSoles, a footwear system designed to monitor when the wearer enters or leaves a room or building. The BLE SmartSoles were specifically designed based on the needs of assisted living facilities and indoor monitoring and tracking. Similar to the GPS SmartSole, the BLE SmartSole looks and feels like a regular insole, may be placed in most shoes and trimmed to fit. The BLE SmartSole is embedded with a miniaturized low energy Bluetooth chip that reports when the user crosses a virtual perimeter. The BLE SmartSole has a battery life of over one year, alleviating the caregiver from the worry of recharging or replacing batteries. The technology is customizable for personal home use or commercial assisted living facilities and the caregiver is alerted via email or text when the wearer leaves the area.

Both the GPS and BLE SmartSoles are offered for sale on our www.gtxcorp.com and www.gpssmartsole.com websites and over 225 online affiliates for $299 and $49 each, with several monthly and quarterly subscription plans available ranging from $5 to $75.

On February 15, 2013, June 26, 2013 and July 15, 2014, the Company entered into three separate one-year advisory service agreements with Brewer Sports International, LLC (&#147;BSI&#148;) (the &#147;Advisory Agreements&#148;). The goal of the Advisory Agreements is to increase our brand and market awareness in an effort to increase sales, expand our sales network and become associated with contacts of BSI with respect to achieving these objectives. BSI will utilize its extensive network to facilitate outreach efforts with synergetic companies and partnering organizations as well as secure product endorsements and global exposure for our product line. BSI has included the Company in its Traumatic Brain Injury awareness conference and expanded its social media awareness programs relative to this issue and the products and services offered by the Company. We have extended the agreement for an additional year through July 15, 2016.

LOCiMOBILE, Inc. 

LOCiMOBILE, Inc., our mobile application subsidiary, developed and owns LOCiMOBILE&#174;, a suite of mobile tracking applications (&#147;Apps&#148;) that turn the latest Smartphones and tablets such as iPhone&#174;, iPad, Google Android and other GPS enabled handsets into a tracking and location based social networking device which can be viewed through our tracking portal or on any connected device with internet access.

&#160;

THE INDUSTRY 

&#160;

Smart technology is becoming the norm and it is starting to find its way into all parts of society. Miniature electronic devices that are worn by a person, commonly referred to as wearables, are a big and emerging part of the smart technology landscape for 2016. Wearable Technology is on the rise in personal fitness, wellness, healthcare and business use. 2016 CES was a record breaking year. More than 170,000 attendees from across the globe gathered amongst 2.47 million net square feet of exhibit space.

The Caregiving Innovation Frontiers (CIF) study found that an estimated 117 million Americans will need assistance of some kind by 2020, but the number of unpaid caregivers is only expected to reach 45 million in the same year. These unpaid caregivers are avid for solutions to assist them, and tech entrepreneurs already are stepping up to the plate. This huge demand represents a $279 billion revenue opportunity over the next four years across six different business areas identified in the study, with 80% of spending being out-of-pocket costs. Technology solutions and remote health monitoring systems that enable family caregivers could provide key relief, according to the report. The CIF report outlined six areas for business opportunities, with huge potential for revenue grabs. Technology represents an opportunity across all the service areas, according to AARP. The majority of family caregivers&#151;67% of them&#151;want to use technology to monitor their loved one&#146;s health and safety, but only about 10% are doing so right now, leaving a lot of room for growth. 

In our ever-mobile society, it helps to know where we are and where we are going. Same with caregivers of seniors suffering from Alzheimer&#146;s and dementia, freight forwarding companies wanting to know where their packages are, and employers want to know where their field workers are. Many parents desire to have the ability to know where their children are and where they are going. Having such information is now possible with access to real-time information delivered on-demand through locator systems and technologies such as ours.

The rising need for two-way GPS and location based services is influenced by several factors, among them:

&#183;

Universal awareness and expanding penetration of GPS enabled mobile smartphones &#38; tablets (estimated 2 billion shipments worldwide in 2015). 

&#183;

Personal and asset security concerns affecting a greater portion of the population. This includes the increased awareness related to Global Terrorism and unrest. 

&#183;

Increasing numbers of elderly or memory impaired (Alzheimer&#146;s, dementia, autism, etc. 9 million in U.S. and growing to 277 million worldwide by 2050). 

&#183;

Corporations needing to manage worker productivity and logistics.

&#183;

Government agencies, law enforcement and military personnel monitoring.

&#183;

Massive life style adoption of Location Based Social Networking.

&#183;

Proximity Advertising - the new standard.

GROWTH STRATEGY 

&#160;

We are engaged in a two-pronged business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) go-to-market strategy. Our goal is to become one of the major providers of personal monitoring and asset location services within specific markets. Once we hit critical mass in pricing, we will expand into the mass consumer markets. The strategy is to establish licensing relationships with key industry partners who will embed our technology into their products to sell to their established customer base. Key elements of our strategy include:

&#183;

Providing our Personal Locator embedded module to licensees to empower their products with our two-way GPS tracking capabilities;

&#183;

Providing B2B hardware leasing programs;

&#183;

OEM private label manufacturing;

&#183;

A mass market retail price under $199.00 for Personal Location devices;

&#183;

A monthly service fee structure, under $20.00, having multiple convenient access points (mobile phone, land line, or via the Internet); and

&#183;

Ease of use at the location interface point as well as with the device, using state-of-the-art cloud computing and cloud application development.

&#160;

COMPETITION 

Personal location and property tracking devices of various kinds are currently available from various vendors, and the number of competitive products is increasing rapidly in the marketplace. Nevertheless, we believe this rapidly growing market acceptance of tracking solutions represents a tremendous opportunity as the intrinsic value of the tracking solutions is recognized and mass market adoption continues. The key competitive advantage for GTX in its lead SmartSole product is our innovative approach to embedding electronics inside a flexible footwear system, which advantage is protected by an extensive patent portfolio.

Key differentiators between ourselves and the competition is:

B2B:

&#183;

Providing a comprehensive end-to-end solution comprised of hardware, software, and global connectivity, and

&#183;

The ability to strategically align ourselves with partners to embed our technology through OEM or private label programs.

B2C:

&#183;

Is that our BLE &#38; GPS SmartSole is the only non-visible, non-intrusive solution.

&#160;

There are numerous competitors for GPS products and our LOCiMOBILE &#174; smart phone applications, including Location Based Technologies, Inc., Google Latitude, Foursquare, Trimble Navigation, Inc., Brick House Security and SOS GPS, Inc.

Many of our competitors are better financed than we are and/or have greater marketing and scientific resources than we can provide. We are also aware of a number of foreign competitors that offer less expensive personal location tracking products.

&#160;

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160;

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations applied to businesses generally as well as FCC, IC and CE wireless device regulations and controls. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in all relevant jurisdictions. We do not believe that our operations are subject to any environmental laws and regulations of the United States nor the states in which they operate. 

&#160;

OTHER LOCATION PRODUCTS 

In addition to marketing our own proprietary products such as the GPS and BLE SmartSole, we also market and sell the line of Prime tracking devices that are manufactured by third party suppliers. The Prime is a compact, fully certified quad-band integrated device that provides complete GSM/GPRS functionality for mobile tracking applications, which is waterproof, shock proof and comes with an SOS button. We primarily sell this product to a customer in the drone industry. These products are sold under our GTX brand, and they can be branded with other companies&#146; names. All these devices operate through, and use our middleware platform and viewing portal. We retail sell these devices on Amazon.com to individuals and wholesale as a complete solution including platform and wireless connectivity, providing us with product sales revenues and subsequent recurring monthly service revenues. In addition to hardware device sales, as part of our international expansion plans, we are also licensing our enterprise portal and middleware platform, which contributes to an increase in our monthly subscription revenues. Currently we have three international platform license partners operating our backend in their respective country- Nepal, Mexico and Australia.

EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had ten employees, eight advisors and over two dozen independent contractors and sales personnel. Any selling, marketing, technical, IT and/or software development work that is not handled by our employees is outsourced to qualified contractors and consultants as deemed necessary.
