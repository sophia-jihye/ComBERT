 Item 1 . Business Business Development 

The Company was organized as a business corporation under the laws of Rhode Island in 1983 as Providence and Worcester Company and is the successor by merger in 1983 to a corporation also named Providence and Worcester Company which was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1979. In 1984, the Company&#146;s name was changed to Capital Properties, Inc. 

Segments 

The Company operates in two segments: leasing and petroleum storage. For financial information, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 

Leasing 

Capital Center 

The leasing segment is principally devoted to the leasing of Company-owned land in the Capital Center area (&#147;Capital Center&#148;) in downtown Providence, Rhode Island under long-term ground leases. The Company owns approximately 18 acres in the Capital Center consisting of 13 individual parcels. The Capital Center (approximately 77 acres of land) is the result of a development project undertaken by the State of Rhode Island, the City of Providence, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (&#147;Amtrak&#148;) and the Company during the 1980&#146;s in which two rivers, the Moshassuck and the Woonasquatucket, were moved, Amtrak&#146;s Northeast Corridor rail line was relocated, a new Amtrak/commuter railroad station was constructed and significant public improvements were made to improve pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area. 

With the exception of the Steeple Street property, the Company has not acted, and does not intend to act, as a developer with respect to any improvements constructed on Company-owned parcels. Rather, the Company offers individual parcels for lease pursuant to long-term ground leases with terms of 99 years or more. Each lease contains provisions permitting the tenant to develop the parcel under certain terms and conditions. Each lease provides for periodic rent adjustments of various kinds. Under the leases, the tenants are responsible for insuring the Company against various hazards and events. Each tenant is required to indemnify the Company with respect to all of the tenant&#146;s activities on the land. The leases contain other terms and conditions customary to such instruments. 

The Company first began offering parcels for lease in the Capital Center area in the late 1980&#146;s. As of December 31, 2015, nine parcels have been leased by the Company under long-term leases of 99 years or more. Of the nine parcels, 

&#160; 

seven have improvements constructed thereon as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 13-story office building (235,000 gross square feet) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 8-story 225-unit residential building (454,000 gross square feet) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4-story office building (114,000 gross square feet) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 10-story office building (210,000 gross square feet) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 17-story and 19-story residential buildings containing 193 units (307,000 gross square feet) and a 13-story office building (325,000 gross square feet) 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 4-story 96-unit residential building (120,000 gross square feet) and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; 330-car public parking garage. 

While seeking developers, the Company also leases Parcels 3E, 3W, 4E and 4W in the Capital Center area for public parking purposes on a short-term basis to Metropark, Ltd. 

Parcel 20 Adjacent to the Capital Center 

Since the 1980&#146;s, the Company has owned an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the Capital Center, which is leased out for public parking purposes on a short-term basis. In 2007, the Company purchased the adjacent parcel containing a three/four-story 18,000 square foot building (the &#147;Steeple Street Building&#148;) and related land for $2,329,000, which, together with the previously-owned land, now comprises Parcel 20, containing 26,600 square feet. The Steeple Street Building is on the State Registry of Historic Buildings. During 2010-11, the Company substantially rehabilitated the Building. The Building has four commercial tenants with additional space available for lease. 

All of the properties described above are shown on a map contained in Exhibit 20.1. 

Lamar Lease 

The Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, leases 23 outdoor advertising locations containing 44 billboard faces along interstate and primary highways in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to Lamar Outdoor Advertising, LLC (&#147;Lamar&#148;) under a lease which now expires in 2045. All but one of these locations are controlled by the Company through permanent easements granted to the Company pursuant to an agreement between the Company and Providence &#38; Worcester Railroad Company, a related company (&#147;Railroad&#148;); the remaining location is leased by the Company from a third party with a remaining term of four years. 

Although no new locations have been added since 2002, in 2013 Lamar converted billboards at two locations to electronic boards, which conversions extended the term of the lease for a total of twelve years to 2045. Lamar has a right of first refusal for additional billboard location sites acquired by the Company in New England and Metropolitan New York City. 

The lease with Lamar provides, among other things, for the following: (1) the base rent increases annually at the rate of 2.75% for each leased billboard location commencing June 1, 2006 and on each June 1 thereafter; and (2) in addition to base rent, for each 12-month period commencing each June 1, Lamar must pay to the Company 30% of the gross revenues from each standard billboard and 20% of the gross revenues from each electronic billboard for such 12-month period, reduced by the sum of (a) commissions paid to third parties and (b) the base monthly rent for each leased billboard display for such 12-month period. The Lamar lease contains other terms and conditions customary to such instruments. 

The Company has the right to require the Railroad to grant to it additional permanent easements for the location of billboards along the Railroad&#146;s right-of-way on commercially reasonable terms.

&#160; Competition 

The Company competes for tenants with other owners of undeveloped real property in downtown Providence. The Company maintains no listing of other competitive properties and will not engage in a competitive bid arrangement with proposed developers. The Company&#146;s refusal to sell the land that it owns may restrict the number of interested developers. As to the Steeple Street Building, the Company competes for tenants with other office and commercial buildings located in downtown Providence. 

&#160; 

Employees 

The leasing segment has two employees. 

Petroleum Storage 

Terminal and Pier Facility 

The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dunellen, LLC, owns a petroleum storage terminal containing 1,004,000 shell barrels (the &#147;Terminal&#148;) and the Wilkesbarre Pier (the &#147;Pier&#148;), collectively referred to as the &#147;Facility,&#148; located in East Providence, Rhode Island. The Terminal utilizes the Pier and pipelines connecting the Pier to the Terminal. 

Leasing of the Facility 

For the first four months of 2014, the Company leased a portion of the Facility (425,000 shell barrels) to Atlantic Trading &#38; Marketing, Inc. which vacated the Facility on April 30, 2014. 

On May 1, 2014, the Company entered into a Petroleum Storage Services Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with Sprague Operating Resources, LLC (&#147;Sprague&#148;) for the lease of its entire storage capacity of 1,004,000 barrels for a term of five years. The base rent is $3,500,000, subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments on May 1 of each year. In addition, the Company will receive an additional $.15 for each barrel of throughput at the Facility in excess of 3,500,000 barrels in any contract year (May 1 to April 30). Sprague has the right to extend the Agreement for two additional terms of five years each, provided that Sprague gives at least twelve months&#146; notice prior to the expiration of the initial or the extension term, as applicable. Commencing April 1, 2016 and on each April 1 thereafter during the initial term and any extension term, either party during the following thirty days has the right to terminate the Agreement as of April 30 of the year next following the year in which notice of termination is given. Commencing May 1, 2015, Sprague will reimburse the Company for any real property taxes in excess of $290,000. The Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions. 

Environmental 

The operation of a petroleum storage facility carries with it the risk of environmental contamination. 

Environmental incident (2002) 

In 2002, during testing of monitoring wells at the Terminal, the Company&#146;s consulting engineer discovered free floating phase product in a groundwater monitoring well located on that portion of the Terminal purchased in 2000. Laboratory analysis indicated that the product was gasoline, which is not a product the Company ever stored at the Terminal. The Company commenced an environmental investigation and analysis, the results of which indicate that the gasoline did not come from the Terminal. The Company notified the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (&#147;RIDEM&#148;). RIDEM subsequently identified Power Test Realty Partnership (&#147;Power Test&#148;), the owner of an adjacent parcel, as a potentially responsible party for the contamination. Getty Properties Corp. is the general partner of Power Test. Power Test challenged that determination and, after an administrative hearing, in October 2008 a RIDEM Hearing Officer determined that Power Test is responsible for the discharge of the petroleum product under the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, R.I.G.L. Section 46-12.5.1-3 and Rule 6(a) and 12(b) of the Oil Pollution Control Regulations. The RIDEM Decision and Order requires Power Test to remediate the contamination as directed by RIDEM and remanded the proposed penalty to RIDEM for recalculation. In November 2008, Power Test appealed the decision to the Rhode Island Superior Court. In addition, in November 2008, Power Test sought, and received, a stay of the Decision and Order of the Hearing Officer pending a clarification by RIDEM of the amount of the proposed penalty. In October 2009, RIDEM issued a recalculated administrative penalty, and, subsequently, the RIDEM Hearing Officer issued a recommended amended decision, which was affirmed as a final decision by the RIDEM Director in December 2009. In January 2010, Power Test appealed that decision to Superior Court. In September 2011, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the RIDEM director. Power Test has appealed that decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. On March 4, 2016 the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Superior Court and the 2009 decision of the RIDEM Director. 

In April 2009, the Company sued Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. in the Rhode Island Superior Court seeking remediation of the site or, in the alternative, the cost of the remediation. On May 1, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. removed the action to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island (&#147;the Court&#148;). On May 22, 2009, Power Test and Getty Properties Corp. answered the Complaint and filed a Counterclaim against Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company alleging that Dunellen, LLC and Capital Terminal Company are responsible for the contamination. Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test joined Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc., the tenant under a long-term lease with Getty Properties Corp. of the adjacent property, as a defendant. The Company amended its Complaint to add Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. as a defendant. Getty Petroleum 

&#160; 

Marketing, Inc. moved for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test. On December 5, 2011, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Act. Thereafter, with Bankruptcy Court approval, Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. rejected its lease with Getty Properties Corp. On August 24, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved a plan to liquidate Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. On January 15, 2013, the Court granted Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc.&#146;s motion for summary judgment against the Company, Getty Properties Corp. and Power Test, dismissing the Company&#146;s third-party complaint. 

The parties have agreed to stay the litigation pending a determination by the Rhode Island Supreme Court on the Power Test appeal. The Company is in the process of evaluating its position in the light of the Rhode Island Supreme Court decision referred to above. 

Since January 2003, the Company has not incurred significant costs in connection with this matter, other than ongoing litigation costs, and is unable to determine the costs it might incur to remedy the situation, as well as any costs to investigate, defend and seek reimbursement from the responsible party with respect to this contamination. 

Environmental remediation (1994) 

In 1994, a leak was discovered in a 25,000 barrel storage tank at the Terminal which allowed the escape of a small amount of fuel oil. All required notices were made to RIDEM. In 2000, the tank was demolished and testing of the groundwater indicated that there was no large pooling of contaminants. In 2001, RIDEM approved a plan pursuant to which the Company installed a passive system consisting of three wells and commenced monitoring the wells. 

In 2003, RIDEM decided that the passive monitoring system previously approved was not sufficient and required the Company to design an active remediation system for the removal of product from the contaminated site. The Company and its consulting engineers began the pre-design testing of the site in the fourth quarter of 2004. The consulting engineers estimated a total cost of $200,000 to design, install and operate the system, which amount was accrued in 2004. Through 2006, the Company had expended $119,000 and has not incurred any significant costs since then. In 2011, RIDEM notified the Company to proceed with the next phase of the approval process, notifying the abutters of the proposed remediation system even though RIDEM has not yet taken any action on the Company&#146;s proposed plan. As designed, the system will pump out the contaminants which will be disposed of in compliance with applicable regulations. After a period of time, the groundwater will be tested to determine if sufficient contaminants have been removed. In 2014, the Company engaged new consultants to work with RIDEM to develop the next phase of the approval process. While the Company and its consulting engineers believe that the proposed active remediation system will correct the situation, it is possible that RIDEM could require the Company to expand remediation efforts, which could result in the Company incurring costs in excess of the remaining accrual of $79,000. 

The Company manages its exposure to contamination, remediation or similar costs associated with the Facility through adherence to established procedures for operations and equipment maintenance. 

Insurance 

The Company maintains what management believes to be adequate levels of insurance, including environmental insurance. 

Competition 

The Facility competes with several other similar facilities located on and adjacent to the Providence Harbor. The Terminal has approximately 48% of the total distillate storage capacity in the Providence area. The current tenant, Sprague, competes with other terminal operators on the basis of price, availability and a willingness to advance credit to local wholesalers. The amount of petroleum throughput at the Terminal is a function of Sprague&#146;s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and the amount of product Sprague sells at its City of Providence terminal. 

Employees 

The Terminal employs eight people on a full-time basis.
