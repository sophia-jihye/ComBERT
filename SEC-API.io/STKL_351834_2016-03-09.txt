 Item 1. Business 

INTRODUCTION 

SunOpta, a corporation organized under the laws of Canada in 1973, is a leading global company operating businesses focused on a healthy products portfolio that promotes sustainable well-being. We are focused on both sourcing non-genetically modified (&#147;non-GMO&#148;) and organic ingredients and manufacturing healthy food and beverage products. We operate an integrated &#147;field-to-table&#148; business model leveraging our global ingredient sourcing platform to process and market non-GMO and organic ingredients for retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice operators and manufacture packaged products focused on the high growth healthy beverages, healthy fruit and healthy snacks categories for our retail, foodservice and branded food customers. We believe we are a North American market leader in non-dairy organic aseptic beverages, premium refrigerated private label orange juice, individually quick frozen (&#147;IQF&#148;) organic fruit, healthy premium fruit snacks, and the global sourcing and supply of non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients. Our scalable global sourcing platform makes us one of the leading suppliers of non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients in the food industry, and provides us leading insights into emerging food and beverage trends. Our product portfolio is strategically aligned with the fast-growing consumer demand for high quality, healthy non-GMO and organic food and beverage products.

Our vertically integrated business model makes us a preferred partner to our retail (e.g., grocery, mass, club, natural and specialty chains), foodservice and branded food customers. We deliver a diverse, innovative portfolio of high quality, food and beverage products supported by our global sourcing platform, scalable operating footprint, manufacturing expertise and commitment to innovation. This platform enables us to consistently supply our customers with a broad range of non-GMO and organic ingredients as well as high quality healthy food and beverage products that cater to the evolving demands of today&#146;s consumers. As a leading supplier of non-GMO and organic ingredients to the food industry, we leverage our insights into emerging consumer tastes and preferences to develop innovative new food and beverage products. 

Our Product Portfolio 

Our diverse product portfolio utilizes non-GMO and organic raw materials and ingredients that are sourced primarily by our vertically integrated global ingredients capabilities, and consists of three main commercial platforms:

&#160; &#149; Healthy Beverages &#150; We offer a full line of aseptic beverages, including non-dairy beverages (e.g., soy, almond, coconut, rice and others), nutritional beverages, dairy beverages, broths and teas. We also offer refrigerated premium juices, shelf-stable juices and functional waters. We believe we are the leading North American provider of non-dairy organic aseptic beverages as well as premium refrigerated private label organic orange juice following our acquisition of Citrusource. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Healthy Fruit &#150; We offer IQF fruit for retail (e.g., strawberries, blueberries, mango, pineapple, blends and other berries and fruit), IQF and bulk frozen fruit for foodservice (e.g., pur&#233;es, fruit cups and smoothies) and fruit ingredients. We believe we are currently a leading North American provider of private label organic IQF fruit and, with the acquisition of Sunrise, we believe we are the North American market leader in both non-GMO and organic private label IQF fruit. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Healthy Snacks &#150; We offer fruit snacks (including bars, twists, rope and bite-sized varieties), roasted snacks, nutritional bars, and re-sealable pouch products (e.g., baby food, puddings, sauces and other healthy snacks). We believe we are a leading North American provider of premium healthy fruit snacks, which was further strengthened with the acquisition of Niagara Natural. 

Our global ingredients platform is focused on the procurement and sale of non-GMO and organic grains and seeds (including ancient grains and seeds), fruits, vegetables, sweeteners, coffees, nuts and other products as ingredients in both raw material and processed ingredient forms. In addition to supplying our own healthy food and beverage product portfolio, we are a leading supplier of raw materials and processed ingredients to a number of global food manufacturers and foodservice operators. Our vertically integrated model allows us to leverage our scalable and diverse supply of high quality non-GMO and organic ingredients, adding value to a product at multiple stages of the supply chain and delivering comprehensive non-GMO and organic food ingredients and packaged goods solutions to our customers&#146; evolving demands. This model allows us to provide our global ingredients customers with high quality healthy food and beverage products.

SUNOPTA INC. 5 January 2, 2016 10-K Using our vertically integrated business model, we process non-GMO and organic food ingredients into consumer packaged products, primarily healthy beverages, healthy fruit and healthy snacks. Our food ingredients are converted from raw materials, and our raw materials are sourced from approximately 5,000 suppliers encompassing approximately 10,000 growers in over 65 countries. Our employees and assets, which include 27 processing and packaging facilities, are principally located in North America and Europe with smaller sourcing and processing operations in Africa and China. Our operations and capabilities provide the flexibility to modify our product portfolio to adapt to the changing consumer needs for non-GMO and organic food and beverage products. As a general principle, we do not own or operate our own farms, retail stores, or extensively market our own consumer brands. 

Our commitment and proactive approach to new product development and innovation drives our ability to introduce new higher margin food and beverage products to the market. In June 2015, we expanded our research and development platform by opening an advanced innovation center in Edina, Minnesota. This facility supports our dedicated team of food scientists, engineers and technicians, expands our product development capabilities, increases our speed to market and enables us to proactively engage customers in creating and developing new products. Our innovation platform supports our leadership position in non-GMO and organic food and strengthens our relationships with our retail, foodservice and contract manufacturing customers.

Business Development 

Definitive Agreement for Sale of Opta Minerals 

On February 12, 2016, Opta Minerals Inc. (&#147;Opta Minerals&#148;) entered into a definitive acquisition agreement, pursuant to which an affiliate of Speyside Equity Fund I LP, agreed to acquire substantially all the shares of Opta Minerals. We own approximately 66% of Opta Minerals, a company that produces, distributes and recycles industrial minerals, silica-free abrasives and specialty sands. The acquisition agreement has been approved by Opta Minerals&#146; Boards of Directors, which has recommended that Opta Minerals&#146; shareholders approve the transaction. The acquisition agreement represents the conclusion of a strategic review process conducted by Opta Minerals and its financial advisor under the supervision of a special committee of independent directors of Opta Minerals. We entered into a support agreement pursuant to which we have irrevocably agreed to vote all of our Opta Minerals&#146; shares in favor of the transaction. We expect to receive aggregate proceeds of approximately $4.5 million (C$6.2 million), of which approximately $3.0 million (C$4.2 million) is cash, with the remainder in the form of a subordinated promissory note bearing interest at 2.0% that will mature 30 months following the close of the transaction. Subject to receipt of all necessary shareholder approvals and other customary conditions, closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur in April 2016. The sale of our equity interest in Opta Minerals is consistent with our objective of divesting our non-core assets in order to become a pure-play healthy and organic foods company. In addition, the sale of Opta Minerals allows our entire management team to focus solely on the growth and strategic priorities of our healthy and organic foods business. 

Five-Year Global Revolving Asset-Based Credit Facility 

On February 11, 2016, we entered into a five-year credit agreement for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in the maximum aggregate principal amount of $350 million, subject to borrowing base capacity. The Global Credit Facility replaced our previous North American credit facilities, which were comprised of a $165 million facility and a C$10 million facility, that were set to expire January 27, 2017, and our &#8364;92.5 million multipurpose European credit facilities that were due on demand with no set maturity date. The Global Credit Facility will be used to support the working capital and general corporate needs of our global operations, in addition to funding future strategic initiatives. In addition, subject to meeting certain conditions, we may request to increase the total lending commitments under the Global Credit Facility to a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $450 million. 

Sunrise Holdings (Delaware), Inc. 

On October 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Sunrise, pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the &#147;PSA&#148;) dated July 30, 2015 (the &#147;Sunrise Acquisition&#148;), for total consideration of $472.7 million in cash. We financed the Sunrise Acquisition through a combination of: (i) net proceeds of approximately $95.5 million from a registered offering of 16.7 million of our common shares that closed on September 30, 2015; (ii) net borrowings of approximately $318.0 million under a second lien loan agreement (the &#147;Loan Agreement&#148;); and (iii) borrowings of approximately $59.2 million under our existing credit facilities.

Sunrise is the leading processor of conventional and organic IQF fruit in the U.S., and it offers a full variety of frozen fruit products and packaging formats to retail private label and foodservice customers. Sunrise&#146;s global sourcing network provides consistent year-round access to fruit, and we believe its highly scalable, strategically located operational footprint provides a low-cost operating position that will be accretive to our global platform. Sunrise is headquartered in California with approximately 300 full-time and over 2,000 seasonal employees and distributes its products from five manufacturing facilities located in California, Kansas and Mexico.

SUNOPTA INC. 7 January 2, 2016 10-K We believe of the Sunrise Acquisition is transformative for our Company as it provides us with a leading market position in conventional non-GMO and organic private label IQF fruit in the U.S. We expect the Sunrise Acquisition to enhance our product mix, strengthen our revenue growth and margin profile, provide multiple synergy opportunities and leverage our strategic focus on integrated consumer food products. Key highlights of Sunrise include:

&#160; &#149; Leading processor of private label IQF fruit in the U.S. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Market leading position in high growth private label frozen fruit category &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Strong financial profile, including robust margins and an attractive sales growth trajectory &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Multi-year relationships with top retail and foodservice customers &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Automated, strategically located processing facilities that help maintain a low-cost position &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Loyal and long-term grower relationships &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Diversified supply chain through strategic international sourcing initiatives &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Experienced management team In January 2016, we initiated the consolidation of our frozen fruit processing facilities following the Sunrise Acquisition. In particular, we are in the process of closing our Buena Park, California facility and transferring this volume into Sunrise&#8217;s facilities located in Kansas and California. This consolidation is expected to be completed by the end of first quarter of 2016 and to provide a large part of our targeted cost synergies savings for 2016. 

Niagara Natural Fruit Snack Company Inc. 

On August 11, 2015, we acquired the net operating assets of Niagara Natural Fruit Snack Company Inc. (&#147;Niagara Natural&#148;), a manufacturer of all-natural fruit snacks. Niagara Natural&#146;s operations are located in the Niagara Region of Ontario. We believe Niagara Natural is a strong strategic fit within our core consumer products strategy, aligning well with our focus on healthy and convenient snacking, as well as within our vertically integrated business model since the majority of ingredients can be sourced through our Global Ingredients segment. In addition, with this acquisition, we extend our market presence in fruit snacks with manufacturing operations in both the East and West Regions of North America, which is expected to generate operational and logistical synergies. The transaction included a cash purchase price of $6.5 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments, plus potential future payments of up to approximately $2.8 million based on specific performance targets.

Selet Hulling PLC 

On May 2, 2015, we paid $0.7 million in cash to increase our ownership position in Selet Hulling PLC (&#147;Selet&#148;) from 35% to 76%. Selet is a joint venture located in Ethiopia focused on the sourcing and supply of organic sesame. As a result of our increased ownership in Selet, we obtained full management control of the operation. Through our investment in Selet, we intend to continue the development of a key source of organic sesame and other organic raw materials from Ethiopia and the East-African Region. 

Citrusource, LLC 

On March 2, 2015, we acquired Citrusource, LLC (&#147;Citrusource&#148;), a producer of premium not-from-concentrate private label organic and conventional orange juice and citrus products in the U.S. We paid $13.3 million in cash at closing and we may pay additional consideration valued at $33.8 million as at the acquisition date, based on the incremental growth in Citrusource&#146;s base business and the value of synergies created from combining the operations of Citrusource with our premium juice facility located in San Bernardino, California.

Other Developments 

Succession of Chief Executive Officer 

On July 7, 2015, we announced the appointment of Hendrik Jacobs, our former President and Chief Operating Officer, to President and Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;), effective October 1, 2015. In conjunction with this appointment, Mr. Jacobs also became a member of our board of directors effective October 1, 2015. Mr. Jacobs succeeded former CEO, Steve Bromley, who served as Vice-Chair of the board of directors from October 1, 2015 until his resignation from SunOpta on December 31, 2015. 

SUNOPTA INC. 8 January 2, 2016 10-K Corporate Social Responsibility Report 

On June 29, 2015, we released our 2014 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which provides an update on progress towards our sustainability goals covering social, environmental and economic objectives, and further reinforces our commitment to becoming an increasingly sustainable organization. This report covers the operations of SunOpta, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture operations, and is available on our website.

SUNOPTA INC. 9 January 2, 2016 10-K SEGMENT INFORMATION 

In connection with the definitive agreement for the sale of Opta Minerals, we recognized Opta Minerals as a discontinued operation held for sale as at January 2, 2016. Accordingly, the results of operations of Opta Minerals for the current and prior fiscal periods have been reported in discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior to being recognized as a discontinued operation, Opta Minerals was reported as a standalone operating segment within SunOpta. With the recognition of Opta Minerals as a discontinued operation, the composition of our remaining reportable segments is as follows:

&#160; &#149; Global Ingredients aggregates our North American-based Raw Material Sourcing and Supply and European-based International Sourcing and Supply operating segments focused on the procurement and sale of specialty and organic grains and seeds, raw material ingredients, value-added grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and organic commodities. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Consumer Products consists of three main commercial platforms: Healthy Beverages, Healthy Fruit and Healthy Snacks. Healthy Beverages include aseptic packaged products including non-dairy and dairy beverages, broths and teas; refrigerated premium juices; and shelf-stable juices and functional waters. Healthy Fruit includes IQF fruits for retail; IQF and bulk frozen fruit for foodservice; and fruit ingredients. Healthy Snacks includes fruit snacks; nutritional and protein bars; and re-sealable pouch products. 

In addition, Corporate Services provides a variety of management, financial, legal, information technology, treasury and administration services to each of our operating segments from our headquarters in Mississauga, Ontario and our administrative office Edina, Minnesota. 

Financial information for each reportable segment describing revenues from external customers, a measure of profit or loss, and total assets for the last three fiscal years, as well as financial information about geographic areas for the last three fiscal years, is presented in note 21 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Global Ingredients 

Operations and Product offerings&#151;Global Ingredients 

Global Ingredients aggregates our North American and international raw material sourcing and supply operating segments focused on the procurement, processing and sale of specialty and organic grains, seeds, fruits, grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and other commodities, which are used primarily in applications serving the natural and organic food industry. Its operations are centered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Edina, Minnesota, and Scotts Valley, California. 

Global Ingredients sources products from approximately 65 countries around the world, which include: 

&#149; Organic fruit- and vegetable-based raw materials and ingredients, sweeteners, cocoa, coffees, ancient grains, nuts, seeds and pulses and other organic food products. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Identity preserved (&#147;IP&#148;), non-GMO and organic seeds and grains including soy, corn and sunflower for food applications, with control maintained at every stage of production, from seed selection and growing through storage, processing and transportation. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Seed- and grain-based animal feed and pet food products that originate from select organic and non-GMO soy, corn, sunflower and other commodities. 

Global Ingredients also engages in processing and contract manufacturing services that include: 

&#160; &#149; Seed and grain conditioning services for soy, corn and sunflower. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Grain milling for corn, with various granulations and batch sizing. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; Coffee and sesame seed processing. SUNOPTA INC. 10 January 2, 2016 10-K &#160; &#149; Dry and oil roasting and packaging, including in-shell sunflower and sunflower kernels, corn, soy- and legume- based snacks. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Liquid (concentrates and oil) and dried format seed, grain and cocoa based ingredients utilizing non-GMO and organic soy, corn, sunflower, rice, and cocoa. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Specialty organic functional ingredients, including maltodextrins, tack blends, flavor enhancing products, including snack coatings, cheese powders and flavor systems. 

Competition&#151;Global Ingredients 

Food ingredients are considered unique niche items often sourced, developed or processed for specific customers or industry segments. Global Ingredients competes with large seed, grain, raw material and specialty ingredient suppliers for customers and competes with other companies active on the international commercial seed, grain and raw material procurement market for supply. Its non-GMO and organic specialty products compete in the smaller niche commercial non-GMO and organic seed, grain and raw material markets. Key to competing in these markets is access to transportation, supply and relationships with producers. Competitors include major food companies with food ingredient divisions, other food ingredient and sourcing companies, and consumer food companies that also engage in the development and sale of food ingredients. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources, as well as production and marketing capabilities that are greater than our own. 

The international organic food industry is very competitive due primarily to the limited worldwide supply of organic raw materials. Global Ingredients competes with worldwide brokers, traders and food processors for the limited supply of organic raw material ingredients. In many cases, it will enter into exclusive arrangements with growers and/or processors of key strategic commodities to control the reliability of its supply chain. 

Distribution, Marketing, and Sales&#151;Global Ingredients 

As a leading provider of IP, non-GMO and organic, grains, seeds, grain- and cocoa-based ingredients, and other raw materials, Global Ingredients has well established sales and marketing capabilities, including technically oriented sales teams strategically located close to specific geographic sourcing and/or sales regions. Its specialty grains, seeds and other raw materials and ingredients are sold to food manufacturers and producers worldwide, including some of the largest U.S. consumer-packaged food companies. In addition, in our estimation, it maintains one of the largest organic raw material ingredient sourcing and supply networks in the world, working closely to develop and manage global organic supply and link these supplies with diverse customer needs. It also provides procurement and ingredient processing support to the Consumer Products operating segment. 

Suppliers&#151;Global Ingredients 

Global Ingredients has an extensive established IP, organic soy, corn and sunflower grower network in North America, with many relationships existing for over 25 years. It also has a network of growers in Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. Because weather conditions and other factors can limit the availability of raw materials in a specific geography, it continues to focus on expanding production and sourcing capabilities to other parts of the world to ensure supply in years when local production is below normal levels. By diversifying supply, it also has the ability to divert available product based on market demand and customer requirements in order to maximize return.

Organic raw material ingredient suppliers include growers, processors and traders of organic fruit- and vegetable-based ingredients, sweeteners and other food products. The diversity of our supplier base helps to ensure continual supply by providing contra-seasonal solutions to mitigate crop and quality risks. Organic food suppliers are required to meet stringent organic certification requirements equivalent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#147;USDA&#148;) National Organic Program, European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) standards, or others. 

SUNOPTA INC. 11 January 2, 2016 10-K Consumer Products 

Operations and Product Offerings&#151;Consumer Products 

Consumer Products provides healthy and organic food products that are primarily consumer-packaged to retailers, foodservice distributors and major global food manufacturers with a variety of branded and private label products. Consumer Products&#146; packaged food products are categorized into the following three main commercial platforms: 

&#160; &#149; Healthy Beverages &#160; &#149; Aseptic beverages including soy, almond, rice, coconut, sunflower and other non-dairy and alternative beverages, as well as adjacent categories such as organic dairy and nutritional beverages, including milk, broths and teas. Specializing in aseptic product offerings, Consumer Products produces a variety of pack sizes, including multi-serve and single-serve formats, all shelf stable with long shelf lives. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Organic and conventional beverage products, including shelf stable and refrigerated juices; specialty beverages; vitamin and electrolyte waters; and energy drinks. Consumer Products partners with third-party fillers to provide extended shelf life refrigerated packaging formats to its customers. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Our Healthy Beverage platform operates from an east to west network of four facilities, as well as co- manufacturing relationships that allow us to minimize distribution costs for our customers, maintain redundant back-up plans, and offer reliable, year-round programs. 

&#160; &#149; Healthy Fruit &#149; IQF natural and organic frozen fruits and vegetables, including strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, peppers, broccoli, blends and many other items. Consumer Products produces a variety of packaging formats, including tubs, stand-up pouches, cups and polybags to address the needs of its retail and foodservice customers. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Specialty fruit toppings and bases, which are custom formulated to provide unique flavor and texture profiles for a wide range of specialized applications. Applications include fruit bases for yogurts, ice creams, cheeses, smoothies, shakes, frozen desserts, bakery fillings, health bars, various beverages, dressings, marinades, dips and sauces, and fruit toppings for foodservice applications. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Our healthy Fruit platform operates from six facilities that extend from the central Mexico through to California, as well as a production facility in Kansas. Strategically our north to south footprint on the west coast allows us to maximize access to supply of fruit over the course of the full growing season, while our operation in the Midwest serves as a lower-cost launching pad to deliver product to the east coast. 

&#160; &#149; Healthy Snacks &#149; Organic and conventional re-sealable pouch products, in a variety of pack sizes and shapes, containing a variety of products including baby food, puddings, sauces, and healthy fruit-, vegetable- and protein-based snacks serving the adult nutrition category. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Nutritious snacks including natural and organic fruit-based snacks in bar, twist, rope and bite size shapes, with the ability to add a variety of ingredients; and baked and extruded nutrition (i.e., protein, energy and meal replacement) bars using a wide variety of ingredients including grains, proteins and other ingredients. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Our Healthy Snack platform operates from an east to west network of four facilities, as well as co- manufacturing relationships. In the case of fruit snacks and resealable pouches we maintain bi-coastal production which helps to minimize delivery costs to our customers. 

SUNOPTA INC. 12 January 2, 2016 10-K Competition&#151;Consumer Products 

Consumer Products&#146; healthy beverage and health snacks offerings compete with major food manufacturing companies, as well as a number of other regional manufacturers. Its healthy fruit offerings face competition from both branded and private label fruit providers. It faces competition when securing seed, grain, fruit, vegetable and dairy raw materials; however, due to the location of its processing facilities, it is able to source these raw materials from a number of growing regions and suppliers. Integrated sourcing through Global Ingredients, which supplies a number of core raw materials, combined with in-house processing and packaging capabilities, provides Consumer Products with a low-cost advantage over many of its competitors. 

Distribution, Marketing and Sales&#151;Consumer Products 

Consumer Products supplies the private-label retail market, including large retailers and club stores, branded food companies, food manufacturers, foodservice distributors, quick service and casual dining restaurants located principally in North America. In addition, it markets branded food products under SunOpta-controlled brands, including Sunrich &#174; Naturals, Pure Nature&#153; and Nature&#146;s Finest&#153;. Consumer Products generally conducts its business with customers on the basis of purchase orders and price quotations, without other formal agreements related to minimum or maximum supplies or pricing. 

Costco Wholesale (&#147;Costco&#148;) accounted for approximately 13% of revenues from our Consumer Products segment for the year ended January 2, 2016. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues from our Consumer Products segment for the year ended January 2, 2016. After giving effect to the Sunrise Acquisition, on a pro forma basis, Costco would have accounted for approximately 17% of revenues from our Consumer Products segment, and approximately 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended January 2, 2016. 

Suppliers&#151;Consumer Products 

Consumer Products&#146; raw materials are subject to the availability of seed, grain, fruit, vegetable and dairy supply, which is based on conditions that are beyond our control. Seeds and grains are sourced through Global Ingredients&#146; established grower network. Fresh and frozen fruits, berries, and vegetables are sourced directly from a large number of suppliers throughout the U.S., Mexico and globally, or through Global Ingredients. We believe our scale and location close to growing areas makes Consumer Products&#146; an attractive customer for fruit growers. Organic dairy ingredients are sourced from independent distributors.

Consumer Products also relies on its packaging suppliers to ensure delivery of often unique, portable, and convenient consumer packaging formats. In our aseptic packaging facilities we specialize in the use of Tetra Pak equipment in a variety of pack sizes and also offer a variety of opening types and extended shelf life (&#147;ESL&#148;) options. Consumer Products also partners with third party fillers to provide ESL and refrigerated packaging formats to its customers.

REGULATION 

We are subject to a wide range of governmental regulations and policies in various countries and regions where we operate, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, throughout the rest of the EU, China and Ethiopia. These laws, regulations and policies are implemented, as applicable in each jurisdiction, on the national, federal, state, provincial and local levels. For example, we are affected by laws and regulations related to: seed, fertilizer and pesticides; the purchasing, harvesting, transportation and warehousing of grain and other products; the processing, packaging and sale of food, including wholesale operations; and product labeling and marketing, food safety and food defense. We are also affected by government-sponsored price supports, acreage set aside programs and a number of environmental regulations.

SUNOPTA INC. 13 January 2, 2016 10-K U.S. Regulations 

We are required to comply with the regulations and policies promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) and corresponding state agencies, as well as the USDA, the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard Administration, the Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;), the Federal Trade Commission (&#147;FTC&#148;), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#147;OSHA&#148;) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission. 

USDA National Organic Program and Similar Regulations 

We are involved in the sourcing, manufacturing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic seed and food products and, as such, are subject to certain organic quality assurance standards. In 1990, Congress passed the Organic Foods Production Act mandating that the USDA develop national standards for organically produced agricultural products to assure consumers that those products marketed as organic meet consistent, uniform standards. The Organic Foods Production Act established the National Organic Program, a marketing program housed within the Agricultural Marketing Service of the USDA. 

In December 2000, after considering recommendations from the National Organic Standards Board, as well as private, state, and foreign organic certification programs, USDA adopted regulations with respect to a national organic production, handling, labeling and certification program contained within 7 CFR 205. The regulations became fully effective in October 2002. These regulations, among other things, set forth the minimum standards producers must meet, and have reviewed by an accredited USDA-certifying agent, in order to label their products &#147;100% organic&#148;, &#147;organic&#148;, or &#147;made with organic ingredients&#148; and display the USDA organic seal. The regulations impose strict standards on the production of organic food products and limit the use of non-organic or synthetic materials in the production of organic foods. Generally, organic food products are produced using: 

&#160; &#149; agricultural management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem health; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; no genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides or fungicides; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; food processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms or synthetic preservatives. After becoming certified, organic operations must retain records concerning the production, harvesting, and handling of agricultural products that are to be sold as organic for a period of five years. Any organic operation found to be in violation of the USDA organic regulations is subject to enforcement actions, which can include financial penalties or suspension or revocation of their organic certificate.

Additionally, our organic products may be subject to various state regulations. Many states have adopted their own organic programs making the state agency responsible for enforcing USDA regulations for organic operations. However, state organic programs may also add more restrictive requirements due to specific environmental conditions or the necessity of production and handling practices in the state. Applicable regulatory agencies in the U.S. include the USDA, which monitors and ensures the integrity of both the organic process and agricultural grain business, and the FDA and Department of Homeland Security (&#147;DHS&#148;), which oversee the safety, security and efficacy of the food supply in the U.S. 

We currently manufacture and distribute a number of organic products that are subject to the standards set forth in the Organic Foods Production Act and the regulations adopted thereunder by the National Organic Standards Board. We believe that we are in material compliance with the organic regulations applicable to our business.

Food-Related Regulations 

As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are also subject to a number of federal, state and local food-related regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (the &#147;FDCA&#148;) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the U.S. The FDA: 

&#160; &#149; regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#149; specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell; and SUNOPTA INC. 14 January 2, 2016 10-K &#160; &#149; prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels. Some of the key food safety and food labeling regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160; 1. Food Safety Regulations 

The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (&#147;FSMA&#148;), signed into law on January 4, 2011, enables FDA to better protect public health by strengthening the food safety system. The goal of FSMA is to shift the focus of the current food safety scheme away from one that is reactive to one that is preventative. The law provides FDA with new enforcement authorities and tools designed to achieve higher rates of compliance with prevention- and risk-based food safety standards and to better respond to and contain problems when they do occur. Since 2011, FDA has been in the process of implementing FSMA through regulations.

In the last year, FDA has finalized several rules in connections with FSMA including: (1) Accredited Third-Party Certification, (2) Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption, (3) Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals, (4) Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food, and (5) Current Good Manufacturing Practice and Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals. The final rules on good manufacturing practices and preventive controls relating to food for human consumption apply to us as we manufacture, process, pack and hold food for human consumption. We will be required to comply with this rule starting in September 2016, one year after publication of the final rule. The final rule contains certain key requirements: 

&#160; a. Food Safety Plan 

Covered facilities must establish and implement a written food safety system that includes an analysis of hazards and risk-based preventive controls. The hazard analysis must consider known or reasonably foreseeable biological, chemical, and physical hazards. The preventive control measures are required to ensure that hazards requiring a preventive control will be minimized or prevented. They include process, food allergen, and sanitation controls, as well as supply-chain controls and a recall plan. In addition to establishing preventive controls, we must continuously ensure that the controls are effective through monitoring and verification activities. If a control fails, prompt corrective actions must be taken to identify a problem with preventive control implementation, to reduce the likelihood the problem will recur, evaluate affected food for safety, and prevent it from entering commerce. All corrective actions must be documented in writing. 

&#160; b. Supply Chain Management 

The final rule mandates that a manufacturing facility have a risk-based supply chain program for those raw materials and other ingredients that have an identified hazard requiring a supply-chain applied control. Accordingly, we are responsible for ensuring that foods are received only from approved suppliers, or on a temporary basis from unapproved suppliers whose materials are subject to verification activities before being accepted for use.

&#160; c. Current Good Manufacturing Practices 

The final rule updated and clarified current good manufacturing practices. Specifically, some of the previously nonbinding regulatory provisions, such as education and training, are now binding. Management is required to ensure that all employees who manufacture, process, pack or hold food are qualified and properly educated to perform their assigned duties. 

Now that this rule has become final, we are in the process of developing regulatory compliance programs to ensure that all requirements of the rules applicable to us are met by the effective date.

In addition, we are subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (the &#147;Bioterrorism Act&#148;) and regulations issued thereunder. The Bioterrorism Act authorizes the FDA to take the regulatory action necessary to protect the nation&#146;s food supply against the threat of intentional or accidental contamination. The major components of the Bioterrorism Act include registration of food facilities with the FDA; prior notice of virtually all imported food shipments under FDA authority; recordkeeping requirements for food facilities; FDA authority to administratively detain food; FDA authority to institute debarment of food importers for various violations related to food importation; and creation of a clear way to re-import previously refused foods if certain criteria are met. 

SUNOPTA INC. 15 January 2, 2016 10-K Lastly, we are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products. 

&#160; 2. Food Labeling Regulations 

The Company is subject to certain requirements relating to food labeling under the FDCA and corresponding FDA regulations as well as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act enacted in 1967 and corresponding FTC regulations. Although the FTC, FDA, and USDA share jurisdiction over claims made by manufacturers of food products, the FDA retains primary jurisdiction over the labeling of food products whereas the FTC regulates advertising.

The FDA and FTC require that all food products be labeled to disclose the net contents, the identity of commodity, nutrition information, and the name and place of business of the product&#146;s manufacturer, packer, or distributor in order to prevent consumer deception. Both agencies also require that any claim on the product be truthful and not misleading.

Other state and local statutes and regulations may impose additional food labeling requirements. For instance, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (commonly referred to as &#147;Proposition 65&#148;) requires, with a few exceptions, that a specific warning appear on any consumer product sold in California that contains a substance, above certain levels, listed by that state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. This law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products. 

FDA Generally Regarded as Safe Regulations 

Food ingredients can be classified into four groups including: food additives; color additives; prior sanctioned substances, and Generally Regarded as Safe (&#147;GRAS&#148;) substances. In particular, a food additive is a substance, &#147;the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, either in their becoming a component of food or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food&#148;. Food additives require premarket approval under the 1958 Food Additive Amendments to the FDCA as administered by FDA. However, in enacting those amendments, Congress recognized that many substances intentionally used in a manner whereby they are added to food would not require a formal premarket review by FDA to assure their safety, either because their safety had been established by a long history of use in food or by virtue of the nature of the substances, their customary or projected conditions of use, and the information generally available to scientists about the substances. Congress thus excluded from the definition of &#147;food additive&#148; substances that are generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures to be safe under the conditions of their intended use, or GRAS. 

Companies may establish GRAS status through &#147;self-affirmation&#148; whereby the producer determines on its own that the ingredient is GRAS, normally with the assistance of a panel of qualified experts. The producer may also voluntarily submit a &#147;GRAS Notification&#148; to the FDA that includes the products description, conditions of use, and the basis for GRAS determination, among other information. The FDA response to a GRAS notice, typically issued within 180 days, is not an approval and the product may be marketed while the FDA is reviewing the information.

A food ingredient is eligible for GRAS classification based on the &#147;views of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety&#148; of the product. The expert&#146;s views are either based on scientific procedures or through experience based on common use of the material prior to 1958. If based on scientific procedures they must use the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as would be required for the FDA to issue a premarket approval of the sale of a food additive. If a food ingredient is not entitled to GRAS status, premarket approval must be sought through the filing of a Food Additive Petition. 

A number of our products are being marketed pursuant to GRAS self-affirmation. We believe that a majority of products for which we have commercial rights are GRAS. However, such status cannot be determined until actual formulations and uses are finalized. Thereafter, we decide whether self-affirmation procedures and a GRAS notification will be appropriate. For those components that do not qualify for GRAS, we may be required to file a Food Additive Petition. In the event that a petition is required, we may elect to sell or license our rights to manufacture, market, and distribute the component to another party. 

SUNOPTA INC. 16 January 2, 2016 10-K Environmental Regulations 

The Company is also subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental regulations. Some of the key environmental regulations in the U.S. include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160; &#149; Air quality regulations &#150; air quality is regulated by the EPA and certain city/state air pollution control groups. Emission reports are filed annually. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Waste treatment/disposal regulations &#150; solid waste is either disposed of by a third-party or, in some cases, we have a permit to haul and apply the sludge to land. Agreements exist with local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified levels of Biological Oxygen Demand (&#147;BOD&#148;), Total Suspended Solids (&#147;TSS&#148;) and other constituents. This can require weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Sewer regulations &#150; we have agreements with the local city sewer districts to treat waste at specified limits of BOD and TSS. This requires weekly/monthly reporting as well as annual inspection. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Hazardous chemicals regulations &#150; Various reports are filed with local city/state emergency response agencies to identify potential hazardous chemicals being used in our facilities. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Storm water &#150; all facilities are inspected annually and must comply with an approved storm water plan to protect water supplies. 

Employee Safety Regulations 

We are subject to certain safety regulations, including OSHA regulations. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. We believe that we are in material compliance with all employee safety regulations applicable to our business. 

Canadian and Other Non-U.S. Regulations 

Outside of the U.S., regulations concerning the sale or characterization of food ingredients vary substantially from country to country, and we take appropriate steps to comply with such regulations.

In Canada, the sale of food is regulated under various federal and provincial laws, principally the federal Food and Drugs Act (&#147;FADA&#148;), Canada Agricultural Products Act (&#147;CAPA&#148;), and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (&#147;CEPA&#148;), along with their supporting regulations. Some of the key Canadian regulatory instruments include but are not limited to the following: 

&#149; Food and Drug Regulations (under the FADA) &#150; food and drugs are subject to specific regulatory requirements, including composition (such as food additives, fortification, and food standards), packaging, labeling, advertising and marketing, and licensing requirements. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Organic Products Regulations, 2009 (&#147;OPR&#148;) (under the CAPA) &#150; the OPR require mandatory certification to the revised national organic standard for agricultural products that are to be represented as organic in international and inter- provincial trade, or that bear the federal organic agricultural product legend (or federal logo). Except for certain exceptions and conditions, a U.S.-Canada Organic Equivalence Arrangement is currently in place whereby agricultural products produced and processed in conformity with the U.S. Organic Foods Production Act and the Canadian OPR are deemed to have been produced and processed in accordance with the OPR and may be sold, labelled or represented in Canada as organic. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (&#147;CCPSA&#148;) &#150; the CCPSA provides oversight and regulation of consumer products with respect to manufacturers, importers, and retailers. It includes, without limitation, the ability to require product recalls, mandatory incident reporting, document retention requirements, increased fines and penalties, and packaging and labeling requirements. While the CCPSA does not apply to food, it does apply to its packaging with respect to safety. It is possible that there will be amendments introduced to the FADA, to capture the essence of the regulatory oversight found in the CCPSA. We have no way of anticipating if and when that may occur. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act (&#147;CPLA&#148;) &#150; the CPLA and its supporting regulations outline requirements for packaging and labeling of products, including food products. The CPLA sets out labeling requirements relating to the description of the product, net quantity and dealer information, as well as packaging standards. The CPLA also includes a prohibition against false or misleading labeling. 

SUNOPTA INC. 17 January 2, 2016 10-K &#149; Canada Food Inspection Agency Act (&#147;CFIAA&#148;) &#150; the CFIAA grants power to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the &#147;CFIA&#148;), which is tasked with the administration and enforcement of certain Canadian food legislation. Under the CFIAA, the CFIAA has the power to recall certain products if the Minister believes that such product poses a risk to the public, animal or plant health. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#149; Processed Products Regulations (&#147;PPR&#148;) (under the CAPA) &#150; the PPR regulates the grading, packing and marking of processed products that are produced in Canada for inter-provincial or export trade or imported into Canada. Under the PPR, processed food products are those that are prepared to assure preservation of the food product in transport, distribution and storage. The PPR establishes requirements with respect to the content, preparation, packing and marking of processed food products. 

We are subject to Dutch and European Commission (&#147;EC&#148;) regulations and policies. Our European subsidiary, The Organic Corporation (&#147;TOC&#148;), is involved in the sourcing, supplying, processing, marketing, selling and distribution of organic food products and, as such, is subject to standards for production, labeling and inspection of organic products contained in EC Regulation 2092/91 (and its subsequent amendments). TOC is certified by Skal, the inspection body for the production of organic products in the Netherlands. Products certified as organic by an EU-recognized inspection body, such as Skal, can be marketed within the entire EU. In addition, under the terms of an equivalency arrangement between the U.S. and the EU, organic operations certified to the USDA organic or EU organic standards may be labeled and sold as organic in both the U.S. and EU. 

TOC is also affected by general food legislation both at EU and Dutch level relating to product safety and hygiene, among others. TOC is Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point certified in the Netherlands and manages a fully computerized system that manages the traceability of each product. In addition, TOC also considers and abides by EU and local legislation with regard to packaging and packaging waste. TOC is also subject to the regulations and policies of the countries outside of the EU in which it operates, including China and Ethiopia. 

Following the Sunrise Acquisition, we operate a processing facility in Mexico and are subject to Mexican regulations, including regulations regarding processing, packaging and sales of food products, labor relations and profit-sharing with employees. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Research and development and new product, process and packaging innovation are key priorities of our Company and initiatives are focused on continuous improvement of our existing product portfolios and continuing efforts to improve production process to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, as well as the development of innovative new products. Innovation is a key pillar for us and a necessity in the natural and organic foods categories. We believe our commitment and proactive approach to new product development and innovation is important to our ability to introduce new higher-margin food and beverage products to the market. 

In June 2015, we expanded our research and development platform by opening an advanced innovation center in Edina, Minnesota. This facility supports our dedicated team of food scientists, engineers and technicians, expands our product development capabilities, increases our speed to market and enables us to proactively engage customers in creating and developing new products. We believe our innovation platform supports our leadership position in non-GMO and organic food and strengthens our relationships with our retail, foodservice and contract manufacturing customers.

Our product development team includes highly trained and experienced food scientists and technologists that are dedicated to both the development of unique new product offerings plus addressing product development opportunities for our customers including new and custom formulations, innovations in packaging formats, and new production processes and applications. Applications and technical support provided to our customers include all aspects of product development from concept to commercial launch, as well as ongoing manufacturing and processing support.

We continue to develop new products to maximize the capabilities of our aseptic packaging facilities, including the development of non-dairy based beverages that address the growing consumer demand for beverages that satisfy allergy concerns and provide a unique nutritional profile, as well as teas, organic dairy and nutritional beverages. In addition, we continue to develop new fruit-based beverages, fruit- and grain-based snacks, nutrition bars and fruit-based re-sealable pouch products, as well as innovative fruit ingredient systems for the dairy, foodservice and beverage industries. We are also continually looking to develop new value-added products for our customers that leverage our global sourcing platform.

SUNOPTA INC. 18 January 2, 2016 10-K INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

The nature of a number of our products and processes requires that we create and maintain patents, trade secrets and trademarks. Our policy is to protect our technology, brands and trade names by, among other things, filing patent applications for technology relating to the development of our business in the U.S. and in selected foreign jurisdictions, registering trademarks in the U.S., Canada and selected foreign jurisdictions where we sell products, and maintenance of confidentiality agreements with outside parties and employees. 

Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our products, trade names and technology under U.S. and international patent laws and other intellectual property laws. We believe that we own or have sufficient rights to use all of the proprietary technology, information and trademarks necessary to manufacture and market our products; however, there is always a risk that patent applications relating to our products or technologies will not result in patents being issued, or, if issued, will be later challenged by a third party, or that current or additional patents will not afford protection against competitors with similar technology.

We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how and confidentiality agreements to protect certain technologies and processes. Even with these steps taken, our outside partners and contract manufacturers could gain access to our proprietary technology and confidential information. All employees are required to adhere to internal policies which are intended to further protect our technologies, processes and trade secrets.
