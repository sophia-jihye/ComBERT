ITEM I: BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Organization and Nature of Business 

&#160; 

Our Corporate History 

&#160; 

NanoViricides, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on July 25, 2000 as Edot-com.com, Inc. and was organized for the purpose of conducting Internet retail sales. On April 1, 2005, Edot-com.com, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada for the purpose of re-domiciling the Company as a Nevada corporation, Edot-com.com (Nevada). On April 15, 2005, Edot- com.com (Colorado) and Edot-com.com (Nevada) were merged and Edot-com.com, Inc., (ECMM) a Nevada corporation, became the surviving entity. On April 15, 2005, the authorized shares of common stock was increased to 300,000,000 shares at $.001 par value and the Company effected a 3.2 to 1 forward stock split effective May 12, 2005. 

&#160; 

On June 1, 2005, Edot-com.com, Inc. acquired NanoViricide, Inc., a privately owned Florida corporation (&#8220;NVI&#8221;), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Share Exchange (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;). NVI was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on May 12, 2005 and its sole asset was comprised of a licensing agreement with TheraCour Pharma, Inc., (&#8220;TheraCour,&#8221; an approximately 16.5% shareholder of NVI) for rights to develop and commercialize novel and specifically targeted drugs based on TheraCour&#8217;s targeting technologies, against a number of human viral diseases. (For financial accounting purposes, the acquisition was a reverse acquisition of the Company by NVI, under the purchase method of accounting, and was treated as a recapitalization with NVI as the acquirer). Upon consummation of the Exchange, ECMM adopted the business plan of NVI. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange, ECMM acquired NVI in exchange for an aggregate of 80,000,000 newly issued shares of ECMM common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 100,000,000 shares of ECMM common stock issued and outstanding. As a result of the Exchange, NVI became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECMM. The ECMM shares were issued to the NVI Shareholders on a pro rata basis, on the basis of 4,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock for each share of NVI common stock held by such NVI Shareholder at the time of the Exchange. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

On June 28, 2005, NVI was merged into its parent ECMM and the separate corporate existence of NVI ceased. Effective on the same date, Edot-com.com, Inc., changed its name to NanoViricides, Inc. and its stock symbol on the Pink Sheets to &#8220;NNVC&#8221;, respectively. The Company submitted a Form-10SB to the SEC to become a reporting company on November 14, 2006. The Company&#8217;s filing status became effective in March, 2007. On June 28, 2007, the company became quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol NNVC. The Company is considered a development stage company at this time. 

&#160; 

On September 10, 2013, the Company adopted a uniform reverse split of its securities in a 3.5 to 1 ratio, reducing its authorized common stock to 85,714,287 shares at $0.001 par value, in order to satisfy the share price listing requirements of US National exchanges. On Wednesday, September 25, 2013, the Company&#8217;s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange MKT (NYSE MKT) under the same symbol, namely &#8220;NNVC&#8221;. 

&#160; 

NanoViricides, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is a nano-biopharmaceutical (nanomedicine) company whose business goals are to discover, develop and commercialize therapeutics to advance the care of patients suffering from life-threatening viral infections. We are a development stage company with several drugs in various stages of early development. The Company&#8217;s drugs are based on several patents, patent applications, provisional patent applications, and other proprietary intellectual property held by TheraCour Pharma, Inc. (&#8220;TheraCour&#174;&#8221;), to which the Company has exclusive licenses in perpetuity for the treatment of the following human viral diseases: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS), Influenza including Asian Bird Flu Virus (INF), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Rabies. On February 15, 2010, the Company entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types for Dengue viruses (DENV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), West Nile Virus (WNV), viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses. 

&#160; 

The Company focuses its research and clinical programs on specific anti-viral therapeutics and is seeking to add to its existing portfolio of products through its internal discovery and clinical development programs and through an in-licensing strategy. To date, the Company has not commercialized any product. 

&#160; 

The Company does not claim to be creating a cure for viral diseases. The Company&#8217;s objectives are to create the best possible anti-viral nanoviricides and then subject these compounds to rigorous laboratory and animal testing towards US FDA and international regulatory approvals. Our long-term research efforts are aimed at augmenting the nanoviricides that we currently have in development with additional therapeutic agents to produce further improved anti-viral agents in the future. We believe that many viral infections that are at present untreatable or incurable would be curable using such an advanced approach. 

&#160; 

The Nanoviricide&#174; Platform Technology 

&#160; 

NanoViricides, Inc. is a global leading company in the application of nanomedicine technologies to the complex issues of viral diseases. The nanoviricide&#174; technology enables direct attacks at multiple points on a virus particle. It is believed that such attacks would lead to the virus particle becoming ineffective at infecting cells. Antibodies in contrast attack a virus particle at only a maximum of two attachment points per antibody. In addition, the nanoviricide technology also simultaneously enables attacking the rapid intracellular reproduction of the virus by incorporating one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) within the core of the nanoviricide. The nanoviricide technology is the only technology in the world, to the best of our knowledge, that is capable of both (a) attacking extracellular virus thereby breaking the reinfection cycle, and simultaneously (b) disrupting intracellular production of the virus, thereby enabling complete control of a virus infection. 

&#160; 

Our anti-viral therapeutics, that we call &#8220;nanoviricides&#174;&#8221; are designed to look to the virus like the native host cell surface to which it binds. Since these binding sites for a given virus do not change despite mutations and other changes in the virus, we believe that our drugs will be broad-spectrum, i.e. effective against most if not all strains, types, or subtypes, of a given virus, provided the virus-binding portion of the nanoviricide is engineered appropriately. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

This powerful platform technology has enabled us to develop several drug candidates against a large number of different viruses that could be further improved into clinical drug candidates, thus building a very broad drug pipeline that may lead to exponential growth of the Company upon the approval of our first drug candidate. 

&#160; 

It is important to realize that the flexible nanoviricides nanomedicines show substantial advantages over hard sphere nanoparticles in this antiviral drug application. Hard sphere nanomaterials such as dendritic materials (dendrimers), nanogold shells, silica, gold or titanium nanospheres, polymeric particles, etc., were never designed to be capable of completely enveloping and neutralizing the virus particle. 

&#160; 

Nanoviricides are designed to work by binding to and eliminating virus particles from the blood-stream, just as antibodies do, only potentially much better. Treating a patient that has a viral infection with a nanoviricide against that virus is expected to result in reduction in viremia. Reduction in viremia is an important goal in diseases caused by all viral infections. Nanoviricides are designed to accomplish this using a &#8220;Bind-Encapsulate-Destroy&#8221; strategy to eliminate the free virus.

&#160; 

A nanoviricide is constructed by chemically attaching a ligand designed to bind to a virus particle, to a polymeric material that forms a flexible nanomicelle by self-assembly. If antibodies are known to affect a viral disease, it is possible to construct a nanoviricide against it, and there can be a general expectation of some success, depending upon the ligand chosen. We can choose a ligand from any of a number of chemical classes, including small chemicals, peptides, or antibody fragments or even whole antibodies. 

&#160; 

A nanoviricide is made by chemically covalently linking a &#8220;nanomicelle&#8221; - a globular polymeric micelle with pendant lipid chains inside, to one or more different small chemical ligands designed to mimic the cellular receptor to which the virus binds. In addition, the nanoviricide can carry additional active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which may be chosen to affect the intracellular virus life cycle. Thus the nanoviricide platforms enables construction of complete virus-killing nanomachines that block the virus from entering the cell as well as that block further production of the virus inside the cell. 

&#160; 

Attacking the &#8220;Achilles Heel&#8221; of the Virus- Unchanging Ability of the Virus to Bind to Its Cognate Receptor on Cell 

&#160; 

We strive hard to develop virus-binding small chemical ligands that mimic the cognate cellular receptor of the virus, using rational design and molecular modeling strategies and our internal, accumulated expertise. This is the receptor to which a virus binds to gain entry into the human cell. Some viruses use more than one, different, receptors. The nanoviricide&#174; platform technology allows use of different ligands on the same nanoviricide drug to be able to attack such difficult viruses. 

&#160; 

It would be very difficult for a virus to become resistant to a nanoviricide that mimics the virus&#8217; cellular receptor. This is because, no matter how much a virus mutates or changes, its binding to the cellular receptor does not change. If the virus does not bind to the nanoviricide efficiently, it would likely have lost its ability to bind to the cellular receptor efficiently as well, resulting in an attenuated version with limited pathogenicity. 

&#160; 

Beyond Antibodies: A Nanoviricide in Its Design is a Nanomachine Built to Destroy Viruses 

A nanoviricide exposes a very high density of virus binding sites on its surface, in contrast to a human cell. Thus, a virus would be more likely to be captured by the nanoviricide than to bind to a cell. Once bound to the virus, it is thought that the nanoviricide would wrap itself around the virus, and the interior lipidic chains of the nanoviricide would merge into the lipid envelope of an enveloped virus, thus destabilizing the virus. This would result in loss of the viral glycoproteins that it uses to bind to cell and to fuse with the cell membrane, thus rendering the virus particle non-infectious. In contrast, for an antibody to be successful as a drug, as many as ten to fifteen antibodies must bind to saturate the virus surface. The resulting antibody-virus complex then may be subject to the complement protein system in the bloodstream, or it may bind to antibody-receptors on human immune cells. Thus the human immune system needs to be functional for an antibody to be effective as a &#8220;drug&#8221;. In a sense, antibodies only &#8220;flag&#8221; the virus particle as foreign. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

Almost any virus that causes pathology in humans is able to do so because it has developed intelligent and complicated pathways for disabling the human immune system at one or more points. This may be one of the reasons why many antiviral antibodies fail in the field use. Additionally, viruses readily escape antibodies by mutations. Such viral escape from antibodies has been witnessed in almost every viral epidemic, be it HIV/AIDS, Influenza pandemic of 2009, or the recent Ebola epidemic of 2014-15. In contrast, a nanoviricide would complete the job of making the virus particle non-infectious, without any help from the human immune system. 

&#160; 

Broad-Spectrum Nanoviricide Drug Candidates 

A nanoviricide is generally &#8220;broad-spectrum&#8221; in the sense that it would be effective against all viruses that use the same cellular receptor. 

&#160; 

Formulation is Inherent in the Design Aspect of a Nanoviricide 

We believe that once we declare a clinical candidate for a given indication in our HerpeCide programs, further IND-enabling pre-clinical development will be rapid. Formulation development for novel drugs in normal pharmaceutical paradigm often takes years. However, in the nanoviricide approach, the nanomicelle polymeric backbone itself takes care of the formulation aspects. The nanomicelle is designed to optimize the drug for its intended route of administration, be it injectable, skin cream, eye drops, or even oral. Thus no specific formulation development is expected to be required after clinical candidate declaration. In addition, we have already short-listed the ligands as well as the nanomicelle backbones for the final candidates in the HerpeCide program. At present, as we synthesize these for the studies leading to clinical candidate declaration. At the same time, we are also continuing to develop the necessary CMC aspects of the resulting candidates in parallel. We have already performed preliminary safety studies of our injectable FluCide&#8482; drug candidate with excellent safety indications in both mouse (at KARD Scientific) and rat (at BASi) models. The HerpeCide program drug candidates are dermal or ocular topical treatments. Thus we believe that the safety/toxicology studies for these candidates will be relatively straightforward. 

&#160; 

Uniform Polymer Nature Enables Nanomedicine Manufacturing Quality Assurance 

A major problem in the field of nanomedicines has been that most nanomedicines have been found to be notoriously difficult to manufacture in a consistent manner from batch to batch. This is because of the complexity inherent in making large molecules, and the very nature of polymer and particle making processes. 

&#160; 

The nanoviricide technology has been designed from the ground up to enable consistent manufacture and control. Thus, the nanoviricide backbone is a homopolymer of a single repeating unit or monomer, and not a block copolymer. In addition, the nanoviricide polymer is designed to dynamically and naturally self-assemble into micelles in a solution. Also, the virus-binding ligands are chemically attached to the polymer. The extent of attachment can be assessed by analytical techniques that we have developed and continue to develop as needed. Further we use sterile (or almost so) techniques in the polymer processing to minimize any contamination with endotoxins or other foreign particles. The final nanoviricide solutions can be sterile filtered using membrane filtration processes. The resulting solutions can be concentrated in a non-contaminating environment in our Process Scale-Up Lab or our cGMP Facility. 

&#160; 

Thus the nanoviricides platform has been designed from the ground up to enable simplifications in processes and analyses that need to be implemented in order to develop robust, reproducible, and scalable processes. 

&#160; 

State of the Company &#8211; Drug Development Programs 

&#160; 

During the financial year ending June 30, 2016, we have continued to make significant progress in advancing our drug pipeline, and improving our resources. NanoViricides and our affiliates have further added significant strength in our staffing this year, with the total staff now at more than 30, and R&#38;D staff at well over 20 persons with expertise from chemistry, polymer chemistry, chemical engineering, chemical and biochemical analyses, virological studies, to regulatory filings. 

&#160; 

We currently have eight different drug development programs, attesting to the strength of our platform technology. We have now chosen to focus strategically on our HerpeCide&#8482; program indications and drug candidates that are expected to result in a robust franchise with drug approvals against a number of different herpesvirus indications. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

Pharmaceutical drug development is an expensive and long duration proposition. Management&#8217;s plan is to develop each of our nanoviricides to the necessary stage(s) and then engage into licensing or co-development relationships with other pharmaceutical companies. Such licensing or co-development relationships usually may entail upfront payments, milestones payments, cost-sharing, and eventual revenue-sharing, including royalty on sales. There is no guarantee that we will be able to negotiate agreements that are financially beneficial to the Company at the present stage. As and when needed, Management plans to continue to raise additional funds for our continuing drug development efforts from public markets. 

&#160; 

We believe we are now one of the very few small pharmaceutical drug innovators that possess their own cGMP or cGMP-capable manufacturing facility. With our new campus and pilot-scale c-GMP-capable manufacturing facility, we are now in a position to advance our drug candidates into clinical trials, produce the pre-clinical &#8220;tox package&#8221; batches, and the clinical drug substance batches. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s new cGMP-capable pilot-scale manufacturing facility in Connecticut may enable initial market entry for our products upon approval, allowing the Company to grow into a stand-alone Pharma company, in addition to a potential licensing strategy for success. The Company thus continues to minimize risk to investors by improving the potential for success. 

&#160; 

The HerpeCide&#8482; Program is Now Our Top Priority with At Least Four Indications to Follow 

&#160; 

We are planning at least four different indications in our HerpeCide&#8482; program, namely (i) skin cream from the treatment of shingles caused by VZV, (ii) skin cream for the treatment of orolabial herpes (&#8220;cold sores&#8221;) and recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) mostly caused by HSV-1, (iii) ocular eye drops treatment for external eye herpes keratitis (HK), caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2, and (iv) skin cream for the treatment of genital herpes caused by HSV2. Of these, the skin cream candidates against HSV-1 and VZV are the most advanced and are likely to be our earliest nanoviricide drug candidates to enter human clinical trials. 

&#160; 

The potential broad-spectrum nature of our anti-HSV drug candidates is expected to enable several antiviral indications. Thus, HSV-1 primarily affects skin and mucous membranes causing &#8220;cold sores&#8221;. HSV-2 primarily affects skin and mucous membranes leading to genital herpes. HSV-1 infection of the eye causes herpes keratitis that can lead to blindness in some cases. In addition, human herpesvirus-3 (HHV-3), aka varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox in children and when reactivated in adults, causes shingles. Shingles breakouts are amenable to topical treatment, as are the HSV cold sores, genital lesions, and herpes keratitis of the eye. Most of these indications do not have satisfactory treatments at present, if any. Further, the treatment of herpesvirus infections caused by acyclovir- and famciclovir- resistant mutants is currently an unmet medical need. 

&#160; 

Previously, in August 2015, we obtained confirmatory animal studies data on our then current lead anti-herpesvirus drug candidate at TransPharm, LLC. The data confirmed the results earlier obtained in Professor Ken Rosenthal Lab at the NorthEast Ohio Medical Center (NEOMED). In both studies, dermal topical treatment with our anti-HSV drug candidate led to 85~100% survival in mice lethally infected with the zosteriform, neurotropic, clinically-derived and relevant strain, namely HSV-1 H129. In contrast, all of the untreated mice had severe clinical morbidity and none of the untreated mice survived. These studies established this drug candidate as a viable, effective potential drug. (Professor Rosenthal has since retired from NEOMED and is now Professor of Biomedical Sciences at the College of Medicine, Roseman University of Health Sciences, Summerlin, NV.)

&#160; 

Progress In Identifying Clinical Lead Drug Candidates Against the Four HerpeCide Program Indications 

&#160; 

We have developed additional variations of the ligand used in this older herpecide drug candidate using molecular modeling and rational design strategies. The new ligands appear to have substantially improved effectiveness and similar level of safety as the prior tested ligand. We are now performing studies on chemical covalent conjugates of these ligands with different &#8220;nanomicelle&#8221; polymer backbones. We have planned a brief set of studies to identify the lead clinical candidates for the different herpesvirus indications based on these new nanoviricides. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

These nanoviricides drug candidates developed against herpes are also expected to be effective against the shingles virus, namely the Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), also called HHV-3 (human herpesvirus-3). Tests of their safety and effectiveness are under way in cell culture studies. At present, there is no well-established animal model of shingles infection, while animal models have been developed to test for shingles vaccines. There is a promising human skin explant-based model for evaluation of drugs against VZV infection that we plan to utilize in lieu of animal studies. This model is expected to be more relevant than an animal model. It is particularly suited for a topical drug such as ours. We believe that, if successful, these data will be sufficient to establish the effectiveness of a nanoviricide drug candidate to pursue further in human clinical studies. Additionally, dermal safety/toxicology studies will be needed. These studies will be relatively short in time scope if the drug is not significantly systemically distributed when given topically. Thus these safety/tox studies for the VZV skin cream are expected to be significantly shorter than the studies for ocular, injectable, or oral drugs. 

&#160; 

Topical treatment of herpesvirus infections is important because herpesviruses become latent in neuronal cells or in ganglia, and cause periodic localized breakouts that appear as skin rashes and lesions. Systemic drug treatment results in side effects because of the high systemic drug concentrations that need to be achieved and the large drug quantities that must be administered. Since the virus remains mostly localized in the area of the rash and connected nerve apparatus, using high concentrations of drugs delivered in small quantities topically would allow maximizing the effectiveness while minimizing side effects. 

&#160; 

Since these nanoviricides are designed to attack the virus directly, we believe that human clinical studies should reflect the success of the preclinical studies. 

&#160; 

We are also working on developing relevant chemical identification and characterization assays, physicochemical and biochemical characterization assays, and chemical process optimization studies, that will be part of the CMC (Chemistry, Manufacture and Controls) section of the Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for the shingles drug. We believe this drug will be our first candidate into the human clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Thus we are performing studies relevant to an Investigational New Drug (IND) application filing in the HerpeCide program at present. 

&#160; 

HerpeCide Program Collaborations 

&#160; 

We have engaged several new collaborations to help us finalize clinical candidates and develop IND-enabling pre-clinical data in our various programs this year. Notably, this year, we have signed collaborations with the CORL at the University of Wisconsin for HSV-1 and HSV-2, with focus on small animal models for ocular disease; the Campbell Lab at the University of Pittsburgh for in vitro cell culture models of various ocular viruses including many adenovirus and herpesvirus strains, as well as animal models for ocular herpes keratitis (HK) and adenoviral epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis (EKC); and Baylor College of Medicine for small animal model of ocular herpes. Of these, the Baylor program is currently on hold due to lack of personnel to advance it at the site. We are also working on developing additional collaborations to help with pre-clinical studies of nanoviricides against VZV. TransPharm, LLC, a contract research organization (CRO), continues to provide animal studies support in pre-clinical animal efficacy of our HSV-1 and HSV-2 skin cream drug candidates. In addition, we have a continuing relationship with BASi, a CRO for GLP and non-GLP safety/toxicology studies. We have engaged Biologics Consulting Group (BCG) for advice and help with regulatory affairs. 

&#160; 

Shingles and Associated Pain, Post-herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) 

&#160; 

Shingles is caused by re-activation of the chickenpox virus that most humans acquire in childhood. The chickenpox vaccine for children is a live, attenuated virus (LAV). The LAV is not as pathogenic as the wild-type virus. However, this means the virus is present in the vaccinated individual, but remains suppressed by the immune system. In both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons, re-activation occurs when the immune system is suppressed which may be simply because of stress, advanced age, or some other immune modifying circumstances include immune-compromise due to organ transplants or other diseases. Generally, humans in the age range of 50-60 are more prone to shingles, with next reactivation occurring about 10~15 years later. There is a shingles vaccine approved for adults age 60 and above, which is now also available for adults younger than that. 

&#160; 

Acyclovir-based oral drugs, such as valacyclovir (Valtrex&#174;), are available as systemic therapy for shingles. However, VZV is substantially less sensitive to (val)acyclovir than is HSV-1. Thus the oral drug generally does not result in optimal level of the active drug at the site of VZV viral production, and does not result in significant control of the pathology. Most adults with shingles recover in about 15~30 days. While the rash is unsightly, its stinging pain is often debilitating. Further, 65~70% of patients develop post-herpetic neuralgia, or PHN, a stinging, debilitating pain that lasts more than 30 days, and in some patients may last for years. At present an oral drug called FV-100 is in Phase 3 clinical trials for PHN. A Phase 2 clinical study comparing FV-100 to valacyclovir for PHN and shingles has been completed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb (BMS) in CY Q4, 2015. BMS is no longer developing this drug, although a small company is continuing to develop it. FV-100 is a nucleoside analog with an extremely restricted activity range. It is highly specific to VZV, and it did not have effectiveness against even the equivalent simian virus in pre-clinical studies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

It is generally believed that PHN results from damage to the local nerve endings and nerve cells caused by the uncontrolled production of the shingles virus. We believe that an effective therapy, such as our nanoviricide against VZV, which blocks progression of the virus to infect new cells and thereby limits further production of virus, would minimize the damage to nerve endings and nerve cells caused by the virus. We believe that this would minimize the occurrence, severity, and time period of PHN, in addition to having significant effects on the severity of shingles rash, lesions, and healing time. 

&#160; 

We believe that a skin cream would be the best form of treatment to provide rapid control of the virus and shingles lesions patch expansion, since the shingles outbreak remains highly localized. A skin cream would afford much greater local exposure of drug to virus compared to a systemic oral or injectable treatment. 

&#160; 

An effective therapy for patients with severe shingles continues to be an unmet need. 

&#160; 

HSV-1, HSV-2, Ocular Herpes Keratitis 

&#160; 

We believe that a skin cream for the control of HSV-1 &#8220;cold sores&#8221; (herpes labialis, and recurrent herpes labialis or RHL), is another drug candidate that will be close to enter human clinical trials. We have already achieved strong success in animal studies against HSV-1, as discussed above. 

&#160; 

We believe that we will be able to successfully develop a drug for Ocular Herpes Keratitis (HK) as well. It is caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection of the external eye. We are developing this drug as topical eye drops or eye lotion, in order to achieve maximum local drug effect while minimizing systemic exposure. We plan on testing these drug candidates against adenoviruses as well, to determine if the same drug would also be effective against epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis (EKC, the severe &#8220;pink eye&#8221; disease). If the same drug works against herpesvirus and adenovirus infections of the eye, this drug would cover almost 99% of all external eye viral pathologies. 

&#160; 

We believe that we will be able to develop a drug against HSV-2 genital herpes as well. We plan on developing a skin cream for this indication, to maximize local effectiveness. 

&#160; 

The FluCide&#8482; Program 

&#160; 

We are continuing our development of the FluCide&#8482; anti-influenza drug program at the next lower priority level after the HerpeCide program. We have two drugs in development in this program. The Injectable FluCide is designed to piggy-back into IV infusions for severely ill, hospitalized influenza patients. There are approximately 100,000 to 300,000 such cases in the USA alone annually. No current anti-influenza drugs are sufficiently effective to be of help in this scenario. We believe that our injectable FluCide would be substantially superior to current anti-influenza drugs and would be able to save lives in this scenario, based on the strong effectiveness in animal studies that has been observed. Following this drug, we are working on an Oral FluCide drug candidate for out-patient influenza treatment. 

&#160; 

We have recently announced collaboration with the Webster Lab at the St. Jude Children&#8217;s Hospital, TN, for the pre-clinical development program for both injectable and oral anti-influenza nanoviricide drug development. Given the several failures of anti-influenza drug developments that have led to increased burden of pre-clinical studies, our FluCide pre-clinical development program is expected to take longer than our HerpeCide&#8482; program IND-enabling pre-clinical studies. 

&#160; 

NanoViricides, Inc. is possibly the first company in the world in the entire field of nanomedicines to have developed an orally available nanomedicine drug with high effective bioavailability. We have previously estimated an effective bioavailability of about 30-35% for the oral form of an anti-influenza drug candidate comparing to the same drug given as injectable, based on animal studies. Our oral anti-influenza drug candidate has shown extremely high broad-spectrum effectiveness against two different influenza A viruses in animal models. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

In addition, we are developing a highly effective injectable anti-influenza drug. The Company is developing this injectable drug for hospitalized patients with severe influenza, including immuno-compromised patients. The Company believes that this drug may also be usable as a single-dose injection in a medical office for less severe cases of influenza. Both of these anti-influenza therapeutic candidates are &#8220;broad-spectrum&#8221;, i.e. they are expected to be effective against most if not all types of influenzas including H7N9, Bird Flu H5N1, other Highly Pathogenic Influenzas (HPI/HPAI), Epidemic Influenzas such as the 2009 &#8220;swine flu&#8221; H1N1/A/2009, and Seasonal Influenzas including the recent H3N2 influenza. The Company has already demonstrated that our anti-influenza drugs have significantly superior activity when compared to oseltamivir (Tamiflu&#174;) against two unrelated influenza A subtypes, namely, H1N1 and H3N2 in a highly lethal animal model. 

&#160; 

Our position that an injectable drug against influenza is a viable option is now affirmed by the approval of the very first injectable drug for influenza in December, 2014, namely peramivir (Rapivab, by BioCryst). Interestingly, peramivir as an injection was approved even though it did not appear to provide significant additional benefits over other drugs in its class. Overall, patients who received 600 mg of peramivir had symptom relief 21 hours sooner, on average, than those who received the placebo, which is consistent with other drugs in the same class. Additionally, peramivir injection was found to be not effective for hospitalized patients with severe influenza. 

&#160; 

Thus, an effective therapy for patients hospitalized with severe influenza continues to be an unmet need. 

&#160; 

In addition, a single injection treatment of non-hospitalized patients would be a viable drug if it provides superior benefits to existing therapies. 

&#160; 

Both of these anti-influenza drug candidates can be used as prophylactics to protect at-risk personnel such as health-care workers and immediate family members and caretakers of a patient. 

&#160; 

DengueCide&#8482; 

&#160; 

We are developing a broad-spectrum anti-dengue nanoviricide is in pre-clinical development in the DengueCide&#8482; program at a lower priority than FluCide. The Company is developing a broad-spectrum drug against Dengue viruses that is expected to be useful for the treatment of any of the four major serotypes of dengue viruses, including in severe cases of dengue (DSS) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). It is thought that DSS and DHF caused by prior antibodies against dengue that a patient&#8217;s body creates to fight a second unrelated dengue infection, and the second virus uses these antibodies effectively to hitch a ride into human cells, thereby causing a more severe infection than in naive patients. The Company has received an &#8220;Orphan Drug Designation&#8221; for our DengueCide TM drug from the USFDA as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This orphan drug designation carries significant economic benefits for the Company. We have previously achieved significant survival of mice in a lethal infection animal model of dengue disease. This model simulates antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue, which is believed to lead in humans to severe dengue, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. These studies were performed by Professor Eva Harris at the University of Berkeley.

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

HIVCide&#8482; 

&#160; 

Our HIVCide&#8482; program is currently receiving the lowest development priority primarily due to the extremely expensive nature of this program. The drug candidates in the HIVCide&#8482; program were found to have effectiveness equal to that of a triple drug HAART cocktail therapy in the standard humanized SCID-hu Thy/Liv mouse model. Moreover, the nanoviricides were long acting. Viral load suppression continued to hold for more than four weeks after stopping HIVCide treatment. The Company believes that this strong effect and sustained effect together indicate that HIVCide can be developed as a single agent that would provide &#8220;Functional Cure&#8221; from HIV/AIDS. The Company believes that substantially all HIV virus can be cleared upon HIVCide treatment, except the integrated viral genome in latent cells. This would enable discontinuation of treatment until HIV reemerges from the latent reservoir, which may be several months without any drugs. Moreover, the Company believes that this therapy would also minimize the chances of HIV transmission. The Company is currently optimizing the anti-HIV drug candidates. These drug candidates are effective against both the R5 and X4 subtypes of HIV-1 in cell cultures. The Company believes that these drug candidates are &#8220;broad-spectrum&#8221;, i.e. they are expected to be effective against most strains and mutants of HIV, and therefore escape of mutants from our drugs is expected to be minimal. Certain anti-HIV nanoviricides have already been demonstrated that appear to provide extended viral load suppression for as long as 30 days or more even after stopping the drug, in animal studies. Given the chronic nature of HIV/AIDS, such a drug that has long sustained effect is expected to provide significant benefits to the patient. We believe once a week dosing is possible. Anti-HIV drug development is both expensive and slow because of the nature of the animal studies that require SCID mice whose immune system is destroyed and then replaced by surgically implanting and growing human immune system tissues in the mouse body. Due to our limited resources, HIVCide development is further hampered. 

&#160; 

EKC 

&#160; 

In addition, the Company is developing broad-spectrum eye drops that are expected to be effective against a majority of the viral infections of the external eye. Most of these viral infections are from adenoviruses or from herpesviruses. The Company has shown excellent efficacy of its drug candidates against EKC (adenoviral epidemic kerato-conjunctivitis) in an animal model. If feasible, we are planning to merge the anti-EKC drug development program and the ocular Herpes Keratitis drug development program, to develop a single drug that is effective against both diseases, i.e. effective against both adenoviruses and herpesviruses. This work is in research stage. 

&#160; 

Other Drug Programs: Ebola, Rabies and others 

&#160; 

In addition to these eight drugs in development, the Company also has research programs against Rabies virus, Ebola and Marburg viruses, the recently emerged Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and others. We will not be undertaking socially important programs such as the development of an anti-Zika virus drug candidate, or continuation of our efforts in developing anti-Ebola drug candidate, unless non-dilutive funding for such efforts becomes available. 

&#160; 

To date, the Company does not have any commercialized products. The Company continues to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and also seeks to do so through an in-licensing strategy. 

&#160; 

Thus, this year, we have further focused our programs and prioritized them in order to advance our first drug candidate into the clinic in the near future. 

&#160; 

Safety and Toxicology Studies 

&#160; 

As part of the IND&#8211;enabling development of our Injectable FluCide&#8482; drug candidate, we previously performed initial safety-toxicology screening of an optimized FluCide&#174; drug candidate in a GLP-like toxicology study in rats. We reported that a good safety profile was observed for this drug candidate in rats, around the end of January 2015. These results are in agreement with the previously reported results of a non-GLP toxicology study in mice. The current study results also support the Company&#8217;s positive findings in animal models of infection with different influenza A virus strains in which no safety or toxicology concerns were observed. The Company has previously reported that many of its FluCide candidates demonstrated extremely high anti-influenza activity in those models. These results are extremely important since they indicate that FluCide continues to look very promising as one of the most advanced candidates in the Company&#8217;s drug development pipeline. 

&#160; 

We believe that these safety/toxicology results are also applicable to other drug candidates as well in the sense that they have established the safety of the polymer backbones that we have employed. The polymer is made up of PEG (polyethylene glycol) chains put together into a single polymer chain with ligands and pendant lipids substantially uniformly attached at the connector points. This enables the nanoviricide to be substantially non-immunogenic. PEG chain attachment or PEGylation is a widely used technique for rendering antibodies and other drugs substantially non-immunogenic. 

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

Clinical and Regulatory Strategy 

&#160; 

We have engaged Biologics Consulting Group, a well-known group of regulatory consultants, to advise us on the regulatory pathways, and the studies required for the IND applications for the various disease indications. 

&#160; 

We are developing a global clinical strategy in order to get our first drug candidate into the clinic as soon as feasible. To this end, we are studying the human clinical trials regulatory requirements in various countries, in particular, Australia, India, and the USA. It may be possible to start Phase I safety human clinical trials in Australia several months ahead of start of similar trials in the USA, provided that a cGMP-like or cGLP manufactured drug product can be entered into Phase I human clinical trials in Australia. [cGMP-like may be loosely interpreted as a drug product manufactured in a process that is compliant with the current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) Guidelines, although the facility may not yet be registered as a cGMP facility. cGLP product is generally interpreted as a drug product that is produced in compliance with current Good Laboratory Practices (cGLP), and therefore is a well characterized research product, but has not yet gone through the rigorous manufacturing quality and reproducibility requirements that are part of cGMP.] 

&#160; 

Large Market Sizes &#8211; The Company Targets an Overall Anti-Viral Drug Market Size that Exceeds $40B 

&#160; 

The current market size for drugs for the treatment of herpes infections is about $2~4B. We believe that when an effective topical treatment is introduced, the market size is likely to expand substantially. 

&#160; 

The approximate market size for severe cases of shingles may be in the billion-dollar range. Severe cases of shingles may lead to hospitalization in a few cases, possibly several thousands in the USA. In addition, shingles appearing on the face may reach the eye and may cause significant vision issues. The out-patient treatment market size for shingles at present is limited, because of the limited effectiveness of existing drugs. An effective drug could expand this market into billions of dollars globally. Novel shingles vaccines with improved effectiveness are in development. However, as shingles is not seen as a life-threatening or life-modifying disease, the use of vaccines is limited, and may continue to be limited, especially if an effective drug is developed. 

&#160; 

In addition, the estimated market size for an effective anti-Influenza drug is expected to be in tens of billions of dollars. The current estimate of anti-influenza drug market size is about $4B. Given the number of influenza cases annually, it is estimated that a successful oral anti-influenza drug could be a $50B or greater market. 

&#160; 

The current market size for anti-HIV treatments is in excess of $40B. 

&#160; 

Our New Campus in Shelton, CT 

&#160; 

We are happy to report that our new campus at Shelton, CT, is now mostly operative. With the expanded R&#38;D labs, Analytical Labs, the new Bio labs, the new Process Scale-Up production facility, and the new cGMP-capable manufacturing facility established at our new Shelton campus, we are in a much stronger position than ever to move our drug development programs into the clinic rapidly. 

&#160; 

We have substantially expanded our staff and skillset to accommodate the substantial workload associated with performing all of the studies for moving our advanced drug candidates towards IND filings. We have doubled our internal scientific staff, including the staff of our affiliates, during the reporting year. New staff also must undergo training in new techniques, methods, instrumentation, as well as our own internal processes. We have implemented strong project management processes in order to manage the multitude of our internal projects and sub-projects. 

&#160; 

We employ the same team that developed the small-scale synthesis chemistry for translation of those chemical syntheses into clinical-scale processes, and also to perform the related chemical engineering, quality control, quality assurance, and regulatory tasks along the way. This results in some serialization of efforts from small-scale synthesis to scale-up of production for clinical scale. However, the personnel cost, as well as the time and expense cost of transfer of knowledge and training of a separate dedicated team is avoided because the same expert scientists who have developed the chemistries are also involved in scaling them up into process scale. To enable such extensive multi-tasking, we have a continuous training program in place, with both formal and informal components. We believe that this approach helps us keep drug development costs as low as possible. 

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

Process Scale-Up Production Capability 

&#160; 

The Process Scale-up area is now operational at scales of about 200g to 500g per step for different chemical synthesis and processing steps. It comprises reactors and process vessels on chassis or skids, ranging from 1L to 30L capacities. Many of the reactors or vessels have been designed by us for specific tasks. 

&#160; 

cGMP Production Capability 

&#160; 

Our versatile, customizable cGMP-capable manufacturing facility is designed to support the production of kilogram-scale quantities of any of our nanoviricides drugs. In addition, it is designed to support the production of the drug in any formulation such as injectable, oral, skin cream, eye drops, lotions, etc. The production scale is designed so that clinical batches for Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III can be made in this facility. The clean room suite contains areas suitable for the production of sterile injectable drug formulations, which require special considerations. 

&#160; 

We have planned certain minimal infrastructure modifications to improve the capabilities of the cGMP-compliant facility, based on our experience in the Scale-up operations. Certain of these improvements are expected to add a separate production suite for manufacture of skin in an area that was designated for such further expansion. After these infrastructure improvements, we will need to produce at least three consecutive batches of a drug product and satisfy that said drug product is within our own defined specifications. After we are satisfied with such strong reproducibility of our processes, we plan to register the facility as a cGMP manufacturing facility with the US FDA. 

&#160; 

Our Virology Lab is now BSL-2 Certified 

&#160; 

Most importantly, we have significantly enhanced our internal anti-viral cell culture testing capabilities at our new Shelton campus. We have achieved BSL-2 (Biological Safety Level 2) certification from the State of Connecticut for our Virology suite at the new campus. This suite comprises three individual virology work-rooms, enabling us to work on several different viruses and strains at the same time. This facility is designed only for cell culture studies on viruses, and no animal studies can be conducted at any of our own facilities. We have brought in Brian Friedrich, Ph.D., as the Company&#8217;s Virologist. Dr. Friedrich has previously performed drug screening of hundreds of candidates against several viruses including alphaviruses, bunyaviruses, and filoviruses (namely, Ebola and Marburg, which are BSL-4), to discover potential therapeutics, while he was at United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). Brian has also worked extensively on Flaviviruses, specifically West Nile Virus, while at University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). He has also worked on HIV as part of his PhD thesis. Dengue viruses as well as the Zika virus belong to the Flavivirus family. We have already acquired certain Zika virus strains and Brian has already developed the cell culture assays that can help determine if a ligand is active against the Zika virus. Dr. Friedrich has also established assays for screening of candidates against VZV, and is in the process of developing assays for HSV-1 and HSV-2 as well. We believe that having developed the internal capabilities for cell culture testing of our ligands and nanoviricides against a variety of viruses has substantially strengthened our drug development programs. We believe that this internal screening enables extremely speedy evaluation of a much larger number of candidates than external collaborations allow. This has significantly improved our ability of finding highly effective ligands and performing structure-activity-relationship studies of the same in a short time period.

&#160; 

Manufacturing Requirements of Some of Our Drug Candidates 

&#160; 

The HerpeCide program drug product batch requirements are estimated to be fairly modest because of the topical nature of treatment. We are estimating that approximately 100g~200g batch will be sufficient for the &#8220;Tox Package&#8221; (i.e. safety and toxicology) studies. We are estimating that a ~200g batch will be more than sufficient for initial Phase-I human clinical studies. We already have the facilities for producing up to 1kg per batch. Many of our synthesis steps have already been scaled up to 200g~500g scales. The &#8220;nanomicelle&#8221; polymer manufacture is already scaled to ~500g scale. Thus we believe that we have sufficient production capability for the amounts of the HerpeCide drugs that would be needed for tox package as well as clinical studies.

&#160; 

As we move our drug candidates into clinical studies, we plan to perform further scale-up studies to get to about 1kg per batch production scale. In the current facility, we may be able to manufacture about 10kg to 20kg of cGMP product annually. Depending upon the drug&#8217;s potency and indication, this production size may fetch modest revenues of around $20M to $100M, enabling profitable market entry. Such initial commercialization would allow the Company to turn itself into a stand-alone pharmaceutical company, by enabling capital formation for larger scale manufacturing facilities and fueling further growth.

Patents, Trademarks, Proprietary Rights: Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The Company has an exclusive license in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the following virus types: HIV, Hepatitis C Virus, Herpes, Asian (bird) flu, Influenza, and rabies. The Company has entered into an Additional License Agreement with TheraCour granting the Company the exclusive licenses in perpetuity for technologies developed by TheraCour for the additional virus types for Dengue viruses, Japanese Encephalitis virus, West Nile Virus, Viruses causing viral Conjunctivitis (a disease of the eye) and Ocular Herpes, and Ebola/Marburg viruses. (Also please see under &#8220;Significant Alliances: Related Parties: TheraCour Pharma&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential for our operations. If we have a properly designed and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and intend to file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology. We also rely on trade secrets, internal know-how, technological innovations and agreements with third parties to develop, maintain and protect our competitive position. Our ability to be competitive will depend on the success of this strategy. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that the drugs by themselves, Injectable FluCide, Oral FluCide, DengueCide, HIVCide, Nanoviricide Eye Drops, HerpeCide, RabiCide, and others, may be eligible for patent protection. The Company plans on filing patent applications for protecting these drugs when we have definitive results from in-vitro or in-vivo studies that enable further drug development and IND application filing. 

&#160; 

The Company has licensed key patents, patent applications and rights to proprietary and patent-pending technologies related to our compounds, products and technologies (see Table 1), but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents.

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

We have previously announced certain important issuances of patents on the TheraCour&#174; technology underlying our nanoviricides&#174; drugs. A fundamental patent on the polymeric micelles composition, structure and uses was issued in the USA with substantially broad claims. This validates the novelty of our approach as well as our leadership position in the nanomedicines based on polymeric micelle technologies. This patent application has so far been issued, granted, and/or validated, with substantially similar broad claims as 52 different patents in different countries and multi-country intellectual property organizations. The Company announced in May 2012 that a fundamental patent, on which the nanoviricides&#174; technology is based, is due to be issued in the USA on May 8, 2012. The US Patent (No. 8,173,764) is granted for &#8220;Solubilization and Targeted Delivery of Drugs with Self-Assembling Amphiphilic Polymers.&#8221; It was issued on May 8, 2012. The patent term is expected to last through October 1, 2028, including anticipated extensions in compensation for time spent in clinical trials. This US Patent has been allowed with a very broad range of claims to a large number of families of chemical structure compositions, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of making the same, and uses of the same. The disclosed structures enable self-assembling, biomimetic nanomedicines. NanoViricides, Inc. holds exclusive, perpetual, worldwide licenses to these technologies for a broad range of antiviral applications and diseases. The other national and regional counterparts of the international Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT&#8221;) application number PCT/US06/01820, which was filed in 2006, have issued as a Singapore National Patent Publication, a South African patent, and also as an ARIPO regional patent, an OAPI regional patent (covering Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Togo). It has also issued as a granted patent in New Zealand, China, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Canada, several countries in Europe, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Pakistan, and Vietnam among others. Estimated expiry dates range nominally from 2026 to 2027 prior to accounting for various extensions available in different regions and countries. Additional issuances are continuing in Europe, and in several other countries around the world. 

&#160; 

Another fundamental patent application on the antivirals developed using the polymeric micelles has so far been issued, granted, and/or validated, with substantially broad claims as well, as 9 different patents. The counterparts of the international PCT application PCT/US2007/001607 have issued as a granted patent in ARIPO, Australia, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, OAPI, South Africa, and Korea to date. Additional issuances are expected in Europe, USA, and in several other countries around the world. This patent application teaches antivirals based on the TheraCour polymeric micelle technologies, their broad structures and compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of making the same, and their uses. The nominal expiry dates are expected to range from 2027 to 2029. Further patent prosecution in several other regions and countries is continuing. 

&#160; 

A total of, at least, 61 patents have been issued globally, on the basis of the two international PCT patent families that cover the fundamental aspects of our platform technology. Additional patent grants are expected to continue as the applications progress through prosecution processes. All of the resulting patents have substantially broad claims.

&#160; 

These patents have nominal expiry dates in 2026 to 2029. The dates can be further extended in several countries and regions for the additional allowances due to the regulatory burden of drug development process, or other local considerations, such as licensing to a local majority held company. Many countries allow up to five years extension for regulatory delays. 

&#160; 

No patent applications have been filed for the actual drug candidates that we intend to develop as drugs as of now. We intend to file the patent application for FluCide and HerpeCide before entering human clinical trials. The estimated expiry date for the FluCide and HerpeCide patents, if and when issued, would be no earlier than 2036-2037. 

&#160; 

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

Of the patents and technologies licensed, the Company believes that the Company will not be using the intellectual property, compositions of matter, or other aspects described and secured under the US Patent No. US 6,521,736. The Company believes that this patent describes an inferior technology compared to the technology in the later patent filings of Dr. Diwan. This patent, the Company believes, discloses prototype materials that served to establish the proof of principles developed by Dr. Anil Diwan, the Company&#8217;s President and co- founder, whether such materials were possible to create and whether such materials would indeed be capable of encapsulation of pharmaceutically relevant compounds. The Company believes that the new and novel compositions disclosed in the new patent applications, No. PCT/US06/01820, and No. PCT/US2007/001607, and additional proprietary intellectual property provide the necessary features that enable the development of nanoviricides. The Company believes that no other published literature materials or existing patents are capable of providing all of the necessary features for this development, to the best of our knowledge. However, the Company has no knowledge of the extensive active internal developments at a number of companies in the targeted therapeutics area. 

&#160; 

We may obtain patents for our compounds many years before we obtain marketing approval for them. Because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions, based on delays experienced in marketing products due to regulatory requirements. There is no assurance we would be able to obtain such extensions. The Company controls the research and work TheraCour performs on its behalf and no costs may be incurred without the prior authorization or approval of the Company. 

&#160; 

Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes such as those that cover our existing compounds, products and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Future litigation or reexamination proceedings regarding the enforcement or validity of our licensor, TheraCour Pharma Inc.&#8217;s existing patents or any future patents, could invalidate TheraCour&#8217;s patents or substantially reduce their protection. In addition, the pending patent applications and patent applications filed by TheraCour, may not result in the issuance of any patents or may result in patents that do not provide adequate protection. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from developing the same compounds and products that we have developed or are developing. In addition, certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. 

&#160; 

We also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. In particular, a great deal of our material manufacturing expertise, which is a key component of our core material technology, is not covered by patents but is instead protected as a trade secret. We protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by the individual while employed by us will be our exclusive property. We cannot be certain that these parties will comply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.

Glossary of Terms 

&#160; 

Nano - When used as a prefix for something other than a unit of measure, as in &#8220;nanoscience,&#8221; nano means relating to nanotechnology, or on a scale of nanometers (one billionth of a meter or greater). 

Viricide - An agent which reliably deactivates or destroys a virus. 

&#160; 

Nanoviricide &#174; &#8211; An agent which is made by attaching ligands against a certain virus or family of viruses to a nanomicelle based on the Company&#8217;s patent-pending and proprietary technologies. 

&#160; 

Ligand - A short peptide or chemical molecule fragment that has been designed to specifically recognize one particular type of virus. 

&#160; 

Micelle - an aggregate of molecules in a solution, such as those formed by detergents. 

&#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

Nanomicelle - A term coined to describe the micelles formed from the backbone polymer of a nanoviricide sans attached ligands. 

&#160; 

Pendant polymeric micelles - A polymeric micelle forms from a polymer whose chemical constitution is such that even a single chain of the polymer forms a micelle. A pendant polymer is a polymer that has certain units in its backbone that extend short chains branched away from the backbone. Pendant Polymeric Micelles therefore are polymeric micelle materials that are a class of pendant polymers, and naturally form exceptionally well-defined, self-assembling, globular micelles with a core-shell architecture. 

&#160; 

Mutations - The ability (of a virus) to change its genetic structure to avoid the body&#8217;s natural defenses. Mutant viruses are created from a parent virus strain through a process of natural selection under pressure as it replicates in a host. 

&#160; 

P-Value - In statistical hypothesis testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as that obtained, assuming that the null hypothesis is true; wherein the truth of the null hypothesis states that the finding was the result of chance alone. The fact that p-values are based on this assumption is crucial to their correct interpretation. The smaller the p-value, the greater is the probability that the observed study results and the comparison control are distinct, and therefore that the study results are not a result of chance alone. 

&#160; 

More technically, the p-value of an observed value observed of some random variable T used as a test statistic is the probability that, given that the null hypothesis is true, T will assume a value as or more unfavorable to the null hypothesis as the observed value observed. &#8220;More unfavorable to the null hypothesis&#8221; can in some cases mean greater than, in some cases less than and in some cases further away from a specified center value. 

&#160; 

Investigational New Drug Application (Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) - The process of licensure of a new drug in the US goes through several steps. A simplified explanation of these steps is as follows. Initially a Company may file a pre-IND application to seek meetings with the FDA for guidance on work needed for filing an IND application. The Company obtains data on the safety and effectiveness of the drug substance in various laboratory studies including cell cultures and animal models. The Company also obtains data on chemical manufacturing of the drug substance. These and certain additional data are used to create an IND which the Company files with the FDA. After the FDA approves an IND application, the Company may conduct human clinical studies. A Phase I human clinical trial is designed typically to evaluate safety of the drug and maximum permissible dosage level. A Phase II human clinical trial that follows is designed to evaluate effectiveness of the drug against the disease in a small cohort of patients. A Phase III human clinical trial thereafter is designed to evaluate effectiveness and safety in larger groups of patients, often at multiple sites. The Company may then submit an NDA (New Drug Application) with the data collected in the clinical trials. The FDA may approve the NDA. Once the NDA is approved, the Company can sell the drug in the USA. European countries have similar processes under the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Other countries have similar processes. 

&#160; 

SAR: Structure-Activity-Relationship study. When an initial lead drug compound is found that has activity, further studies on drug compounds obtained by suitably modifying it are performed with the goal of improving efficacy, safety, or both. Such studies are called SAR studies.

A Note on US FDA Priority Review Vouchers 

&#160; 

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of September 2007 authorizes the FDA to award a priority review voucher to any company that the FDA has determined is eligible for priority approval process for a treatment for a neglected tropical disease. The priority review voucher can be traded to another company in a manner similar to carbon (emissions) credit vouchers. The recipient company can save as much as six months on their drug review process, and it is anticipated that they would be willing to trade in vouchers with cash benefits to the company developing drugs against neglected tropical diseases. The regulation became effective as of September 30, 2008. 

&#160; 

Economists at Duke University, who proposed the voucher concept in 2006, have calculated that reduction of the FDA approval time from 18 to six months could be worth more than $300 million to a company with a top-selling drug with a net present value close to $3 billion. At this level, the voucher would be expected to offset the substantial investment and risk required for discovery and development of a new treatment for a neglected tropical disease. (David B. Ridley, Henry G. Grabowski and Jeffrey L. Moe, &#8220;Developing Drugs For Developing Countries&#8221;, Health Affairs, 25, no. 2 (2006): 313-324; doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.25.2.313; &#169; 2006 by Project Hope. and ( http://blogs.cgdev.org/globalhealth/2007/10/fda_priority_review.php ). Some of the PRVs have been &#8220;sold&#8221; for as much as $250M or so recently. 

&#160; 

While there is no indication whether NanoViricides, Inc. can obtain priority review for its drugs against neglected tropical diseases, the high efficacies of our drug candidates lead us to believe that this may be possible. FDA awards priority review status on the basis of several criteria. NanoViricides, Inc. is currently working on several neglected tropical diseases, including Dengue fever viruses, rabies, Ebola/Marburg viruses, among others. Of these, Dengue viruses are explicitly included in the list under this Public Law, and the remaining viruses are eligible for similar treatment according to the language in the Public Law, at the discretion of the Secretary of Health (Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, P.L. 110&#8211;85, Sept. 27, 2007, http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/fdaaa/PL110-85.pdf ). The Zika virus was added to this list recently. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

NanoViricides, Inc. currently has no products for sale. The Company currently has developed reasonably safe and effective drug candidates against eight different indications as demonstrated in pre-clinical cell culture and animal studies. The Company believes that with the funds on hand, it should be able to take at least two of these drug candidates into initial human clinical trials in the near future.
