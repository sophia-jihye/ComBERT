 Item 1. Business 

Callaway Golf Company (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Callaway Golf&#8221;) was incorporated in California in 1982 with the main purpose of designing, manufacturing and selling high quality golf clubs. The Company became a publicly traded corporation in 1992, and in 1999, reincorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company has evolved over time from a manufacturer of golf clubs to one of the leading manufacturers and distributors of a full line of golf equipment and accessories. 

The Company designs, manufactures and sells high quality golf clubs, golf balls, golf bags and other golf-related accessories. The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and in this regard invests a considerable amount in research and development each year. The Company&#8217;s golf products are designed for golfers of all skill levels, both amateur and professional, and are generally designed to conform to the Rules of Golf as published by the United States Golf Association ("USGA") and the ruling authority known as The R&#38;A. The Company has two reportable operating segments that are organized on the basis of products, namely the golf clubs segment and golf balls segment. The golf clubs segment consists of Callaway Golf woods, hybrids, irons and wedges and Odyssey putters. This segment also includes other golf-related accessories, royalties from licensing of the Company&#8217;s trademarks and service marks and sales of pre-owned golf clubs. The golf balls segment consists of Callaway Golf and Strata balls that are designed, manufactured and sold by the Company. 

The Company generally sells its products to retailers, directly and through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and to third-party distributors. The Company sells pre-owned golf products through its website, www.callawaygolfpreowned.com. In addition, the Company sells Callaway Golf and Odyssey products direct to consumers through its websites www.callawaygolf.com and www.odysseygolf.com. The Company also licenses its trademarks and service marks in exchange for a royalty fee to third parties for use on golf related accessories, including golf apparel and footwear, golf gloves, prescription eyewear and practice aids. The Company&#8217;s products are sold in the United States and in over 100 countries around the world.

The changes in foreign currency rates from 2013 through 2015 have had a significant negative impact on the Company's net sales. For a more detailed discussion regarding the changes in net sales for each product group from 2015 to 2014 and from 2014 to 2013, see below, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8221; contained in Item 7. 

The Company&#8217;s current principal products by product group are described below: 

Woods. &#32;This product category includes sales of the Company&#8217;s drivers, fairway woods and hybrid products, which are sold under the Callaway Golf brand. These products are generally made of metal (either titanium or steel) or a combination of metal 

and a composite material. The Company&#8217;s products compete at various price levels in the woods category. The Company&#8217;s drivers, fairway woods and hybrid products are available in a variety of lofts, shafts and other specifications to accommodate the preferences and skill levels of all golfers. 

Irons. &#32;This product category includes sales of the Company&#8217;s irons and wedges, which are sold under the Callaway Golf brand. The Company&#8217;s irons are generally made of metal (either titanium, steel or special alloy) or a composite material (a combination of metal and polymer materials). The Company&#8217;s products compete at various price levels in the irons category. The Company&#8217;s irons are available in a variety of designs, shafts and other specifications to accommodate the preferences and skill levels of all golfers. 

Putters. &#32;This product category includes sales of the Company&#8217;s putters, which are sold under the Odyssey brand. The Company&#8217;s products compete at multiple price levels in the putters category. The Company&#8217;s putters are available in a variety of styles, shafts and other specifications to accommodate the preferences and skill levels of all golfers. 

Golf Balls. &#32;This product category includes sales of the Company&#8217;s golf balls, which are sold under the Callaway Golf and Strata brands. The Company&#8217;s golf balls are generally either a 2-piece golf ball (consisting of a core and cover) or a multilayer golf ball (consisting of two or more components in addition to the cover). The Company&#8217;s golf ball products include covers that incorporate a traditional dimple pattern as well as covers that incorporate innovative designs, including the Company&#8217;s proprietary HEX Aerodynamics (i.e., a lattice of tubes that form hexagons and pentagons). The Company&#8217;s products compete at multiple price levels in the golf ball category. 

Accessories and Other. &#32;This product category includes sales of packaged sets, golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel, travel gear, headwear, towels, umbrellas, eyewear and other accessories, as well as sales of pre-owned products through the Company's website, www.callawaygolfpreowned.com. Additionally, this product category includes royalties from licensing of the Company&#8217;s trademarks and service marks on products including golf apparel and footwear, golf gloves, prescription eyewear and practice aids. 

Product Design and Development 

Product design at the Company is a result of the integrated efforts of its brand management, research and development, manufacturing and sales departments, all of which work together to generate new ideas for golf equipment. The Company designs its products to be technologically advanced and has not limited itself in its research efforts by trying to duplicate designs that are traditional or conventional and believes it has created a work environment in which new ideas are valued and explored. In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the Company invested $33.2 million , $31.3 million &#32;and $30.9 million , respectively, in research and development. The Company intends to continue to invest substantial amounts in its research and development activities in connection with its development of new products. 

The Company has the ability to create and modify product designs by using computer aided design (&#8220;CAD&#8221;) software, computer aided manufacturing (&#8220;CAM&#8221;) software and computer numerical control milling equipment. CAD software enables designers to develop computer models of new product designs. CAM software is then used by engineers to translate the digital output from CAD computer models so that physical prototypes can be produced. Further, the Company utilizes a variety of testing equipment and computer software, including golf robots, launch monitors, a proprietary virtual test center, a proprietary performance analysis system, an indoor test range and other methods to develop and test its products. Through the use of these technologies, the Company has been able to accelerate and make more efficient the design, development and testing of new golf clubs and golf balls. 

For certain risks associated with product design and development, see below, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A. 

Manufacturing 

The Company has its primary golf club assembly facility in Monterrey, Mexico, and maintains limited golf club assembly in its facilities in Carlsbad, California. The Company's golf clubs are also assembled in China, Japan and other local markets based on regional demand for custom clubs. In addition, the Company utilizes golf club contract manufacturers in China. 

In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , most of the Company&#8217;s golf club production volume was made in regions outside of the United States. Overall, the golf club assembly process is fairly labor intensive and requires extensive global supply chain coordination and utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States. 

The Company has a golf ball manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts, and also utilizes golf ball contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan. In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , approximately 60% of the golf ball production volume was manufactured in regions outside of the United States. The overall golf ball manufacturing process utilizes raw materials that are obtained from suppliers both internationally and within the United States and, although a significant amount of labor is used, is much more automated than the golf club assembly process. 

The Company has its primary distribution center in Dallas, Texas for the distribution of goods in North America, in addition to distribution centers in Swindon, England and Melbourne, Australia, and third-party logistical operations in Tokyo, Japan, Shanghai, China, and Seoul, Korea to support the distribution needs of those markets. 

Raw Materials 

The Company purchases raw materials from domestic and international suppliers in order to meet scheduled production needs. Raw materials include steel, titanium alloys and carbon fiber for the manufacturing of golf clubs, and synthetic rubber, thermoplastics, zinc stearate, zinc oxide and lime stone for the manufacturing of golf balls. For certain risks associated with golf club and golf ball manufacturing, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales in the United States 

Of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, approximately 53% was derived from sales to customers within the United States in 2015, and approximately 48% in each of 2014 and 2013. The Company primarily sells to both on- and off-course golf retailers and sporting goods retailers who sell quality golf products and provide a level of customer service appropriate for the sale of such products. The Company also sells certain products to mass merchants. Sales of the Company&#8217;s products in the United States are made and supported by full-time regional field representatives and in-house sales and customer service representatives. Most regions in the United States are covered by both a field representative and a dedicated in-house sales representative who work together to initiate and maintain relationships with customers through frequent telephone calls and in-person visits. 

In addition, other dedicated sales representatives provide service to corporate customers who want their corporate logo imprinted on the Company&#8217;s golf balls, putters or golf bags. The Company imprints the logos on the majority of these corporate products, thereby retaining control over the quality of the process and final product. The Company also pays a commission to certain on- and off-course professionals and retailers with whom it has a relationship for corporate sales that originate through such professionals and retailers. 

The Company also has a separate team of club fitting specialists who focus on the Company&#8217;s custom club sales. A portion of the Company&#8217;s custom club sales are generated from the utilization of club fitting programs, such as performance centers, which utilize high-speed cameras and precision software to capture relevant swing data. All performance centers and participating on- and off-course retail stores are equipped with custom fitting systems that incorporate the use of an extensive variety of clubhead and shaft combinations in order to find a set of golf clubs that fits a golfer&#8217;s personal specifications. The Company believes that offering golfers the opportunity to increase performance with custom club specifications increases sales and promotes brand loyalty. 

The Company maintains various sales programs, including a Preferred Retailer Program. The Preferred Retailer Program offers longer payment terms during the initial sell-in period, as well as potential rebates and discounts for participating retailers in exchange for providing certain benefits to the Company, including the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels, prime product placement and retailer staff training. 

Sales Outside of the United States 

Of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, approximately 47% &#32;was derived from sales for distribution outside of the United States in 2015 , and approximately 52% &#32;in each of 2014 and 2013. The Company does business (either directly or through its subsidiaries and distributors) in over 100 countries around the world. 

The majority of the Company&#8217;s international sales are made through its wholly-owned subsidiaries located in Japan, Europe, Korea, Canada, Australia, China and India. In addition to sales through its subsidiaries, the Company also sells through its network of distributors in over 70 foreign countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, and in numerous countries in Central and South America. Prices of golf clubs and balls for sales by distributors outside of the United States generally reflect an export pricing discount to compensate international distributors for selling and distribution costs. A change in the Company&#8217;s relationship with significant distributors could negatively impact the volume of the Company&#8217;s international sales. 

The Company&#8217;s sales programs in foreign countries are specifically designed based upon local laws and competitive conditions. Some of the sales programs utilized include the custom club fitting experiences and the Preferred Retailer Program or variations of those programs employed in the United States as described above. 

Conducting business outside of the United States subjects the Company to increased risks inherent in international business. These risks include but are not limited to foreign currency risks, increased difficulty in protecting the Company&#8217;s intellectual property rights and trade secrets, unexpected government action or changes in legal or regulatory requirements, and social, economic or political instability. For a complete discussion of the risks associated with conducting business outside of the United States, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A. 

Sales of Pre-Owned Clubs and Online Store 

The Company sells certified pre-owned golf products in addition to golf-related accessories through its website www.callawaygolfpreowned.com. The Company generally acquires the pre-owned products through the Company&#8217;s Trade In! Trade Up! program, which gives golfers the opportunity to trade in their used Callaway Golf clubs and certain competitor golf clubs at authorized Callaway Golf retailers or through the Callaway Golf Pre-Owned website for credit toward the purchase of new or pre-owned Callaway Golf equipment. 

The Company also offers the full line of Callaway Golf and Odyssey products, including drivers, fairway woods, hybrids, irons, putters, golf balls and golf-related accessories, through its websites www.callawaygolf.com and www.odysseygolf.com. 

Advertising and Promotion 

The Company develops and executes its advertising and promotional campaigns for its products based on the Company&#8217;s global brand principles. Within the United States, the Company has focused its advertising efforts mainly on web-based advertising and in-store advertising, along with a combination of printed advertisements in national magazines, such as Golf Magazine, Sports Illustrated and Golf Digest, and television commercials, primarily on The Golf Channel and on network television during golf telecasts. Advertising of the Company&#8217;s products outside of the United States is generally handled by the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries, and while it is based on the Company&#8217;s global brand principles, the local execution is tailored to each region based on its unique consumer market and lifestyles. 

In addition, the Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to promote the Company&#8217;s products. The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional golf tours to promote the Company&#8217;s golf club and golf ball products as well as golf bags and various golf accessories. For certain risks associated with such endorsements, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A. 

Competition 

The golf club markets in which the Company competes are highly competitive and are served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names. With respect to drivers, fairway woods and irons, the Company&#8217;s major competitors are TaylorMade, Ping, Acushnet (Titleist brand), Puma (Cobra brand), SRI Sports Limited (Cleveland and Srixon brands), Mizuno, Bridgestone and Nike. For putters, the Company&#8217;s major competitors are Acushnet (Titleist brand), Ping and TaylorMade. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in every golf club market in which it competes. 

The golf ball business is also highly competitive. There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including Acushnet (Titleist and Pinnacle brands), SRI Sports Limited (Dunlop and Srixon brands), Bridgestone (Bridgestone and Precept brands), Nike, TaylorMade and others. These competitors compete for market share in the golf ball business, with Acushnet having a market share of over 50% of the golf ball business in the United States and a leading position in certain other regions outside the United States. The Company believes that it is a technological leader in the golf ball market. 

For both golf clubs and golf balls, the Company generally competes on the basis of technology, quality, performance, customer service and price. In order to gauge the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s response to such factors, management receives and evaluates Company-generated market trends for U.S. and foreign markets, as well as periodic public and customized market research for the U.S. and U.K. markets from Golf Datatech that include trends from certain on- and off-course retailers. In addition, the Company utilizes Sports Marketing Surveys for the U.K. markets and GfK Group for the markets in Japan. 

For certain risks associated with competition, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A. 

Seasonality of Company's Business 

In most of the regions where the Company does business, the game of golf is played primarily on a seasonal basis. Weather conditions in most parts of the world generally restrict golf from being played year-round, with many of the Company&#8217;s on-course customers closing during the cold weather months. The Company&#8217;s business is therefore subject to seasonal fluctuations. In general, during the first quarter, the Company begins selling its products into the golf retail channel for the new golf season. This initial sell-in generally continues into the second quarter. The Company&#8217;s second-quarter sales are significantly affected by the amount of reorder business of the products sold during the first quarter. The Company&#8217;s third-quarter sales are generally dependent on reorder business but are generally less than the second quarter as many retailers begin decreasing their inventory levels in anticipation of the end of the golf season. The Company&#8217;s fourth-quarter sales are generally less than the other quarters due to the end of the golf season in many of the Company&#8217;s key markets. However, third-quarter sales can be affected by a mid-year launch of product, and fourth-quarter sales can be affected from time to time by the early launch of product introductions related to the new golf season of the subsequent year. This seasonality, and therefore quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, can be affected by many factors, including the timing of new product introductions as well as weather conditions. In general, however, because of this seasonality, a majority of the Company&#8217;s sales and most, if not all, of its profitability generally occurs during the first half of the year. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of certain materials, substances and wastes and the remediation of environmental contaminants (collectively, &#8220;Environmental Laws&#8221;). In the ordinary course of its manufacturing processes, the Company uses paints, chemical solvents and other materials, and generates waste by-products that are subject to these Environmental Laws. In addition, in connection with the Company's Top-Flite asset acquisition in 2003, the Company assumed certain monitoring and remediation obligations at its manufacturing facility in Chicopee, Massachusetts. In February 2013, the Company sold this facility and leased back a reduced portion of the square footage that it believes is adequate for its ongoing golf ball manufacturing operations. As part of the terms of this sale, the Company assumed certain ongoing environmental remediation obligations. 

The Company adheres to all applicable Environmental Laws and takes action as necessary to comply with these laws. The Company maintains an environmental and safety program and employs full-time environmental, health and safety professionals at its facilities located in Carlsbad, California, Chicopee, Massachusetts and Monterrey, Mexico. The environmental and safety program includes obtaining environmental permits as required, capturing and appropriately disposing of any waste by-products, tracking hazardous waste generation and disposal, air emissions, safety situations, material safety data sheet management, storm water management and recycling, and auditing and reporting on its compliance. 

Historically, the costs of environmental compliance have not had a material adverse effect upon the Company&#8217;s business. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws. 

Sustainability 

The Company believes it is important to conduct its business in an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable manner. In this regard, the Company has an environmental sustainability program which focuses on the reductions of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, reductions of hazardous waste, reductions in water usage, improved recycling and development programs which involve the elimination or reduction of undesirable chemicals and solvents in favor of safer and environmentally preferred alternatives. These efforts cross divisional lines and are visible in the following areas within the Company: 

&#8226; 

Facilities through the partnership with local utilities to implement energy reduction initiatives such as energy efficient lighting, demand response energy management and heating, ventilation and air conditioning optimization; 

&#8226; 

Manufacturing through lean initiatives and waste minimization; 

&#8226; 

Product development through specification of environmentally preferred substances; 

&#8226; 

Logistics improvements and packaging minimization; and 

&#8226; 

Supply chain management through Social, Safety and Environmental Responsibility audits of suppliers. 

The Company also has two existing programs focusing on the community: the Callaway Golf Company Foundation and the Callaway Golf Company Employee Community Giving Program. Through these programs the Company and its employees are able to give back to the community through monetary donations and by providing community services. Information on both of these programs is available on the Company&#8217;s website www.callawaygolf.com. By being active and visible in the community and 

by embracing the principles of environmental stewardship, the Company believes it is acting in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. 

Intellectual Property 

The Company is the owner of approximately 3,000 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and over 1,300 U.S. and foreign patents relating to the Company&#8217;s products, product designs, manufacturing processes and research and development concepts. Other patent and trademark applications are pending and await registration. In addition, the Company owns various other protectable rights under copyright, trade dress and other statutory and common laws. The Company&#8217;s intellectual property rights are very important to the Company and the Company seeks to protect such rights through the registration of trademarks and utility and design patents, the maintenance of trade secrets and the creation of trade dress. When necessary and appropriate, the Company enforces its rights through litigation. Information regarding current litigation matters in connection with intellectual property is contained in Note 10 &#32;&#8220; Commitments &#38; Contingencies &#8212;Legal Matters&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

The Company&#8217;s patents are generally in effect for up to 20 years from the date of the filing of the patent application. The Company&#8217;s trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to become generic. For certain risks associated with intellectual property, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in Item 1A. 

Licensing 

The Company, in exchange for a royalty fee, licenses its trademarks and service marks to third parties for use on products such as golf apparel and footwear, golf gloves, prescription eyewear and practice aids. With respect to its line of golf apparel, the Company has current licensing arrangements with Perry Ellis International for a complete line of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s apparel for distribution in certain retail channels in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, and TSI Groove &#38; Sports for a complete line of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s apparel for distribution in Asia and Asia Pacific countries. With respect to the footwear lines, the Company has a licensing arrangement with AMG-SF, LLC for a complete line of men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s golf footwear for distribution in certain retail channels in the United States and Canada. 

In addition, the Company has also licensed its trademarks to, among others, (i) IZZO Golf for practice aids, (ii) SM Global, LLC for golf gloves sold exclusively to Costco Wholesale Corp. and (iii) Walman Optical for a line of prescription Callaway eyewear. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 1,700 full-time and part-time employees. The Company employs temporary manufacturing workers as needed based on labor demands that fluctuate with the Company's seasonality. 

The Company&#8217;s golf ball manufacturing employees in Chicopee, Massachusetts are unionized and are covered under a collective bargaining agreement, which expires on September 30, 2017. In addition, certain of the Company&#8217;s production employees in Australia and Mexico are also unionized. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.
