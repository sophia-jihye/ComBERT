 Item 1. Business. 

Deluxe Corporation was founded in 1915 and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota in 1920. From 1920 until 1988, our company was named Deluxe Check Printers, Incorporated. Our principal corporate offices are located at 3680 Victoria Street North, Shoreview, Minnesota 55126-2966. Our main telephone number is (651) 483-7111 and our web address is www.deluxe.com. 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

Over 100 years ago, Deluxe Corporation began providing payment solutions. Our longevity is a testament to our innovation and our ability to evolve with our customers.

Our vision is to be the best at helping small businesses and financial institutions grow.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

Our business segments are generally organized by type of customer served and reflect the way we manage the company. Additional information concerning our segments appears under the caption &#8220;Note 16: Business segment information&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. 

Small Business Services 

Small Business Services operates under various brands including Deluxe &#174; , NEBS &#174; , Safeguard &#174; , PsPrint &#174; , Hostopia &#174; , Logo Mojo &#174; , Aplus.net &#174; , OrangeSoda &#174; and VerticalResponse &#174; . This is our largest segment in terms of revenue and operating income and we are concentrating on profitably growing this segment. Small Business Services strives to be a leading supplier to small businesses, as well as partners and channels who support small businesses, by providing personalized products and services that help them operate and market their businesses. This segment sells products and services to small businesses in North America and portions of South America and Europe. 

Small Business Services' products are distributed through more than one channel. Our primary customer acquisition methods are direct response mail and internet advertising; referrals from financial institutions, telecommunications clients and other partners; Safeguard distributors; a network of independent local dealers; and a growing direct sales force that focuses on selling to and through major accounts. These efforts are supplemented by the account development efforts of an outbound telemarketing group. Customer service for initial order support, product reorders and routine service is provided by a network of call center representatives located throughout the United States and Canada. 

Our Small Business Services strategies are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Effectively acquire and retain customers by optimizing each of our sales channels; 

&#8226; 

Expand sales of higher growth marketing solutions and other services; 

&#8226; 

Increase our share of the amount small businesses spend on the types of products and services in our portfolio through increased brand awareness, channel coverage, and improved customer acquisition; and 

&#8226; 

Continue to optimize our cost and expense structure. 

We continue to invest in several key enablers to achieve our strategies and reposition Small Business Services as not just a provider of business checks and printed forms, but also as a provider of higher growth marketing solutions and other services. These key enablers include attracting new customers, strengthening our portfolio of products and services, improving our use of technology, growing our distributor channel, and enhancing brand awareness and positioning. 

We focus on identifying opportunities to expand sales to our existing customers and to acquire new customers, including the small business customer referrals we receive through our Deluxe Business Advantage&#174; program. This program provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses. Our relationships with financial institutions are important in helping us more deeply serve unique customer segments such as contractors, retailers and professional services firms. In addition, we continue to acquire customers through our telecommunications clients, media partners and major account clients. We continue to invest in our e-commerce and technology platforms to increase opportunities to market and sell on-line, and we utilize various marketing channels, including internet, direct mail solicitations and television. Our Safeguard distributor channel, dealer network and major accounts channels increase our distribution reach through dedicated &#8220;feet on the street,&#8221; resellers and partner operations, and allow us to grow sales to existing customers and acquire new customers in multiple ways. To support growth, we have also acquired the operations of several small business distributors that sell marketing solutions and other services, accessories, checks and forms. 

We continuously evaluate ways to strengthen our portfolio of products and services, both through acquisitions and organic solution development. In recent years, we have acquired new businesses that have expanded our marketing solutions and other services offerings, including technology-based solutions such as web services, web-to-print capabilities, internet marketing services and eChecks. Sales of these higher growth products and services are expected to represent an increasing portion of our revenue. During 2015, we completed several asset acquisitions: Range, Inc. and FMC Resource Management Corporation, both marketing services providers; Verify Valid LLC, a provider of electronic check services; Tech Assets, Inc., a provider of shared hosting websites using strategic control panel technology; as well as purchases of several small business distributors. In 2014, we acquired selected assets of Gift Box Corporation of America, a supplier of retail packaging solutions, including gift boxes, bows, ribbon and wraps. This business operates under the name WholeStyle Packaging TM . 

Over the past several years, investments in promoting and strengthening the Deluxe brand continue to increase brand awareness and loyalty. Our advertising campaigns encourage small business owners to view us as a business partner who can provide many of the key elements they need to operate and promote their business, so the owners can focus instead on personal satisfaction, the primary motivator for today's small business owner. In 2015, we used our 100-year anniversary as an opportunity to drive brand awareness. We completed a documentary campaign that highlighted 100 small businesses from across the country and focused on the owners' personal satisfaction and drive, as well as their impact on communities, culture and the economy. Our brand awareness efforts are very purpose-driven in nature, helping drive customers to small businesses on our path to increased brand awareness. In 2016, we plan to continue our campaign with more small business stories, 

including advice for other small business owners based on what we learned from the 100 businesses featured in 2015. We also plan to produce a web series that showcases small businesses, while incorporating marketing lessons. Lastly, our partnership with Robert Herjavec of the television show Shark Tank &#32;offers us the opportunity to provide marketing support to the businesses in which he invests. 

We continue our efforts within Small Business Services to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. Small Business Services outsources the production of some of its products, including certain business forms, promotional products and apparel. In conjunction with our cost reduction initiatives, we continually seek to further enhance our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements. In addition, the expertise we have developed in logistics, productivity and inventory management has allowed us to reduce the number of facilities we operate, while still meeting client requirements. During January 2016, we closed a call center located in Los Angeles, California, and during 2015, we closed a facility located in American Fork, Utah that housed a call center and administrative functions, as well as a call center located in Charlotte, North Carolina and a sales facility located in Venice, California. The operations of these facilities were integrated into existing Small Business Services operations. 

Financial Services 

Financial Services' products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force, which executes product and service supply contracts with our financial institution clients nationwide, including banks, credit unions and financial services companies. Building on our long-standing reputation in the financial services market as a leading check provider, we have expanded our offerings to include a growing suite of software-based products and services designed to help financial institutions better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle. Our sales force is selling these life cycle management solutions through our existing financial institution customer channel to existing clients and to new clients. 

Our Financial Services strategies are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Optimize core check revenue streams and acquire new clients; 

&#8226; 

Expand sales of higher growth marketing solutions and other services that differentiate us from the competition; and 

&#8226; 

Continue to optimize our cost and expense structure. 

Check supply contracts usually range in duration from three to six years. We continue to focus on maintaining high client retention and on acquiring new clients, adding new large financial institution clients in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the third quarter of 2013. As part of our check programs, we provide enhanced services such as customized reporting, file management, expedited account conversion support, trackable delivery and billing services. Consumers typically submit their check order to their financial institution, which then forwards the order to us. Consumers may also submit their check orders over the phone or internet. We process the order and ship it directly to the consumer. Financial Services produces a wide range of check designs, with many consumers preferring one of the dozens of licensed or cause-related designs we offer. We also continue to leverage our Deluxe Business Advantage program, which is designed to maximize financial institution business check programs. It offers many of the products and services of our Small Business Services segment to the small business customers of financial institutions through a number of service level options. The revenue from the products and services sold through this program is reflected in our Small Business Services segment. 

In our ongoing efforts to expand well beyond our legacy check-related products, we offer several solutions designed to help financial institutions operate more effectively and better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle. All of these offerings build on our reputation as a longstanding and trusted partner of financial institutions, especially when it comes to outsourced solutions and securely managing sensitive customer data. Our service offerings include the following: 

&#8226; 

Wausau Financial Systems &#8211; a comprehensive suite of treasury management solutions available at the customer site, as well as via software-as-a-service and business process outsourced deployment models, including the offerings of FISC Solutions, which was acquired in December 2015. 

&#8226; 

Deluxe Rewards &#8211; a loyalty and rewards program that offers multiple touch points that enable our clients to have ongoing engagement with their customers. 

&#8226; 

Deluxe Marketing Services &#8211; a variety of direct marketing solutions that help financial institutions acquire new customers, deepen existing customer relationships and retain customers. These offerings leverage data and analytics to help our clients execute marketing campaigns for depository and lending products across multiple contact channels, including direct mail, email, online and digital. This suite of offerings was recently augmented with our October 2015 acquisition of Datamyx &#174; , a software-as-a-service data and analytics platform focused on marketing programs for lending products. 

&#8226; 

Banker's Dashboard &#174; &#32;&#8211; online financial management tools that provide financial institutions with comprehensive daily insights into their financial picture. 

&#8226; 

Deluxe Strategic Sourcing &#8211; a comprehensive, outsourced service that enables financial institutions to improve efficiency, financial controls and pricing across manifold supplier relationships. 

&#8226; 

Deluxe Detect &#174; &#32;&#8211; a new account online screening tool. 

&#8226; 

Deluxe Provent SM &#32;&#8211; a comprehensive suite of identity protection services largely complimentary to our check offerings. 

&#8226; 

SwitchAgent &#174; &#32;&#8211; a digital channel onboarding solution enabling consumers to easily set up the online banking aspects of a new account, making it easier for financial institutions to attract and anchor new customers. 

We are advancing our marketing solutions and other services offerings both organically and via acquisitions. In October 2015, we acquired Datamyx LLC, which operates a software-as-a-service platform for data analytics-driven marketing solutions, and in December 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of FISC Solutions, which provides back-office treasury management and outsourcing services. In October 2014, we acquired Wausau Financial Systems, Inc., a provider of software-based and outsourced solutions for treasury management to financial institutions and large corporations. 

We expect that providing a growing suite of products and services will offset the impacts of the decline in check usage and the contract renewal allowances we are experiencing in our check programs. As such, we continue to focus on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services. During the past year, we have also invested in extending the Deluxe brand to increase brand awareness and loyalty in the financial services market beyond check-related solutions. 

Financial Services continues to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. During 2015, we closed a call center located in Plymouth, Michigan, as well as a warehouse located in Livonia, Michigan, and moved these operations into an existing facility. 

Direct Checks 

Direct Checks is the nation's leading direct-to-consumer check supplier, selling under various brand names, including Checks Unlimited &#174; , Designer &#174; &#32;Checks, Checks.com &#174; , Check Gallery &#174; , The Styles Check Company &#174; , and Artistic Checks &#174; , among others. 

We use a variety of direct marketing techniques to acquire new customers, including newspaper inserts, in-package advertising, statement stuffers and co-op advertising. We also use search engine marketing and search engine optimization strategies to direct traffic to our websites, which include: checksunlimited.com, designerchecks.com, checks.com, 4checks.com, checkgallery.com, styleschecks.com, and artisticchecks.com, among others. 

Direct Checks competes primarily on price and design. We believe that pricing in the direct-to-consumer channel is generally lower than retail prices charged to consumers in the financial institution channel. We compete on design by seeking to offer the most attractive selection of images with high consumer appeal, many of which are licensed from well-known artists and organizations. 

Our Direct Checks strategies are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features, accessories and products; 

&#8226; 

Continue to optimize our cost and expense structure; and 

&#8226; 

Optimize cash flow. 

We continue to actively market our products and services through targeted advertising, including a continued focus on the internet channel. We continue to explore avenues to increase sales to existing customers. One example is the check protection service we offer in partnership with EZShield, Inc., which provides reimbursement to consumers for losses resulting from forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks. As in our other two business segments, Direct Checks continues to simplify processes, eliminate complexity and lower costs. We continue to identify additional opportunities to lower our cost and expense structure in all functional areas, particularly in the areas of marketing and fulfillment. 

MANUFACTURING AND FULFILLMENT/SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES 

We continue to focus on improving the customer experience by providing excellent service and quality, reducing costs and increasing productivity. We accomplish this by embedding lean operating principles in all processes, while emphasizing a culture of continuous improvement. Under this approach, employees work together to produce products, rather than working on individual tasks in a linear fashion. Because employees assume more ownership of the end product, we experience improved quality and productivity, as well as lower costs. 

We continue to sponsor &#8220;sustainability&#8221; initiatives that encompass environmentally-friendly practices. We have aligned with suppliers that promote sustainable business practices and we continually seek opportunities to eliminate wasted material, reduce cycle times and use more environmentally-friendly materials. More than 90% of our check and form paper is purchased from Forest Stewardship Council certified supplier mills, most of our vinyl checkbook covers are produced utilizing a minimum of 40% post-industrial recycled material and we use environmentally-friendly janitorial supplies. Our sustainability initiatives have also benefited our results of operations over the past several years as we focus on reducing our consumption of water, electricity and natural gas, and improving our transportation efficiency. We continue efforts to reduce solid waste sent to landfills, and we have been a member of the Environmental Protection Agency's Green Power Leadership Club since 2010. The green power that we purchased during 2015 amounted to more than 75% of our annual U.S. electricity needs. 

The expertise we have developed in logistics, productivity and inventory management has allowed us to reduce the number of production facilities we operate, while still meeting client requirements. During February 2016, we moved production out of our Lancaster, California manufacturing facility and integrated it into existing facilities. During 2015, we closed our Plymouth, Michigan and Burnsville, Minnesota fulfillment operations; during 2014, we closed our Bethlehem, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility; and during 2013, we closed our New Albany, Indiana manufacturing facility. These operations were moved to other existing locations. We have also expanded our use of digital printing processes and enhanced our web-to-print capabilities. 

We have a shared services approach, which allows our three business segments to leverage shared manufacturing facilities to optimize capacity utilization, enhance operational excellence and foster a culture of continuous improvement. We continue to reduce costs by utilizing our assets and printing technologies more efficiently and by enabling employees to better leverage their capabilities and talents. 

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 

Checks 

According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2013, debit card, credit card and ACH payments all exceeded the number of checks written in 2012. Approximately 21.0 billion checks were written in 2012, accounting for approximately 17% of all non-cash payment transactions. This is a reduction from the Federal Reserve Study released in December 2010 when checks accounted for approximately 25% of all non-cash payment transactions. The Federal Reserve estimates that checks written declined approximately 8.8% per year between 2009 and 2012. The decline in our check order volume was lower than the Federal Reserve estimate, likely due to our various marketing investments and other factors affecting the timing of check orders, such as moves and household formations. However, we expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative. In addition, steps have been taken in the development of a real-time payments system in the United States. In January 2015, the Federal Reserve published Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System , which calls on stakeholders to join together to improve the payment system, including developing a faster electronic solution for making a broad variety of business and personal payments. As a result, the Faster Payments Task Force was established with the objective of identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a faster payments system. The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC (TCH), owned by some of the world's largest commercial banks, has announced that it is moving ahead with concrete plans for a real-time payments system. It has entered into a letter of intent with a United Kingdom-based international payment systems provider to help build and deliver core elements of the real-time payments network and has partnered with a domestic banking technology provider to leverage its existing relationships and key components of its payments technologies. While TCH has not specified a delivery date for the system, the company did state that it would take far less time than the 10 years the Federal Reserve once suggested as a possible timetable. A related study commissioned by the Federal Reserve from McKinsey &#38; Company concluded that check usage could be reduced by one-third if a real-time payments system were to become widely available in the United States. 

The rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. 

In addition to the shift to electronic payment methods, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts also impact the number of checks consumers use. Moderate growth in consumer spending and private sector employment during 2015 most likely had a neutral impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau in January 2016, housing units completed during 2015 increased 9% as compared to 2014. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future. 

Small Business Customers 

According to data published by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2013, the most recent period for which information is available, there were approximately 30.5 million small businesses in the United States, defined as independent businesses having fewer than 500 employees. According to data published by the Small Business Branch of Industry Canada in August 2013, the most recent data available, there are just over one million small businesses in Canada with employees, and 98% of all businesses in Canada have fewer than 100 employees. 

The small business market is impacted by general economic conditions and the rate of small business formations. Small business confidence declined during 2015. The index of small business optimism published by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) was 100.4 in December 2014 and ended 2015 at 95.2, well below the 42-year average of 98. The percentage of small business owners that expect general business conditions to improve within six months also decreased from December 2014. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, 

more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. In recent years, we believe the economy negatively impacted our operating results and/or our growth opportunities, and we expect the economic environment will continue to be challenging in 2016. 

Sales of business checks and forms have been declining, and we expect this trend to continue. In addition to the decrease in the use of checks due to the availability of alternative payment methods, continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will gain widespread acceptance. 

Financial Institution Clients 

Checks are most commonly ordered through financial institutions, including banks, credit unions and other financial services companies. As such, several developments related to financial institutions have affected the check printing portion of the payments industry. 

Financial institutions seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated from their check programs, despite the decline in check usage. This continues to put significant pricing pressure on check printers. When financial institutions consolidate through mergers and acquisitions, often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other financial institution in the merger/acquisition. Financial institution mergers and acquisitions can also impact the duration of our contracts. Normally, the length of our supply contracts with financial institutions ranges from three to six years. However, contracts may be renegotiated or bought out mid-term due to a consolidation of financial institutions. Banks, especially larger ones, may request prepaid product discounts in the form of cash incentives payable at the beginning of a contract. These contract acquisition payments negatively impact check producers' cash flows at the beginning of these contracts. 

As a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry led to increases in bank failures and consolidations. To the extent financial institution failures and consolidations impact large portions of our customer base, this could have a significant impact on our financial institution check programs. 

Direct Mail Response Rates 

Direct Checks and portions of Small Business Services have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms and increasing use of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. We continually evaluate our marketing techniques in order to utilize the most effective and affordable advertising media. 

Competition 

The markets for small business services and supplies are highly fragmented and geographically dispersed, with many small local suppliers, large national retailers and internet-based providers. In these markets, the competitive factors influencing a customer's purchase decision are breadth and quality of product and service offerings, ease of use of web and other services, price, speed of delivery, convenience, the responsiveness and quality of customer support, and past experience with the supplier. Our primary competitors include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email and social media marketing services companies; media directory providers; and suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. We believe we are well-positioned in this competitive landscape through our broad customer base, the breadth of our small business product and service offerings, multiple distribution channels, established relationships with our financial institution and telecommunications clients and other partners, competitive prices, high quality and dependable service. 

In the check printing portion of the payments industry, we face considerable competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some retailers. We expect competition to remain intense as check usage continues to decline. Moreover, the check product must compete with alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative. The principal factors on which we compete are product and service breadth, price, quality and check merchandising program management. We believe the key items which differentiate us from our competition include our fully automated flat check delivery package, our online performance dashboard and portal analytics tools for financial institution branches, our personalized customer call center experience, and our Deluxe Business Advantage program, which 

provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses. In addition, Small Business Services offers an electronically-delivered check solution, Deluxe eChecks, to provide our small business customers with an online payment solution. 

At times, check suppliers have reduced the prices of their products during the supplier selection process in an attempt to gain greater volume. The corresponding pricing pressure has negatively impacted our profit margins. Pricing pressure will continue to impact our results of operations through lower pricing levels or client losses. Additionally, product discounts in the form of cash incentives payable to financial institutions upon contract execution are a common practice within the industry. Both the number of financial institution clients requesting these payments and the size of the payments has fluctuated in recent years. These up-front payments negatively impact check printers' cash flows at the beginning of the contracts. Our goal is to minimize the use of up-front product discounts by structuring new contracts with alternative incentives throughout the duration of the contract. 

Our Financial Services marketing solutions and other services offerings also face intense competition, including competition from financial institution core processors, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous financial technology services providers offering services such as core data processing solutions, customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, as well as rewards and loyalty solutions. We expect the intensity of competition to increase from established and emerging financial technology companies. The competitive factors affecting Financial Services marketing solutions and other services offerings include breadth and quality of services, ease of use, price, solution completeness, responsiveness and quality of customer support, as well as the ability to manage end-to-end financial institution processes. 

Seasonality 

We experience seasonal trends in sales of some of our products. For example, holiday card, retail packaging sales and rewards and loyalty solutions are typically stronger in the fourth quarter of the year due to the holiday season. Sales of tax forms are stronger in the first and fourth quarters of the year, and check sales for our Direct Checks segment have historically been stronger in the first quarter of the year. 

Materials, Supplies and Service Providers 

The principal materials used in producing our main products are paper, plastics, ink, cartons and printing plate material, which we purchase from various sources. We also purchase stock business forms and promotional apparel produced by third parties. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of materials from current or alternative suppliers. 

We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications and network server and transaction processing services. We believe we would be able to obtain an alternative source of supply if one or more of our service providers failed to perform. 

Governmental Regulation 

Portions of our business are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and other federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. In addition, some of our recently acquired businesses trigger compliance requirements under laws governing remote deposit capture, use of consumer report data, and payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses&#8217; customer information. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed data breach regulations may increase the costs of compliance for the protection of nonpublic personal information. The complexity of compliance with regulations, as well as the increased focus on cyber security, may also increase our cost of doing business. It may also affect our financial institution clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, possibly reducing the amount they spend on our products and services. 

Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, behavioral advertising and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Pending global data protection regulations may increase the costs of compliance in servicing international markets for our wholesale business services channels. Additionally, we could be impacted if laws are enacted related to the liability of online businesses for actions taken by their customers, including fraud, illegal content, spam, phishing, libel, defamation, and other abusive conduct. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, &#8220;anti-spam&#8221; regulations, or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites, and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Act") continues to increase the complexity of consumer protection rules for financial institutions and introduces more stringent regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions. It is likely that the Act has and will continue to have a negative impact on the profitability of our financial institution clients as they incur costs to comply with the new regulations. A report published in December 2015 by the United States Government Accountability Office indicated that the Act is negatively affecting the profitability of financial institutions, but its full impact remains uncertain because many of its rules have yet to be implemented and insufficient time has passed to evaluate others. Because of the additional costs, financial institutions may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, the Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) the authority to pursue financial institutions engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB&#8217;s rule-making and enforcement power may also extend to financial institutions&#8217; service providers. This has made some financial institutions wary of offering add-on services, such as fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued final rules mandated by the Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These rules require a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Accordingly, we implemented a reasonable country of origin inquiry program, which resulted in our disclosures relating to conflict minerals in May 2014 and May 2015. There are costs associated with complying with these rules and the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products could be adversely affected. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our products. 

At this time, we are not aware of any changes in these laws or regulations that will have a significant impact on our business during 2016. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Check designs exclusively licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average two to three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 5,341 employees in the United States, 514 employees in Canada and 19 employees in Europe. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we consider our employee relations to be good.

CODE OF ETHICS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES 

We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to all of our employees and our board of directors. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our investor relations website, Deluxe.com/investor, and also can be obtained free of charge upon written request to the attention of Investor Relations, Deluxe Corporation, P.O. Box 64235, St. Paul, Minnesota 55164-0235. Any changes or waivers of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct will be disclosed on our website. In addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of the Audit, Compensation, Corporate Governance and Finance Committees of our board of directors are available on our website or upon written request. 

One of the policies supporting our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct addresses political contributions. It is not our practice to make political contributions. We permit political contributions only upon written approval by our most senior management in their capacity as the corporate Compliance Committee under our ethics and compliance program. The Compliance Committee has not approved any such contributions. We are a member of various trade groups that represent the interests of specified industries. However, as a part of those memberships, we have not provided funds designated for political contributions.
