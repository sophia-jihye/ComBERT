This Annual Report on Form 10-K presents information for Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (&#8220;Holdings&#8221;). The terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;our company&#8221; as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to Sirius XM Radio Inc. (&#8220;Sirius XM&#8221;) and its subsidiaries.

Sirius XM Holdings Inc.

Sirius XM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdings. Holdings was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 21, 2013. Holdings has no operations independent of its subsidiary Sirius XM.

Relationship with Liberty Media

Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty Media") beneficially owns, directly and indirectly, over 50% of the outstanding shares of Holdings&#8217; common stock. Liberty Media owns interests in a range of media, communications and entertainment businesses. 

Sirius XM Radio Inc.

We transmit music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through our two proprietary satellite radio systems. Subscribers can also receive music and other channels, plus features such as SiriusXM On Demand and MySXM, over our Internet radio service, including through applications for mobile devices. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 29.6 million subscribers. Our subscribers include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

subscribers under our regular and discounted pricing plans; 

&#160;

&#183; 

subscribers that have prepaid, including payments made or due from automakers for subscriptions included in the sale or lease price of a vehicle; 

&#160;

&#183; 

subscribers to our Internet services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

certain subscribers to our weather, traffic and data services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions. 

Our primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of our customers subscribing on an annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly basis. We offer discounts for prepaid and longer term subscription plans as well as discounts for multiple subscriptions. We also derive revenue from the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, activation and other fees, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories, and other ancillary services, such as our weather, traffic and data services. 

Our satellite radios are primarily distributed through automakers; retail stores nationwide; and through our website. We have agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles. Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies. 

We are also a leader in providing connected vehicle applications and services. Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers. Subscribers to our connected vehicle services are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.

Programming

We offer a dynamic programming lineup of commercial-free music plus sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

an extensive selection of music genres, ranging from rock, pop and hip-hop to country, dance, jazz, Latin and classical; 

&#160;

&#183; 

live play-by-play sports from major leagues and colleges; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a multitude of talk and entertainment channels for a variety of audiences; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a wide range of national, international and financial news; 

&#160;

&#183; 

exclusive limited run channels; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

local traffic and weather reports for 21 metropolitan markets throughout the United States. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our diverse spectrum of programming, including our lineup of exclusive material, is a significant differentiator from terrestrial radio and other audio entertainment providers. We make changes to our programming lineup from time to time as we strive to attract new subscribers an d offer content which appeals to a broad range of audiences and to our existing subscribers. The channel line-ups for our services are available at siriusxm.com . 

Internet Radio Service

We stream select music and non-music channels over the Internet. Our Internet radio service also includes certain channels and features that are not available on our satellite radio service. Access to our Internet radio service is offered to subscribers for a fee. We also offer applications to allow consumers to access our Internet radio service on smartphones and tablet computers. 

SiriusXM Internet Radio offers listeners enhanced programming discovery and the ability to connect with content currently playing across our commercial-free music, sports, comedy, news, talk and entertainment channels or available through SiriusXM On Demand.

We offer two innovative Internet-based products, SiriusXM On Demand and MySXM. SiriusXM On Demand offers our Internet radio subscribers listening on our online media player and on smartphones the ability to choose their favorite episodes from a catalog of content whenever they want. MySXM permits subscribers to personalize our existing commercial-free music and comedy channels to create a more tailored listening experience. Channel-specific sliders allow users to create over 100 variations of each of more than 50 channels by adjusting characteristics like library depth, familiarity, music style, tempo, region, and multiple other channel-specific attributes. SiriusXM On Demand and MySXM are offered to our Internet radio subscribers at no extra charge. 

SXM17

We are developing a product, which we call &#8220;SXM17,&#8221; that combines our satellite and Internet services into a single, cohesive in-vehicle entertainment experience and is expected to allow us to take advantage of the automaker&#8217;s deployment of advanced in-dash infotainment systems. SXM17 will leverage the ubiquitous signal coverage of our satellite infrastructure and low delivery costs with the two-way communication capability of wireless Internet service to provide consumers seamless access to all of our content, including our live channels, SiriusXM On Demand programing and more personalized music services. The wireless Internet connection included in SXM17 will enable enhanced search and recommendations functions, making discovery of our content in the vehicle easier than ever. SXM17 will allow consumers to manage many aspects of their subscriptions directly through their vehicles&#8217; equipment. We expect automakers to begin including our SXM17 product in vehicles as early as 2017.

Distribution of Radios

Automakers

We distribute satellite radios through the sale and lease of new vehicles. We have agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles. Satellite radios are available as a factory or dealer-installed option in substantially all vehicle makes sold in the United States. 

Most automakers include a subscription to our radio service in the sale or lease of their new vehicles. In certain cases, we receive subscription payments from automakers in advance of the activation of our service. We share with certain automakers a portion of the revenues we derive from subscribers using vehicles equipped to receive our service. We also reimburse various automakers for certain costs associated with the satellite radios installed in new vehicles, including in certain cases hardware costs, engineering expenses and promotional and advertising expenses. 

Previously Owned Vehicles

We acquire subscribers through the sale and lease of previously owned vehicles with factory-installed satellite radios. We have entered into agreements with many automakers to market subscriptions to purchasers and lessees of vehicles which include satellite radios sold through their certified pre-owned programs. We also work directly with franchise and independent dealers on programs for non-certified vehicles. 

We have developed systems and methods to identify purchasers and lessees of previously owned vehicles which include satellite radios and have established marketing plans to promote our services to these potential subscribers. 

&#160;

&#160;

Retail 

We sell satellite radios directly to consumers through our website. Satellite radios are also marketed and distributed through national and regional retailers.

Our Satellite Radio Systems

Our satellite radio systems are designed to provide clear reception in most areas despite variations in terrain, buildings and other obstructions. We continually monitor our infrastructure and regularly evaluate improvements in technology.

Our satellite radio systems have three principal components:

&#160;

&#183; 

satellites, terrestrial repeaters and other satellite facilities; 

&#160;

&#183; 

studios; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

radios. 

Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities

Satellites. We provide our service through a fleet of eight orbiting satellites, five in the Sirius system, FM-1, FM-2, FM-3, FM-5 and FM-6, and three in the XM system, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5. 

Our constellation of three XM satellites operate in a geostationary, with XM-5 used as a spare for both the XM and Sirius constellations. Our constellation of five Sirius satellites operate in two separate orbits. Three of our Sirius satellites, FM-1, FM-2 and FM-3, operate in a highly inclined elliptical orbit. The other two Sirius satellites, FM-5 and FM-6, operate in a geostationary orbit. We plan to transition our Sirius constellation to solely a geostationary orbit using the FM-5 and FM-6 satellites. As part of this transition, FM-1, FM-2 and FM-3 are expected to be moved into disposal orbits during 2016. 

Satellite Insurance. We do not have in-orbit insurance policies covering our satellites, as we consider the premium costs to be uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure. 

Terrestrial Repeaters. In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from our satellites may be blocked and reception of satellite signals can be adversely affected. In many of these areas, we have deployed terrestrial repeaters to supplement satellite coverage. We operate over 1,100 terrestrial repeaters as part of our systems across the United States. 

Other Satellite Facilities. We control and communicate with our satellites from facilities in North America and maintain earth stations in Panama and Ecuador to control and communicate with three of our Sirius satellites, FM-1, FM-2 and FM-3. Our satellites are monitored, tracked and controlled by a third party satellite operator. 

Studios

Our programming originates from studios in New York City and Washington D.C. and, to a lesser extent, from smaller studios in Los Angeles, Nashville and a variety of smaller venues across the country. Our corporate headquarters is based in New York City. Both our New York City and Washington D.C. offices house facilities for programming origination, programming personnel and facilities to transmit programming.

Radios

Radios are primarily manufactured in two principal configurations - as in-dash radios and dock &#38; play radios. 

We do not manufacture radios. We have authorized manufacturers and distributors to produce and distribute radios, and have licensed our technology to various electronics manufacturers to develop, manufacture and distribute radios under certain brands. We do manage various aspects of the production of satellite radios. To facilitate the sale of radios, we may subsidize a portion of the radio manufacturing costs to reduce the hardware price to consumers.

&#160;

&#160;

Connected Vehicle Services 

We are a leader in providing connected vehicle services. Our connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers. We offer a portfolio of location-based services through two-way wireless connectivity, including safety, security, convenience, maintenance and data services, remote vehicles diagnostics, stolen or parked vehicle locator services, and monitoring of vehicle emission systems. Our connected vehicle business provides services to several automakers, including Acura, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Lexus, Nissan and Toyota.

Subscribers to our connected vehicle services are not included in our subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.

Canada

We own approximately 37% of the equity of Sirius XM Canada Holdings Inc. ("Sirius XM Canada"), the satellite radio provider in Canada. Subscribers to the services offered by Sirius XM Canada are not included in our subscriber count.

Other Services

Commercial Accounts. Our programming is available for commercial establishments. Commercial subscription accounts are available through providers of in-store entertainment solutions and directly from us. Certain commercial subscribers are included in our subscriber count. 

Satellite Television Service. Certain of our music channels are offered as part of certain programming packages on the DISH Network satellite television service. Subscribers to the DISH Network satellite television service are not included in our subscriber count. 

Subscribers to the following services are not included in our subscriber count, unless the applicable service is purchased by the subscriber separately and not as part of a radio subscription to our services:

Travel Link. We offer Travel Link, a suite of data services that includes graphical weather, fuel prices, sports schedules and scores and movie listings. 

Real-Time Traffic Services. We offer services that provide graphic information as to road closings, traffic flow and incident data to consumers with compatible in-vehicle navigation systems. 

Real-Time Weather Services. We offer several real-time weather services designed for improving situational awareness in vehicle, marine and/or aviation use. 

Competition

Satellite Radio

We face significant competition for both listeners and advertisers in our satellite radio business, including from providers of radio or other audio services. Our digital competitors are making in-roads into vehicles, where we are currently the prominent alternative to traditional AM/FM radio. 

Traditional AM/FM Radio. Our services compete with traditional AM/FM radio. Several traditional radio companies are substantial entities owning large numbers of radio stations or other media properties. The radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive. Traditional AM/FM broadcasters are also aggressively pursuing Internet radio, wireless Internet-based distribution arrangements and data services. 

Traditional AM/FM radio has a well-established demand for its services and offers free broadcasts paid for by commercial advertising rather than by subscription fees. Many radio stations offer information programming of a local nature, such as local news and sports. The availability of traditional free AM/FM radio reduces the likelihood that customers would be willing to pay for our subscription services and, by offering free broadcasts, it may impose limits on what we can charge for our services. 

Internet Radio and Internet-Enabled Smartphones. Internet radio services often have no geographic limitations and provide listeners with radio programming from across the country and around the world. Major media companies and online providers, including Apple, Google Play, Pandora and iHeartRadio, make high fidelity digital streams available through the Internet for free or, in some cases, for less than the cost of a satellite radio subscription. These services compete directly with our services, at home, in vehicles, and wherever audio entertainment is consumed. 

&#160;

&#160;

Smartphone applications are often free to the user and offer music and talk content. Leading audio smartphone radio applications include Apple, Pandora, Spotify, and iHeartRadio. Certain of these applications also include advanced functional ity, such as personalization, and allow the user to access large libraries of content. These services are easily integrated into vehicles. 

Advanced In-Dash Infotainment Systems. Nearly all automakers have deployed or are planning to deploy integrated multimedia systems in dashboards. These systems combine control of audio entertainment from a variety of sources, including AM/FM/HD radio broadcasts, satellite radio, Internet radio, smartphone applications and stored audio, with navigation and other advanced applications such as restaurant bookings, movie show times and financial information. Internet radio and other data are typically connected to the system via a bluetooth link to an Internet-enabled smartphone or wireless modem installed in the vehicle, and the entire system may be controlled by touchscreen or voice recognition. These systems enhance the attractiveness of Internet-based competitors by making such applications more prominent, easier to access, and safer to use in the car. Similar systems are also available in the aftermarket and sold through retailers. 

Direct Broadcast Satellite and Cable Audio. A number of providers offer specialized audio services through either direct broadcast satellite or cable audio systems. These services are targeted to fixed locations, mostly in-home. The radio service offered by direct broadcast satellite and cable audio is often included as part of a package of digital services with video service, and video customers generally do not pay an additional monthly charge for the audio service. 

Other Digital Media Services. The audio entertainment marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, with a steady emergence of new media platforms that compete with our services now or that could compete with those services in the future. 

Traffic News Services

A number of providers compete with our traffic news services. In-dash navigation is threatened by smartphones that provide data services through a direct vehicle interface. Most of these smartphones offer GPS mapping, often with turn-by-turn navigation.

Connected Vehicle Services

Our connected vehicle services business operates in a highly competitive environment and competes with several providers, including Verizon Telematics. OnStar, a division of General Motors, also offers connected vehicle services in GM vehicles. We also compete with wireless devices such as mobile phones, carriers of mobile communications and, to a lesser extent, with systems developed internally by automakers. We compete against other connected vehicle service providers for automaker arrangements on the basis of service quality and reliability, technical capabilities and systems customization, scope of service, industry experience, past performance and price.

Government Regulation

As operators of a privately-owned satellite system, we are regulated by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, principally with respect to:

&#160;

&#183; 

the licensing of our satellite systems; 

&#160;

&#183; 

preventing interference with or to other users of radio frequencies; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

compliance with FCC rules established specifically for U.S. satellites and satellite radio services. 

Any assignment or transfer of control of our FCC licenses must be approved by the FCC. The FCC's order approving the merger of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vernon Merger Corporation, with and into XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. in July 2008 (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) requires us to comply with certain voluntary commitments we made as part of the FCC Merger proceeding. We believe we comply with those commitments. 

In 1997, we were the winning bidders for FCC licenses to operate a satellite digital audio radio service and provide other ancillary services. Our FCC licenses for our Sirius satellites expire in 2017 and 2022. Our FCC licenses for our XM satellites expire in 2018, 2021 and 2022. XM-1 is operating under Special Temporary Authority from the FCC and is in the process of being de-orbited. We anticipate that, absent significant misconduct on our part, the FCC will renew our licenses to permit operation of our satellites for their useful lives, and grant licenses for any replacement satellites. 

In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from our satellites may be blocked and reception can be adversely affected. In many of these areas, we have installed terrestrial repeaters to supplement our satellite signal coverage. The FCC has established rules governing terrestrial repeaters and has granted us a license through 2027 to operate our repeater network. 

&#160;

&#160;

In many c ases, we obtain FCC certifications for satellite radios, including satellite radios that include FM modulators. We believe our radios that are in production comply with all applicable FCC rules. 

We are required to obtain export licenses from the United States government to export certain ground control equipment, satellite communications/control services and technical data related to our satellites and their operations. The delivery of such equipment, services and technical data to destinations outside the United States and to foreign persons is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements from the United States government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China). 

Changes in law or regulations relating to communications policy or to matters affecting our services could adversely affect our ability to retain our FCC licenses or the manner in which we operate. 

Copyrights to Programming

In connection with our satellite radio music programming, we must negotiate and enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders: Holders of copyrights in musical works (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of copyrights in sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work).

Musical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, have been traditionally represented by performing rights organizations such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (&#8220;ASCAP&#8221;), Broadcast Music, Inc. (&#8220;BMI&#8221;) and SESAC, Inc. (&#8220;SESAC&#8221;). These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders. We have arrangements with all of these organizations. However, the market for rights relating to musical works is changing rapidly. Certain songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations, particularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities have formed to represent rights holders. In addition, the United States Justice Department is reviewing the consent decrees that have governed ASCAP and BMI since the 1940s and other aspects of the musical works market. The changing market for musical works may have an adverse effect on us, including increasing our costs or limiting the musical works available to us.

Sound recording rights holders, typically large record companies, are primarily represented by SoundExchange, an organization which negotiates licenses, and collects and distributes royalties on behalf of record companies and performing artists. Under the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, we may negotiate royalty arrangements with the owners of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, or if negotiation is unsuccessful, the royalty rate is established by the Copyright Royalty Board (the &#8220;CRB&#8221;) of the Library of Congress. 

The CRB has issued its determination regarding the royalty rate payable by us under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 over our satellite digital audio radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, for the five-year period ending on December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the CRB's decision, we will pay a royalty based on gross revenues, subject to certain exclusions, of 10.5% for 2016 and 11% for 2017. The rate for 2015 was 10%.

The revenue subject to royalty includes subscription revenue from our U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers and advertising revenue from channels, other than those channels that make only incidental performances of sound recordings. Exclusions from revenue subject to the statutory license fee include, among other things, revenue from channels, programming and products or other services offered for a separate charge where such channels make only incidental performances of sound recordings; revenue from equipment sales; revenue from current and future data services (including video and connected vehicle services) offered for a separate charge; intellectual property royalties received by us; credit card, invoice and fulfillment service fees; and bad debt expense. The regulations also allow us to further reduce our monthly royalty fee in proportion to the percentage of our performances that feature pre-1972 recordings (which are not subject to federal copyright protection) as well as those that are licensed directly from the copyright holder, rather than through the statutory license. 

To secure the rights to stream music content over the Internet, including to mobile devices, we also must obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, copyright owners of musical compositions and sound recordings. We have arrangements with ASCAP, SESAC and BMI to license the musical compositions we stream over the Internet. The licensing of certain sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 for use on the Internet is also subject to the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 on terms established by the CRB. In 2015, we paid a per performance rate for the streaming of certain sound recordings on the Internet of $0.0024. 

&#160;

&#160;

In December 2015, the CRB released the rates and terms for the use of sound recordings by non-interactive Internet services, such as our Internet radio service, for the period of 2016 through 2020. Effective as of January 1, 2016, the CRB set a royalty rate at $0.0017 per performance for ad-supported services and a roya lty rate at $0.0022 p er performance for subscription- based services. In accordance with the CRB&#8217;s decision, these royalty rates will increase during the period from 2017 through 2020 based on the consumer price index. 

Our rights to perform certain copyrighted sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work) that were fixed after February 15, 1972 are governed by United States federal law, the Copyright Act. In contrast, our rights to perform certain sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 are governed by state statutes and common law and are subject to litigation in five States. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" below.

Trademarks

We have registered, and intend to maintain, the trademarks &#8220;Sirius&#8221;, &#8220;XM&#8221;, &#8220;SiriusXM&#8221; and &#8220;SXM&#8221; with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the services we offer. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use the &#8220;Sirius&#8221;, &#8220;XM&#8221;, &#8220;SiriusXM&#8221; or "SXM&#8221; trademarks in the United States. We also have registered, and intend to maintain, trademarks for the names of certain of our channels. We have also registered the trademarks &#8220;Sirius&#8221;, &#8220;XM&#8221; and "SiriusXM" in Canada. We have granted a license to use certain of our trademarks in Canada to Sirius XM Canada.

Personnel

As of December 31, 2015, we had 2,323 full-time employees. In addition, we rely upon a number of part-time employees, consultants, other advisors and outsourced relationships. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
