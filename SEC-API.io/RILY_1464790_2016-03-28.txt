&#167; Great American Group Advisory and Valuation Services, LLC, a leading provider of appraisal and valuation services for asset based lenders, private equity firms and corporate clients. &#160;

We are headquartered in Los Angeles with offices in major financial markets throughout the United States and Europe.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

For financial reporting purposes we classify our businesses into three segments: (i) capital markets, (ii) auction and liquidation and (iii) valuation and appraisal.

&#160;

&#160;

Capital Markets Segment . Our capital markets segment provides a full array of investment banking, corporate finance, research, wealth management, sales and trading services to corporate, institutional and high net worth clients. Our corporate finance and investment banking services include merger and acquisitions advisory services to public and private companies, initial and secondary public offerings, and institutional private placements. In addition, we trade equity securities as a principal for the Company&#8217;s account, including investments in funds managed by our subsidiaries. Our capital markets segment also includes our asset management businesses that manage various private and public funds for institutional and individual investors.

&#160;

&#160; Auction and Liquidation Segment. Our auction and liquidation segment utilizes our significant industry experience, a scalable network of independent contractors and industry-specific advisors to tailor our services to the specific needs of a multitude of clients, logistical challenges and distressed circumstances. Furthermore, our scale and pool of resources allow us to offer our services across North American as well as parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. Our auction and liquidation segment operates through two main divisions, retail store liquidations and wholesale and industrial assets dispositions. Our wholesale and industrial assets disposition division operates through limited liability companies that are controlled by us.

&#160;

&#160; Valuation and Appraisal Segment. Our valuation and appraisal segment provides valuation and appraisal services to financial institutions, lenders, private equity firms and other providers of capital. These services primarily include the valuation of assets (i) for purposes of determining and monitoring the value of collateral securing financial transactions and loan arrangements and (ii) in connection with potential business combinations. Our valuation and appraisal segment operates through limited liability companies that are majority owned by us.

&#160; 

Private Placement and Strategic Combination 

&#160;

On June 5, 2014, we completed a private placement of 10,289,300 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $5.00 per share (the &#8220;Private Placement&#8221;). Fifty-three accredited investors (the &#8220;Investors&#8221;) participated in the Private Placement pursuant to the terms and provisions of a securities purchase agreement entered into among us and the Investors on May 19, 2014. At the closing of the Private Placement on June 5, 2014, we received net proceeds of approximately $51.2 million. On June 5, 2014, we used $30.2 million of the net proceeds from the Private Placement to repay long-term debt payable to Andrew Gumaer and Harvey Yellen, both of whom were executive officers and directors of the Company at the time of such repayment. The $30.0 million principal payment and then outstanding accrued interest of $0.2 million retired the entire $48.8 million face amount of the long-term debt at a discount of $18.8 million. The discount of $18.8 million has been recorded as a capital contribution to additional paid in capital in our consolidated financial statements.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On June 18, 2014, we completed the acquisition of B. Riley and Co. Inc. (&#8220;BRC Inc.&#8221;) pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement (the Acquisition Agreement&#8221;), dated as of May 19, 2014, by and among the Company, Darwin Merger Sub I, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, B. Riley Capital Markets, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;BCM&#8221;), BRC Inc., B. Riley &#38; Co. Holdings, LLC (&#8220;BRH&#8221;), Riley Investment Management LLC (&#8220;RIM&#8221;), and collectively with BRC Inc. and BRH, the (&#8220;B. Riley Entities&#8221;) and Bryant Riley, a director of the Company and principal owner of each of the B. Riley Entities. In connection with the Company&#8217;s acquisition of BRC Inc., Darwin Merger Sub I, Inc. merged with and into BRC Inc., and BRC Inc. subsequently merged with and into BCM, with BCM surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We completed the acquisitions of BRH, whose operations include asset management and financial advisory services, and RIM, which provides services to certain pooled investment vehicles, on August 1, 2014.

&#160;

The total purchase price for the B. Riley Entities was $26.4 million, which was paid at closing on June 18, 2014, or through post-closing adjustments and arrangements, in the form of 4,182,637 newly issued shares of our common stock. The fair value of the newly issued shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock for accounting purposes was determined based on the closing market price of the Company&#8217;s shares of common stock on the acquisition date, less a 25% discount for lack of marketability as the shares issued are subject to certain restrictions that limit their trade or transfer in the open market.

&#160;

Effective upon the closing of the acquisition on June 18, 2014, Bryant Riley, the principal owner of BRC Inc., was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. As a result of the acquisition of BRC Inc., Bryant Riley owns approximately 24.1% of our outstanding common stock.

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160;

On January 2, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire all of the membership interests of MK Capital Advisors, LLC (&#8220;MK Capital&#8221;) , a wealth management business with operations primarily in New York. On February 2, 2015, the pre-closing conditions were satisfied and we completed the purchase of MK Capital. Upon closing, we paid the members of MK Capital $2.5 million in cash and issued 333,333 shares of our common stock to such members. The purchase agreement also requires the payment of contingent consideration of $1.25 million in cash and 166,667 shares of our common stock on the first anniversary date of the closing (February 2, 2016) and a final payment of $1.25 million in cash and 166,666 of our common stock on the second anniversary date of the closing (February 2, 2017). Such contingent consideration is contingent on MK Capital generating a minimum amount of gross revenues as defined in the purchase agreement for the twelve months ending on the first and second anniversary dates of the closing. MK Capital achieved the minimum amount of revenues for the first anniversary period and t he contingent cash consideration and contingent stock consideration for such first anniversary period was paid and issued on February 2, 2016. The acquisition of MK Capital allows the Company to expand into the wealth management business..

&#160;

In April 2015, we announced the formation of GACP, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and GACP I, L.P., a private direct lending fund of which GACP is the general partner, together with an anchor investment from a business development company advised by a large financial services company. GACP I, L.P. provides asset-based loans to middle market companies. GACP leverages the knowledge and expertise of Great American Group&#8217;s liquidation and appraisal business to provide insight into asset collateral values that support the asset-based loans. We believe that this internal expertise in assessing collateral values provides GACP with a competitive advantage over other middle market direct lenders. In connection with the formation of GACP I, L.P., we committed to invest $5.0 million in exchange for an ownership interest of approximately 5% of GACP I, L.P. As of December 31, 2015, we funded $1.7 million of the $5.0 million commitment to invest in GACP I, L.P.

&#160;

In February 2016, we announced the hiring of a senior managing director to form and head our corporate restructuring practice group. Our new senior managing director brings extensive experience in the retail, healthcare, real estate, energy, and communications sectors and has advised municipalities and other governmental entities. He was named the 2014 &#34;Turnaround Consultant of the Year&#34; by The M&#38;A Advisor and a Top 100 Global Restructuring and Turnaround Professional by Global M&#38;A Network.

&#160; 

Sales, Trading and Corporate Services 

&#160;

Our sales and trading professionals distribute B. Riley proprietary research products to our institutional investor clients and high net worth individuals. B. Riley sales and trading also sells the securities of companies in which B. Riley acts as an underwriter and executes equity trades on behalf of clients. We maintain active trading relationships with substantially all major institutional money managers. Our equity and fixed income traders make markets in approximately 150 securities. Our corporate services include retail orders, block trades, Rule 144 transactions, cashless exercise of options, and corporate equity repurchase programs. &#160; 

&#160; 

Equity Research 

&#160;

Our equity research is focused on fundamentals-based research. Our research focuses on an in-depth analysis of earnings, cash flow trends, balance sheet strength, industry outlook, and strength of management that involves extensive meetings with key management, competitors, channel partners and customers. We provide research on all sizes of firms; however, our research primarily focuses on small and mid-cap stocks that are under-followed by Wall Street. Our analysts regularly communicate their findings through Research Updates and daily Morning Notes.

&#160;

Our research department includes research analysts maintaining coverage on a variety of companies in a variety of industry sectors. Our research department annually organizes non-deal road shows for issuers in our targeted industries. To provide our institutional clients access to management teams of companies in our coverage universe and others, our research department has held 16 consecutive annual institutional investor conferences.

&#160; 

Capital Management 

&#160;

We provide investment management services under our subsidiary, B. Riley Capital Management, LLC, an SEC registered investment advisor. The registered investment advisor manages one mutual fund and certain other private investment funds, including a fund of funds. All of the funds managed typically invest in both public and private equity and debt. Investors for the various funds include institutional, high net worth, and individual investors. GACP is the general partner of GACP I, L.P., a direct lending fund that provides asset based loans to middle market companies.

&#160; 

Wealth Management 

&#160;

In February 2015, we acquired MK Capital, a wealth management business with operations primarily in New York, and subsequently changed the name to &#8220;B. Riley Wealth Management&#8221;. Our wealth management business provides comprehensive investment advisory services to ultrahigh net worth families and individuals. We provide traditional asset management, alternative asset management and trust and estate planning to our clients. B. Riley Wealth Management is a division of B. Riley Capital Management, LLC, an SEC registered investment advisor.

&#160; 

Proprietary Trading 

&#160;

We engage in trading activities for strategic investment purposes (i.e proprietary trading) utilizing the firm&#8217;s capital. Proprietary trading activities include investments in public and private stock and debt securities. In 2010, the federal government passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank&#8221;). Dodd-Frank significantly restructures and intensifies regulation in the financial services industry and includes a section referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;. The Volcker Rule provides for a limitation on proprietary trading and investments by certain bank holding companies. We are not a bank holding company and, as a result, the limitations applicable to bank holding companies regarding proprietary trading and investment in the Volcker Rule do not apply to us.

&#160;

The business described above for B. Riley is reported in our capital markets segment for financial reporting purposes.

&#160;

&#160; 

Great American Group 

&#160; 

Retail Store Liquidations 

&#160;

We enable our clients to quickly and efficiently dispose of under-performing assets and generate cash from excess inventory by conducting or assisting in retail store closings, going out of business sales, bankruptcy sales and fixture sales. With the goal of providing a single-source solution to our retail clients, we also provide merger and acquisition due diligence through our auction and liquidation segment and reverse logistics and appraisal services through our valuation and appraisal segment. Financial institution and other capital providers rely on us to maximize recovery rates in distressed asset sales and in retail bankruptcy situations. Additionally, healthy, mature retailers utilize our proven inventory management and strategic disposition solutions, relying on our extensive network of retail professionals, to close unproductive stores and dispose of surplus inventory and fixtures as existing stores are updated. For example, in a potential bankruptcy engagement, the debtor provides potential disposition firms with a snapshot of inventory and other assets available for sale. The disposition firms must analyze the inventory data and generate an estimate of potential recovery based on their valuation expertise and past liquidation experience. The disposition firms then submit bids that guarantee a minimum recovery based on a percentage of retail value or cost. The successful bidder assumes management of the debtor&#8217;s stores on a contract basis and conducts the orderly disposition of the inventory and assets in these stores. Profits are generated by efficiently merchandizing inventory, managing the orderly closing of store locations and pricing remaining products to balance margin with speed of sale and liquidation expenses. Unlike merchandisers who employ a &#8220;top down&#8221; approach by focusing only on driving total sales (because overhead costs are fixed), disposition firms take a &#8220;bottom up&#8221; approach by focusing on balancing cost savings with maximizing proceeds. A typical retail disposition process spans eight to twelve weeks from the bankruptcy court&#8217;s approval of the successful bid to the final store closure.

&#160;

We often conduct large retail liquidations that entail significant capital requirements through collaborative arrangements with other liquidators. By entering into an agreement with one or more collaborators, we are able to bid on larger engagements that we couldn&#8217;t conduct on our own due to the significant capital outlay involved, number of independent contractors required or financial risk associated with the particular engagement. We act as the lead partner in many of the collaborative arrangements that we enter into, meaning that we have primary responsibility for the due diligence, contract negotiation and execution of the engagement.

&#160; 

Wholesale and Industrial Asset Dispositions 

&#160;

We design and implement customized disposition programs for our clients seeking to convert excess wholesale and industrial inventory and operational assets into capital. We dispose of a wide array of assets including, among others, equipment related to transportation, heavy mobile construction, energy exploration and services, metal fabrication, food processing, semiconductor fabrication, and distribution services. We manage projects of all sizes and scopes across a variety of asset categories. We believe that our databases of information regarding potential buyers that we have collected from past transactions and engagements, our nationwide name recognition and experience with alternative distribution channels allow us to provide superior wholesale and industrial disposition services.

&#160;

We offer clients various wholesale and industrial disposition strategies including, among others, live auctions, webcast auctions, and online auctions. The live public auction is the most traditional sales technique for wholesale and industrial asset dispositions and one of our most frequently utilized services. In live auctions, bidders gather at a specified date and time to competitively bid against one another, with each item selling to the highest bidder. We believe that our auctioneers are recognized throughout the industry for their auctioneering skills, project experience, engaging personalities and ability to extract top prices. Our live auctions can cover single sites or multiple locations, and we utilize point-of-sale software to generate customized sales reports and invoices and to track assets. Increasingly, we have been webcasting our live auctions over the Internet. This auction format allows online bidders to compete in real time against bidders at the live auction. Bidders can log onto the auction from personal computers, view and bid on lots as they come up for sale, hear the auctioneers as the sale is being conducted and, in some cases, view live streaming video of the auctioneer calling the bids on-site. We believe that this auction format maximizes proceeds by providing access to otherwise unavailable potential bidders, including international participants, thereby increasing competition. In some cases, particularly when assets are located in remote areas that are not easily accessible to bidders, we may determine, in consultation with the client, that a webcast only auction is the most appropriate format. In the online auction format, the sale of assets takes place exclusively online, without a live auctioneer calling the sale. Similar to the timed auctions popularized by online auction sites such as eBay, assets are posted for sale online and buyers can bid on lots and items for a set period of time, usually one week. The online auction format is optimal for clients that have idle assets in quantities insufficient to justify the cost of a live auction. We conduct our wholesale and industrial disposition business throughout parts of North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Our business is primarily conducted through GA Global Partners, LLC, a 50% owned subsidiary that is controlled by us.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Great American Group provides the foregoing services to clients on a guarantee, fee or outright purchase basis.

&#160; 

Guarantee . When providing services on a guarantee basis, we guarantee the client a specific recovery often expressed as a percentage of retail inventory value or wholesale inventory cost or, in the case of machinery or equipment, a set dollar amount. This guarantee is often required to be supported by a letter of credit, a cash deposit or a combination thereof. Cash deposits are typically funded in part with available cash together with short term borrowings under our credit facilities. Often when we provide auction or liquidation services on a guarantee basis, we do so through a collaborative arrangement with other service providers. In this situation, each collaborator agrees to provide a certain percentage of the guaranteed amount to the client through a combination of letters of credit, cash and financing. If we are engaged individually, we receive 100% of the net profit, less debt financing fees, sale related expenses (if any) and any share of the profits due to the client as a result of any profit sharing arrangement entered into based on a pre-negotiated formula. If the engagement was conducted through a collaborative arrangement, the profits or losses are divided among us and our partner or partners as set forth in the agreement governing the collaborative arrangement. If the net sales proceeds after expenses are less than the guarantee, we, together with our partners if the engagement was conducted through a collaborative arrangement, are responsible for the shortfall and will recognize a loss on the engagement. 

&#160; 

Fee. When we provide services on a fee basis, clients pay a pre-negotiated flat fee for the services provided, a percentage of asset sales generated or a combination of both.

&#160; 

Outright Purchase. When providing services on an outright purchase basis, we purchase the assets from the client and typically sell them at auction, orderly liquidation, through a third-party broker or, less frequently, as augmented inventory in conjunction with another liquidation that we are conducting. In an outright purchase, we take, together with any collaboration partners, title to the assets and absorb the profit or loss associated with the asset disposition.

&#160;

The retail store liquidations and wholesale and industrial asset dispositions business of Great American Group described above is reported in our auction and liquidation segment for financial reporting purposes.

&#160; 

Valuation and Appraisal 

&#160;

Our valuation and appraisal teams provide independent appraisals to financial institutions, lenders, private equity firms and other providers of capital for estimated liquidation values of assets. These teams include experts specializing in particular industry niches and asset classes. We provide valuation and appraisal services across five general categories:

&#160; 

Consumer and Retail Inventory . Representative types of appraisals and valuations include inventory of specialty apparel retailers, department stores, jewelry retailers, sporting goods retailers, mass and discount merchants, home furnishing retailers and footwear retailers.

&#160; 

Wholesale and Industrial Inventory . Representative types of appraisals and valuations include inventory held by manufacturers or distributors of automotive parts, chemicals, food and beverage products, wine and spirits, building and construction products, industrial products, metals, paper and packaging.

&#160; 

Machinery and Equipment . Representative types of asset appraisals and valuations include a broad range of equipment utilized in manufacturing, construction, transportation and healthcare.

&#160; 

Intangible Assets . Representative types of asset appraisals and valuations include intellectual property, goodwill, brands, logos, trademarks and customer lists.

&#160; 

Real Estate . Representative types of asset appraisals and valuations include owned and leased manufacturing and distribution facilities, retail locations and corporate offices. We do not perform appraisals of residential properties.

&#160;

We provide valuation and appraisal services on a pre-negotiated flat fee basis.

The valuation and appraisal services business of Great American Group described above is reported in our valuation and appraisal segment for financial reporting purposes.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

UK Retail Stores 

&#160;

We previously had an additional operating segment relating to UK retail stores. Our UK retail stores segment included the operations of ten retail footwear stores in the United Kingdom as a result of our investment in Shoon Trading Limited (&#8220;Shoon&#8221;) on May 4, 2012. We ceased to consider this a separate operating segment in August 2013 following the amendment and restatement of a shareholders agreement for Shoon which eliminated our control rights. As a result of this amendment, Shoon&#8217;s operating results are not consolidated with the Company&#8217;s for any periods after July 31, 2013. Notwithstanding the deconsolidation, our operating results for periods from July 31, 2013 to January 2014 include the income (loss) from our 44.4% equity investment in the common stock of Shoon. In January 2014, Shoon was sold to a third party, and we no longer have a financial interest in the operations of Shoon.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

We serve retail, corporate, capital provider and individual customers across our services lines. Revenues from liquidation service contracts to one retailer represented 12.4% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues from one liquidation service contract and the sale of four oil rigs to one customer represented 10.7% and 12.2% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013. The services provided to these customers were under short-term liquidation contracts that generally do not exceed a period of six months. There were no recurring revenues from year-to-year in connection with the services we performed under these contracts.

&#160;

We also provide corporate finance, research, wealth management, and sales and trading services to high net worth individuals.

&#160;

We maintain ongoing client relationships with major asset based lenders including Bank of America, Credit Suisse, GE Capital, JPMorgan Chase, Union Bank of California, and Wells Fargo. Our clients also include private equity firms such as Apollo Management, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, and Sun Capital Partners.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

B. Riley 

&#160;

We face intense competition for our capital markets services. Since the mid-1990s, there has been substantial consolidation among U.S. and global financial institutions. In particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other diversified financial services firms have merged with other financial institutions or have established or acquired broker-dealers. During 2008, the failure or near-collapse of a number of very large financial institutions led to the acquisition of several of the most sizeable U.S. investment banking firms, consolidating the financial industry to an even greater extent. Currently, our competitors are other investment banks, bank holding companies, brokerage firms, merchant banks and financial advisory firms. Our focus on our target industries also subjects us to direct competition from a number of specialty securities firms and smaller investment banking boutiques that specialize in providing services to these industries. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The industry trend toward consolidation has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of many of our competitors. Our larger and better-capitalized competitors may be better able than we are to respond to changes in the investment banking industry, to recruit and retain skilled professionals, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share generally. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we do, including loans, deposit-taking and insurance, in addition to brokerage, asset management and investment banking services, all of which may enhance their competitive position relative to us. These firms also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which could result in downward pricing pressure in our businesses. In particular, the trend in the equity underwriting business toward multiple book runners and co-managers has increased the competitive pressure in the investment banking industry and has placed downward pressure on average transaction fees. 

&#160;

As we seek to expand our asset management business, we face competition in the pursuit of investors for our investment funds, in the identification and completion of investments in attractive portfolio companies or securities, and in the recruitment and retention of skilled asset management professionals.

&#160; 

Great American Group 

&#160;

We also face intense competition in our other service areas. While some competitors are unique to specific service offerings, some competitors cross multiple service offerings. A number of companies provide services or products to the auction and liquidation and valuation and appraisal markets, and existing and potential clients can, or will be able to, choose from a variety of qualified service providers. Some of our competitors may even be able to offer discounts or other preferred pricing arrangements. In a cost-sensitive environment, such arrangements may prevent us from acquiring new clients or new engagements with existing clients. Some of our competitors may be able to negotiate secure alliances with clients and affiliates on more favorable terms, devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns or to the development of technology systems than us. In addition, new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies with respect to the online auction business may increase the competitive pressures on us. We must also compete for the services of skilled professionals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures we face could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. &#160; 

&#160;

We face competition for our retail services from traditional liquidators as well as Internet-based liquidators such as overstock.com and eBay. Our wholesale and industrial services competitors include traditional auctioneers and fixed site auction houses that may specialize in particular industries or geographic regions as well as other large, prestigious or well-recognized auctioneers. We also face competition and pricing pressure from the internal remarketing groups of our clients and potential clients and from companies that may choose to liquidate or auction assets and/or excess inventory without assistance from service providers like us. We face competition for our valuation and appraisal services from large accounting, consulting and other professional service firms as well as other valuation, appraisal and advisory firms.

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. In addition, numerous states and municipalities regulate the conduct of auctions and the liability of auctioneers. We and/or our auctioneers are licensed or bonded in the following states where we conduct, or have conducted, retail, wholesale or industrial asset auctions: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington. In addition, we are licensed or obtain permits in cities and/or counties where we conduct auctions, as required. If we conduct an auction in a state where we are not licensed or where reciprocity laws do not exist, we will work with an auctioneer of record in such state.

&#160;

As a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject to complex and extensive regulation of most aspects of our business by U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations and securities exchanges. The laws, rules and regulations comprising the regulatory framework are constantly changing, as are the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations. The effect of any such changes cannot be predicted and may direct the manner of our operations and affect our profitability.

&#160;

BRC, our broker-dealer subsidiary, is subject to regulations governing every aspect of the securities business, including the execution of securities transactions; capital requirements; record-keeping and reporting procedures; relationships with customers, including the handling of cash and margin accounts; the experience of and training requirements for certain employees; and business interactions with firms that are not members of regulatory bodies.

&#160;

BRC is registered as a securities broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of FINRA. FINRA is a self-regulatory body composed of members such as our broker-dealer subsidiary that have agreed to abide by the rules and regulations of FINRA. FINRA may expel, fine and otherwise discipline member firms and their employees. BRC is also licensed as a broker-dealer in 18 states in the U.S., requiring us to comply with the laws, rules and regulations of each such state. Each state may revoke the license to conduct securities business, fine and otherwise discipline broker-dealers and their employees. We are also registered with NASDAQ and must comply with its applicable rules.

&#160;

&#160;

BRC is also subject to the SEC&#8217;s Uniform Net Capital Rule, Rule 15c3-1, which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our broker-dealer subsidiary. The Uniform Net Capital Rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid. In addition, BRC is subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital.

&#160;

We are also subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act), which imposes obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence and customer verification, and other compliance policies and procedures. The conduct of research analysts is also the subject of rule-making by the SEC, FINRA and the federal government through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These regulations require certain disclosures by, and restrict the activities of, research analysts and broker-dealers, among others. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in the case of the USA Patriot Act, criminal penalties.

Our asset management subsidiary, B. Riley Capital Management, LLC is an SEC-registered investment adviser, and accordingly subject to regulation by the SEC. Requirements under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 include record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, and prohibitions on fraudulent activities.

&#160;

Various regulators, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators and attorneys general, are conducting both targeted and industry-wide investigations of certain practices relating to the financial services industry, including marketing, sales practices, valuation practices, asset managers, and market and compensation arrangements. These investigations, which have been highly publicized, have involved mutual fund companies, broker-dealers, hedge funds, investors and others.

&#160;

In addition, the SEC staff has conducted studies with respect to soft dollar practices in the brokerage and asset management industries and proposed interpretive guidance regarding the scope of permitted brokerage and research services in connection with soft dollar practices.

&#160;

In July 2010, Congress enacted Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank institutes a wide range of reforms that will impact financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. In addition, the legislation mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. Many of the provisions of Dodd-Frank are subject to further rulemaking procedures and studies and will take effect over several years. As a result, we cannot assess the impact of these new legislative and regulatory changes on our business at the present time.

We rely significantly on the expertise of independent contractors whom we engage in connection with specific transactions. As of December 31, 2015, we maintained a network of approximately 160 independent contractors who we engage from time to time to provide services pursuant to the terms of independent contractor agreements.

Other 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Delaware in May 2009 as a subsidiary of Alternative Asset Management Acquisition Corp. (&#8220;AAMAC&#8221;). On July 31, 2009, we closed a transaction pursuant to which (i) the members of Great American Group, LLC contributed to the Company of all of their membership interests in Great American Group, LLC, and (ii) AAMAC merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result of such transactions, Great American Group, LLC and AAMAC became our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Following the acquisition of BRC Inc., we changed the Company&#8217;s name from Great American Group, Inc. to B. Riley Financial, Inc. in November 2014.
