History and Development of Seneca Foods Corporation

SENECA FOODS CORPORATION (the "Company") is North America's leading provider of packaged fruits and vegetables with facilities located throughout the United States. The Company's product offerings include canned, frozen and bottled produce and snack chips and its products are sold under private label as well as national and regional brands that the Company owns or licenses, including Seneca&#174;, Libby's&#174;, Green Valley&#174;, Aunt Nellie's&#174;, READ&#174;, Cherryman&#174; and Seneca Farms&#174;. The Company packs Green Giant, Le Sueur and other brands of canned vegetables as well as select Green Giant frozen vegetables for B&#38;G Foods North America ("B&#38;G") under a contract packing agreement.

As of March 31, 2016, the Company's facilities consisted of 23 packaging plants strategically located throughout the United States, three can manufacturing plants, two seed packaging operations, a farming operation and a logistical support network. The Company also maintains warehouses which are generally located adjacent to its packaging plants. The Company is a New York corporation and its headquarters is located at 3736 South Main Street, Marion, New York and its telephone number is (315) 926-8100.

The Company was founded in 1949 and during its 67 years of operation, the Company has made over 50 strategic acquisitions including the purchase of the long-term license for the Libby's brand in 1983, the purchase of General Mills' Green Giant packaging assets and entry into an Alliance Agreement with General Mills Operations, LLC ("GMOL") in 1995 and the acquisition of Chiquita Processed Foods in 2003. The Company believes that these acquisitions have enhanced the Company's leadership position in the private label and foodservice canned vegetable markets in the United States and significantly increased its international sales. In August 2006, the Company acquired Signature Fruit Company, LLC, a leading producer of canned fruits located in Modesto, California. This acquisition allowed the Company to broaden its product offerings to become a leading producer and distributor of canned fruit and to achieve cost advantages through the realization of distribution and other synergies with the Company's canned vegetable business. In 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the membership interest in Independent Foods, LLC. In April 2014, the Company purchased a 50% equity interest in Truitt Bros. Inc. In 2016, the Company acquired Gray &#38; Company and Diana Foods Co., Inc., each leading providers of maraschino cherries and other cherry products. The plants acquired are in Hart, Michigan and Dayton, Oregon. The rationale for these acquisitions was twofold: (1) the businesses are a complementary fit with the Company's existing business and (2) it provides an extension of the Company's product offerings.

The Company manages its business on the basis of two reportable segments &#8211; the primary segment is the packaging and sale of fruits and vegetables and the secondary segment is the packaging and sale of chip products. These two segments constitute the food operation. The food operation constitutes 98% of total sales, of which approximately 68% is canned vegetable packaging, 20% is canned fruit packaging, 11% is frozen fruit and vegetable packaging and 1% is fruit chip packaging. The non-food operation, which is primarily related to the sale of cans and ends and outside revenue generated from our trucking and aircraft operations, represents 2% of the Company's total sales.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 

The Company's food packaging plants are located in major vegetable producing states and in four fruit producing states. Fruits and vegetables are primarily obtained through supply contracts with independent growers.

Intellectual Property 

The Company's most significant brand name, Libby's &#174; , is held pursuant to a trademark license granted to the Company in March 1982 and renewable by the Company every 10 years for an aggregate period expiring in March 2081. The original licensor was Libby, McNeill &#38; Libby, Inc., then an indirect subsidiary of Nestl&#233;, S. A. ("Nestl&#233;") and the license was granted in connection with the Company's purchase of certain of the licensor's canned vegetable operations in the United States. Corlib Brands Management, LTD acquired the license from Nestl&#233; during 2006. The license is limited to vegetables which are shelf-stable, frozen, and thermally packaged, and includes the Company's major vegetable varieties &#8211; corn, peas and green beans &#8211; as well as certain other thermally packaged vegetable varieties and sauerkraut.

The Company is required to pay an annual royalty and Corlib Brands now known as Libby's Brand Holding, Ltd., which may terminate the license for non-payment of royalty, use of the trademark in sales outside the licensed territory, failure to achieve a minimum level of sales under the licensed trademark during any calendar year or a material breach or default by the Company under the agreement (which is not cured within the specified cure period). With the purchase of Signature Fruit Company, LLC, which also uses the Libby's &#174; brand name, the Company re-negotiated the license agreement and created a new, combined agreement based on Libby's &#174; revenue dollars for fruits, vegetables, and dry beans. A total of $327,000 was paid as a royalty fee for the year ended March 31, 2016.

The Company also sells canned fruits and vegetables, frozen vegetables and other food products under several other brands for which the Company has obtained registered trademarks, including, Aunt Nellie's &#174; , Cherryman &#174; , READ &#174; , Seneca Farms &#174; , and Seneca &#174; and other regional brands.

Seasonal Business 

While individual fruits and vegetables have seasonal cycles of peak production and sales, the different cycles are somewhat offsetting. Minimal food packaging occurs in the Company's last fiscal quarter ending March 31, which is the optimal time for maintenance, repairs and equipment changes in its packaging plants. The supply of commodities, current pricing, and expected new crop quantity and quality affect the timing and amount of the Company's sales and earnings. When the seasonal harvesting periods of the Company's major fruits and vegetables are newly completed, inventories for these packaged fruits and vegetables are at their highest levels. For peas, the peak inventory time is mid-summer and for corn, the Company's highest volume vegetable, the peak inventory is in mid-autumn. For peaches, the Company's highest volume fruit, the peak inventory time is early-autumn. For pears, the peak inventory is late-summer. For cherries, the peak inventory is late-summer.

These seasonal fluctuations are illustrated in the following table, which presents certain unaudited quarterly financial information for the periods indicated:

Backlog 

In the food packaging business, an end of year sales order backlog is not considered meaningful. Traditionally, larger customers provide tentative bookings for their expected purchases for the upcoming season. These bookings are further developed as data on the expected size of the related national harvests becomes available. In general, these bookings serve as a yardstick rather than as a firm commitment, since actual harvest results can vary notably from early estimates. In actual practice, the Company has substantially all of its expected seasonal production identified to potential sales outlets before the seasonal production is completed.

Competition and Customers 

Competition in the food business is substantial with brand recognition and promotion, quality, service, and pricing being the major determinants in the Company's relative market position. The Company believes that it is a major producer of canned fruits and vegetables, but some producers of canned, frozen and other forms of fruit and vegetable products have sales which exceed the Company's sales. The Company is aware of approximately 14 competitors in the U.S. packaged vegetable industry, many of which are privately held companies. The Company is aware of approximately nine competitors in the U.S. packaged fruit industry. In addition, there are significant quantities of fruit that are imported from Europe, Asia and South America.

During the past year, approximately 12% of the Company's packaged foods sales were packed for retail customers under the Company's branded labels of Seneca &#174;, Libby's &#174; , Green Valley &#174; , Aunt Nellie's &#174; , READ &#174; , and Seneca Farms &#174; . About 25% of packaged foods sales were packed for institutional food distributors and 52% were retail packed under the private label of our customers. The remaining 11% was sold under the Alliance Agreement with GMOL and the succeeding contract packing agreement with B&#38;G Foods (collectively the "Green Giant Agreement") (see note 12 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Termination of the Green Giant Agreement would substantially reduce the Company's sales and profitability unless the Company was to enter into a new substantial supply relationship with Green Giant or another major vegetable marketer. The non-Green Giant customers represent a full cross section of the retail, institutional, distributor, and industrial markets; and the Company does not consider itself dependent on any single sales source other than sales attributable to the Green Giant Agreement.

The Company's principal branded products are its Libby's canned fruit and vegetable products, which rate among the top three national brands according to a leading market research firm.

Environmental Regulation 

Environmental Protection

Environmental protection is an area that has been worked on diligently at each food packaging facility. In all locations, the Company has cooperated with federal, state, and local environmental protection authorities in developing and maintaining suitable antipollution facilities. In general, we believe our pollution control facilities are equal to or somewhat superior to those of our competitors and are within environmental protection standards. The Company does not expect any material capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations in the near future.

There has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulations aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. In the United States, there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be forthcoming at the federal level to address the effects of climate change. Such regulation could result in the creation of additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.

Environmental Litigation and Contingencies

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is made a party to certain legal proceedings seeking monetary damages, including proceedings involving product liability claims, worker's compensation and other employee claims, tort and other general liability claims, for which it carries insurance as well as patent infringement and related litigation. The Company is in a highly regulated industry and is also periodically involved in government actions for regulatory violations and other matters surrounding the manufacturing of its products, including, but not limited to, environmental, employee, and product safety issues. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company does not believe that an adverse decision in any of these legal proceedings would have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Employment 

At our fiscal year end 2016, the Company had approximately 3,500 employees of which 3,000 full time and 400 seasonal employees work in food packaging and 100 full time employees work in other activities. The number of employees increases by approximately 7,000 due to an increase in seasonal employees during our peak pack season.

The Company has seven collective bargaining agreements with three unions covering approximately 1,050 of its full-time employees. The terms of these agreements result in wages and benefits which are substantially the same for comparable positions for the Company's non-union employees. There are no agreements expiring in calendar 2017. There are two agreements that will expire in 2018, two agreements that will expire in calendar 2019 and three agreements that will expire in calendar 2020.
