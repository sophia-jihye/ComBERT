 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

TSR, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is primarily engaged in the business of providing contract computer programming services to its customers. The Company provides its customers with technical computer personnel to supplement their in-house information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) capabilities. The Company&#8217;s customers for its contract computer programming services consist primarily of Fortune 1000 companies with significant technology budgets. In the year ended May 31, 2016, the Company provided IT staffing services to 77 customers. 

&#160; 

The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1969. The Company&#8217;s executive offices are located at 400 Oser Avenue, Suite 150, Hauppauge, NY 11788, and its telephone number is (631) 231-0333.

Contract Computer Programming Services 

&#160; 

STAFFING SERVICES 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s contract computer programming services involve the provision of technical staff to customers to meet the specialized requirements of their IT operations. The technical personnel provided by the Company generally supplement the in-house capabilities of the Company&#8217;s customers. The Company&#8217;s approach is to make available to its customers a broad range of technical personnel to meet their requirements rather than focusing on specific specialized areas. The Company has staffing capabilities in the areas of mainframe and mid-range computer operations, personal computers and client-server support, internet and e-commerce operations, voice and data communications (including local and wide area networks) and help desk support. The Company&#8217;s services provide customers with flexibility in staffing their day-to-day operations, as well as special projects, on a short-term or long-term basis. 

&#160; 

The Company provides technical employees for projects, which usually range from three months to one year. Generally, customers may terminate projects at any time. Staffing services are provided at the client&#8217;s facility and are billed primarily on an hourly basis based on the actual hours worked by technical personnel provided by the Company and with reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. The Company pays its technical personnel on a semi-monthly basis and invoices its customers, not less frequently than monthly. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s success is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to attract and retain qualified professional computer personnel. The Company believes that there is significant competition for software professionals with the skills and experience necessary to perform the services offered by the Company. Although the Company generally has been successful in attracting employees with the skills needed to fulfill customer engagements, demand for qualified professionals conversant with certain technologies may outstrip supply as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving computer technology or as competition for technical personnel increases. Increasing demand for qualified personnel could also result in increased expenses to hire and retain qualified technical personnel and could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s profit margins. 

&#160; 

In the past several years, an increasing number of companies are using or are considering using low cost offshore outsourcing centers, particularly in India, to perform technology related work and projects. This trend has contributed to the decline in domestic IT staffing revenue. There can be no assurance that this trend will not continue to adversely impact the Company&#8217;s IT staffing revenue.

OPERATIONS 

&#160; 

The Company provides contract computer programming services in the New York metropolitan area, New England, and the Mid-Atlantic region. The Company provides its services principally through offices located in New York, New York, Edison, New Jersey and Long Island, New York. The Company does not currently intend to open additional offices. 

&#160; 

In the fall of 2010, the Company established a program to hire and train recent college graduates to become technical recruiters. The initial costs associated with the hiring and training of such personnel have increased the costs of recruitment, although, over time, the Company believes this program will provide the Company with a larger pool of skilled technical recruiters at a lower cost than hiring experienced technical recruiters. Competition from larger competitors for the newly trained recruiters has created more turnover than expected, making it more difficult to increase the number of technical recruiters on staff. The Company has also hired additional account executives in an effort to increase growth. Turnover has also been greater than expected with account executives due to increased competition. As of May 31, 2016, the Company employed 23 persons who are responsible for recruiting technical personnel and 13 persons who are account executives. As of May 31, 2015, the Company had employed 24 technical personnel recruiters and 13 account executives. Although the number of technical recruiters and account executives has remained substantially the same in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, there have been several personnel changes within each group. 

&#160; 

MARKETING AND CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

The Company focuses its marketing efforts on large businesses and institutions with significant IT budgets and recurring staffing and software development needs. The Company provided services to 77 customers during the year ended May 31, 2016 as compared to 74 in the prior fiscal year. The Company has historically derived a significant percentage of its total revenue from a relatively small number of customers. In the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, the Company had four customers which each provided more than 10% of consolidated revenues: Pontoon, formerly Beeline (17.7%), Citigroup (16.3%), Credit Suisse (10.7%) and Consolidated Edison (10.3%). Pontoon provides vendor management services under an arrangement where the Company enters into a subcontract with Pontoon and Pontoon directly contracts with five end customers. The Pontoon end customers for which the Company provides services include Bristol Myers Squibb, which alone constituted 9.8% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue for the year ended May 31, 2016. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s top ten customers (including end customers of vendor management companies) accounted for 82% of consolidated revenue in fiscal 2016 and 80% in fiscal 2015. While continuing its efforts to further expand its client base, the Company&#8217;s marketing efforts are focused primarily on increasing business from its existing accounts. Approximately 35% of the Company&#8217;s revenue is derived from end customers in the financial services business. Continuing economic pressures in financial services have affected the net effective rates that the Company charges to certain of the Company&#8217;s end customers in this industry, which has negatively affected the Company&#8217;s gross profit margins. 

&#160; 

Many of the Company&#8217;s major customers, totaling over 46% of revenue, have retained a third party to provide vendor management services and centralize the consultant hiring process. Under this system, the third party retains the Company to provide contract computer programming services, the Company bills the third party and the third party bills the ultimate customer. This process has weakened the relationships the Company has built with its customers&#8217; project managers, who are the Company&#8217;s primary contacts with its customers and with whom the Company would normally work to place consultants. Instead, the Company is required to interface with the vendor management provider, making it more difficult to maintain its relationships with its customers and preserve and expand its business. These changes have also reduced the Company&#8217;s profit margins because the vendor management company is retained for the purpose of keeping costs down for the end client and receives a processing fee which is deducted from the payment to the Company. 

&#160; 

In accordance with industry practice, most of the Company&#8217;s contracts for contract computer programming services are terminable by either the client or the Company on short notice. The Company does not believe that backlog is material to its business. 

&#160; 

PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND RECRUITMENT 

&#160; 

In addition to using internet based job boards such as Dice, Monster and Discover.org, the Company maintains a database of technical personnel with a wide range of skills. The Company uses a sophisticated proprietary computer system to match potential employees&#8217; skills and experience with client requirements. The Company periodically contacts personnel within its database to update their availability, skills, employment interests and other matters and continually updates its database. This database is made available to the account executives and recruiters at each of the Company&#8217;s offices. 

&#160; 

The Company employs technical personnel primarily on an hourly basis, as required in order to meet the staffing requirements under particular contracts or for particular projects. The Company recruits technical personnel by posting jobs on the Internet, publishing advertisements in local newspapers and attending job fairs on a periodic basis. The Company devotes significant resources to recruiting technical personnel, maintaining 23 recruiters based in the U.S. and contracting with an India based company for 6 recruiters in India to help locate U.S. based technical consultants. Potential applicants are generally interviewed and tested by the Company&#8217;s recruiting personnel, by third parties that have the required technical backgrounds to review the qualifications of the applicants, or by on-line testing services. In some cases, instead of employing technical personnel directly, the Company uses subcontractors who employ the technical personnel who are provided to the Company&#8217;s customers. For a small fee, the Company may sometimes process payments on behalf of customers to contractors identified by the customers directly instead of through the normal recruiting process; this is known as &#8220;payrolling&#8221;.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The technical staffing industry is highly competitive and fragmented and has low barriers to entry. The Company competes for potential customers with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, other providers of technical staffing services and, to a lesser extent, temporary personnel agencies. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining customers are accurate assessment of customers&#8217; requirements, timely assignment of technical employees with appropriate skills and the price of services. The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified technical personnel are compensation, availability, quality and variety of projects and schedule flexibility. The Company believes that many of the technical personnel included in its database may also be pursuing other employment opportunities. Therefore, the Company believes that its responsiveness to the needs of technical personnel is an important factor in the Company&#8217;s ability to fill projects. Although the Company believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors, it expects competition to increase and there can be no assurance that the Company will remain competitive. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160;

The Company relies primarily upon a combination of trade secret, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect its proprietary rights. The Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, customers and potential customers and limits access to and distribution of its proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information or that the Company will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce its intellectual property rights. 

&#160; 

Personnel 

&#160;

As of May 31, 2016, the Company employed 320 people including its 3 executive officers. Of such employees, 13 were engaged in sales, 23 were recruiters for programmers, 268 were technical and programming consultants, and 13 were in administrative and clerical functions. None of the Company&#8217;s employees belong to unions.
