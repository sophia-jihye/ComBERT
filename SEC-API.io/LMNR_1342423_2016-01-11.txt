Overview 

&#160; 

We are an agribusiness and real estate development company founded and based in Santa Paula, California, committed to responsibly using and managing our approximately 10,700 acres of land, water resources and other assets to maximize long-term stockholder value. Our current operations consist of fruit production, sales and marketing, rental operations, real estate development and capital investment activities.

&#160;

We are one of California&#8217;s oldest citrus growers. According to Sunkist Growers, Inc. (&#8220;Sunkist&#8221;), we are one of the largest growers of lemons in the United States and, according to the California Avocado Commission, one of the largest growers of avocados in the United States. In addition to growing lemons and avocados, we grow oranges and a variety of specialty citrus and other crops. We have agricultural plantings throughout Ventura, Tulare, San Bernardino, and San Luis Obispo Counties in California and in Yuma County in Arizona, which plantings consist of approximately 4,200 acres of lemons, 1,100 acres of avocados, 1,400 acres of oranges and 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops. We also operate our own packinghouses in Santa Paula, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process, pack and sell lemons that we grow as well as lemons grown by others.

&#160;

Our water resources include water rights, usage rights and pumping rights to the water in aquifers under, and canals that run through, the land we own. Water for our farming operations is sourced from the existing water resources associated with our land, which includes rights to water in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and the un-adjudicated Fillmore and Paso Robles Basins (aquifers). We use ground water from the San Joaquin Valley Basin and water from water districts and irrigation districts in Tulare County, which is in California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley and we use ground water from the Cadiz Valley Basin in San Bernardino County. We also use surface water in Arizona from the Colorado River through the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage District.

&#160;

For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic investments in California agricultural and real estate development. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have four active real estate development projects in California. These projects include multi-family housing and single-family homes comprising approximately 250 completed units and another approximately 1,800 units in various stages of planning and entitlement.

&#160; 

Fiscal Year 2015 Highlights and Recent Developments 

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2015, we substantially completed our agriculture workforce housing project in Santa Paula, California. We began renting 65 units in May 2015 and annual rental revenue from the additional housing units is anticipated to be approximately $0.9 million. The total cost of the development was approximately $9.5 million and we capitalized approximately $2.7 million of costs related to this project in fiscal year 2015.

&#160;

A project to double the capacity and increase the efficiency of our lemon packing facilities was substantially completed during fiscal year 2015 and is expected to become operational during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. To date we have capitalized approximately $24.1 million and in fiscal year 2015 we capitalized approximately $15.6 million of costs in connection with construction services and equipment related to this project. The project is expected to cost approximately $25.0 million in the aggregate.

&#160;

On February 3, 2015, we amended our lease agreement with Cadiz Real Estate, LLC (&#8220;Cadiz&#8221;). The amendment, among other things; increased by 200 acres the amount of property leased by us under the lease agreement dated July 1, 2013. In connection with the amendment, we paid a total of $1.2 million to acquire existing lemon trees and irrigations systems from Cadiz and a Cadiz tenant.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On February 17, 2015, the City of Santa Paula unanimously approved our updated East Area I Master Tentative Tract Map, Supplemental Environmental Impact Report and updated Development Agreement. The property is now fully entitled and we have the requisite approvals to break ground on the East Area I and II projects.

&#160;

On August 21, 2015, we sold Wilson Ranch property, which was comprised of 52 acres of land with 33 acres of avocado orchards located in Ventura County, California. The sale price was approximately $2.8 million and the gain on the sale was approximately $0.9 million. The sales price represents approximately $53,000 and $83,000 per acre for total acres and productive avocado acres, respectively.

&#160;

In September 2015, we completed the acquisition of 157 acres of lemon, orange and specialty citrus orchards in California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley, for approximately $3.4 million. The orchards were acquired pursuant to purchase options contained in certain operating leases we have been party to since 2012 for approximately 1,000 acres of lemon, orange and specialty citrus and other crops, which we refer to as the Sheldon Ranch leases.

&#160;

We also entered into a purchase agreement in September 2015 to acquire an additional 757 acres of lemon, orange and specialty citrus orchards in California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley, for approximately $15.1 million, pursuant to the purchase options contained in the Sheldon Ranches operating leases. We paid a deposit of $50,000 in September 2015 and the transaction closed in December 2015.

&#160;

On November 10, 2015, we entered into a joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (&#8220;Lewis&#8221;) for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC (the &#8220;Joint Venture&#8221;) as the development entity, contributed our East Area I property to the Joint Venture and sold a 50% interest in the Joint Venture to Lewis for $20.0 million, comprised of a $2.0 million deposit received in September 2015 and $18.0 million received on November 10, 2015. We expect to receive $100.0 million from the Joint Venture over the estimated 7 to 10 year life of the project. The Joint Venture partners will share in capital contributions to fund project costs until loan proceeds and/or revenues are sufficient to fund the project. These funding requirements are currently estimated to total $10.0 to $15.0 million for each Joint Venture partner in the first two years of the project, with a smaller amount of funding expected in the first year. We also entered to a lease agreement with the Joint Venture to lease back a portion of the contributed property, which allows us to continue farming the property during the phased build-out of the project.

&#160;

On December 18, 2015, we drew an advance of $8,000,000 from Wells Fargo Equipment Finance, Inc. and became obligated under an interim funding agreement with Wells Fargo. The advance was obtained in connection with us financing the purchase of certain equipment associated with our new lemon packing facilities. Upon the completion of the purchase of the equipment, we intend to include the advance in the aggregate funding of a $10,000,000 term loan pursuant to a Master Loan and Security Agreement and a Loan Schedule with Wells Fargo, with a first priority security interest in the equipment to Wells Fargo. The interest rate on the interim funding is LIBOR plus 2% and the rate will become fixed upon establishment of the term loan.

&#160;

For fiscal year 2015, we declared cash dividends to our stockholders totaling $0.18 per common share in the aggregate amount of approximately $2.5 million compared to a total of $0.17 per common share in the aggregate amount of approximately $2.3 million for fiscal year 2014. On December 15, 2015, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per common share payable on January 15, 2016 in the aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 million to stockholders of record on December 28, 2015. This represents an 11% increase compared to our previous quarterly dividend of $0.045 per common share.

&#160;

Business Divisions 

&#160;

We have three business divisions: agribusiness, rental operations, and real estate development. The agribusiness division is comprised of two reportable segments, lemon operations and other agribusiness, and includes our farming, harvesting, lemon packing and lemon sales operations. The rental operations division includes our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. The real estate development division includes our real estate projects and development. Financial information and discussion of our four reportable segments, lemon operations, other agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development, are contained in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report.

&#160; 

Agribusiness Division 

&#160;

The agribusiness division is comprised of two of our reportable segments, lemon operations and other agribusiness, and represented approximately 95%, 95% and 94% of our fiscal year 2015, 2014 and 2013 consolidated revenues, respectively, of which lemon operations represented 79%, 77% and 68% of our fiscal year 2015, 2014 and 2013 consolidated revenues, respectively, and other agribusiness represented 16%, 18% and 26% of our fiscal year 2015, 2014 and 2013 consolidated revenues, respectively.

&#160;

Farming 

&#160;

We are one of California&#8217;s oldest citrus growers and one of the largest growers of lemons and avocados in the United States. In addition to growing lemons and avocados, we grow oranges and a variety of specialty citrus and other crops. We have agricultural plantings throughout Ventura, San Bernardino and San Luis Obispo Counties in California and Yuma County in Arizona, which collectively consist of approximately 4,200 acres of lemons, 1,100 acres of avocados, 1,400 acres of oranges and 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops. We also operate our own packinghouses in Santa Paula, California and Yuma, Arizona, where we process, pack and sell lemons we grow as well as lemons grown by others.

&#160;

Lemons. Our lemon farming is included in our &#8220;lemon operations&#8221; reportable segment within our financial statements. We market and sell lemons directly to food service, wholesale and retail customers throughout the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia and certain other international markets. We are one of the largest lemon growers in the United States with approximately 4,200 acres of lemons planted primarily in Ventura and Tulare Counties in California and in Yuma County, Arizona. In California, the lemon growing area stretches from the Coachella Valley to Fresno and Monterey Counties, with the majority of the growing areas being located in the coastal areas from Ventura County to Monterey County. Ventura County is California&#8217;s top lemon producing county. Approximately 40% of our lemons are grown in Ventura County, 30% are grown in Tulare County, 20% are grown in Yuma County, Arizona and 10% are grown in San Bernardino County, California.

&#160;

There are over fifty varieties of lemons, with the Lisbon, Eureka and Genoa being the predominant varieties marketed on a worldwide basis. California grown lemons are available throughout the year, with peak production periods occurring from January through August. Approximately 90% of our lemon plantings are of the Lisbon and Eureka varieties and approximately 10% are of other varieties such as sweet Meyer lemons, proprietary seedless lemons and pink variegated lemons. The storage life of fresh lemons generally ranges from one to 18 weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.

&#160;

With an average annual production of approximately 750,000 tons of lemons, California accounts for approximately 90% of the United States lemon crop, with Arizona producing a vast majority of the rest. Between 50% and 70% of the United States lemon crop is utilized in the fresh market, with the remainder going to the processed market for products such as juice, oils and essences. Most lemons are consumed as either a cooking ingredient, a garnish, or as juice in lemonade or carbonated beverages or other drinks. Demand for lemons is typically highest in the summer, although California producers through various geographical zones are typically able to harvest lemons year round.

&#160;

Avocados. Our avocado farming is included in our &#8220;other agribusiness&#8221; reportable segment within our financial statements. We are one of the largest avocado growers in the United States with approximately 1,100 acres of avocados planted throughout Ventura County. In California, the avocado growing area stretches from San Diego County to Monterey County, with the majority of the growing areas located approximately 100 miles north and south of Los Angeles County.

&#160;

Over the last 75 years, the avocado has transitioned from a single specialty fruit to an array of 10 varieties ranging from the green-skinned Zutanos to the black-skinned Hass, which is the predominant avocado variety marketed on a worldwide basis. California-grown avocados are available year round, with peak production periods occurring between February and September. Other avocado varieties have a more limited picking season and typically command a lower price. Because of superior eating quality, the Hass avocado has contributed greatly to the avocado&#8217;s growing popularity through its retail, restaurant and other food service uses. Approximately 98% of our avocado plantings are of the Hass variety. The storage life of fresh avocados generally ranges from one to four weeks, depending upon the maturity of the fruit, the growing methods used and the handling conditions in the distribution chain.

&#160;

We provide all of our avocado production to Calavo Growers, Inc. (&#8220;Calavo&#8221;), a packing and marketing company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CVGW. Calavo&#8217;s customers include many of the largest retail and food service companies in the United States and Canada. Our marketing relationship with Calavo dates back to 2003. Calavo receives fruit from our orchards at its packinghouse located in Santa Paula, California. Calavo&#8217;s proximity to our agricultural operations enables us to keep transportation and handling costs to a minimum. Our avocados are packed by Calavo and sold and distributed under its own brands to its customers primarily in the United States and Canada.

&#160;

Primarily due to differing soil conditions, the care of avocado trees is intensive and during our 75-year history of growing avocados, growing techniques have changed dramatically. The need for more production per acre to compete with foreign sources of supply has required us to take an important lead in the practice of dense planting (typically four times the number of avocado trees per acre versus traditional avocado plantings) and mulching composition to help trees acclimate under conditions that more closely resemble those found in the tropics, a better climate for avocado growth. 

&#160;

Oranges. Our orange farming is included in our &#8220;other agribusiness&#8221; reportable segment within our financial statements. While we are primarily known for our high-quality lemons, we also grow oranges. We have approximately 1,400 acres of oranges planted throughout Tulare County, California. In California, the growing area for oranges stretches from Imperial County to Yolo County.

&#160; 

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

For many decades, the Valencia variety of oranges was grown in Ventura County primarily for export to the Pacific Rim. Throughout the late 20th century, developing countries began producing the larger, seedless Navel variety of oranges that successfully competed against the smaller Valencia variety. California grown Navel oranges are available from October to June, with peak production periods occurring between January and April. California grown Valencia oranges are available from March to October, with peak production periods occurring between June and September. Approximately 95% of our orange plantings are of the Navel variety and approximately 5% are of the Valencia variety.

&#160;

Navel oranges comprise most of California&#8217;s orange crop, accounting for approximately 75% over the past three growing seasons. Valencia oranges account for a vast majority of the remainder of California&#8217;s orange crop. While California produces approximately 25% of the nation&#8217;s oranges, its crop accounts for approximately 80% of those going to the fresh market. The share of California&#8217;s crop going to fresh market, as opposed to the processed market (i.e. juices, oils and essences) varies by season, depending on the quality of the crop.

&#160;

We utilize Sunkist to market and sell a portion of our oranges under the Sunkist brand to food service wholesale and retail customers. As an agricultural cooperative, Sunkist coordinates the sales and marketing of our oranges, and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses for direct shipment to customers. We also utilize packinghouses which are not members of agricultural cooperatives to process, market and sell our oranges. We estimate approximately 70% of our oranges are sold to retail customers and approximately 30% are sold to wholesale customers.

&#160;

Specialty Citrus and Other Crops. Our specialty citrus and other crop farming is included in our &#8220;other agribusiness&#8221; reportable segment within our financial statements. A few decades ago we began growing specialty citrus varieties and other crops that we believed would appeal to changing North American and worldwide demand. As a result, we currently have approximately 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops planted such as Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios and olives.

&#160;

Acreage devoted to specialty citrus and other crops in California has been growing significantly over the past few decades, especially with the popularity of the Clementine, a type of mandarin orange. Similar to our oranges, a portion of our specialty citrus is marketed and sold under the Sunkist brand by Sunkist and orders are processed by Sunkist-member packinghouses for direct shipment to customers. We also utilize packinghouses which are not members of agricultural cooperatives to process, market and sell our specialty citrus.

&#160;

We currently market our other crops, such as pistachios and olives, utilizing packinghouses which are not members of agricultural cooperatives. Our pistachios are harvested and sold to a roaster, packager and marketer of nuts and our olives are harvested and sold to a processor and marketer of olives.

&#160;

&#160;

We manage the Cadiz Ranches under operating lease arrangements. We purchased substantially all of the Sheldon Ranches property in two separate transactions, which closed in September and December 2015. We previously managed the Sheldon Ranches under operating lease arrangements.

&#160;

The other agribusiness land in the table above include corporate and lemon packing facilities, land leased to other agricultural businesses, rental units, roads, creeks, hillsides and other open land.

&#160;

Our orchards can maintain production for many years. For financial reporting purposes, we depreciate our orchards from 20 to 40 years depending on the fruit variety with the majority of our orchards depreciated over 20 to 30 years. We regularly evaluate our orchards&#8217; production and growing costs, and based on these and other factors we may decide to redevelop certain orchards. In addition, we may acquire agricultural property with existing productive orchards or without productive orchards, which would require new orchard plantings. The fruit varieties that we grow typically are non-producing for approximately the first four years after planting. Orchards may continue producing fruit longer than their depreciable lives.

Lemon Packing and Sales 

&#160;

We are the oldest continuous lemon packing operation in North America. We pack and sell lemons grown by us as well as lemons grown by others, which operations are included in our financial statements under the reportable segment &#8220;lemon operations.&#8221; Lemons delivered to our packinghouses in Santa Paula, California and Yuma, Arizona are sized, graded, cooled, ripened and packed for delivery to customers. Our ability to accurately estimate the size, grade and timing of the delivery of the annual lemon crop has a substantial impact on both our costs and the sales price we receive for the fruit.

&#160;

A significant portion of the costs related to our lemon packing operation is fixed. Our strategy for growing the profitability of our lemon packing operations calls for optimizing the percentage of a crop that goes to the fresh market, or fresh utilization, and procuring a larger percentage of the California and Arizona lemon crop.

&#160;

We invest considerable time and research into refining and improving our lemon operations through innovation and are continuously in search of new techniques to refine how premium lemons are delivered to our consumers. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we anticipate our new lemon packing facility will become operational, which is expected to double our lemon packing capacity and increase the efficiency of these operations.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Rental Operations Division 

&#160;

Our rental operations division is provided for in our financial statements as its own reportable segment and includes our residential and commercial rentals, leased land operations and organic recycling. The rental operations division represented approximately 5%, 4% and 5% of our fiscal year 2015, 2014 and 2013 consolidated revenues, respectively.

&#160; 

Residential 

&#160;

We own and maintain approximately 250 residential housing units located in Ventura and Tulare Counties that we lease to employees, former employees and non-employees. In fiscal 2015, we added 65 new agriculture workforce housing units in Santa Paula, California. These properties generate reliable cash flows which we use to partially fund the operating costs of our business and provide affordable housing for many of our employees and the community.

&#160;

Commercial 

&#160;

We own several commercial office buildings and a multi-use facility consisting of a retail convenience store, gas station, car wash, and quick-serve restaurant. As with our residential housing units, these properties generate reliable cash flows which we use to partially fund the operating costs of our business.

&#160;

Leased Land 

&#160;

As of October 31, 2015, we lease approximately 600 acres of our land to third-party agricultural tenants who grow a variety of row crops such as strawberries, raspberries, celery and cabbage. Our leased land business provides us with a profitable method to diversify the use of our land.

&#160;

Organic Recycling 

&#160;

With the help of one of our tenants, Agromin, a processor of premium soil products and a green waste recycler located in Oxnard, California, we have implemented an organic recycling program. Agromin provides green waste recycling for cities in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. We worked with Agromin to develop an organic recycling facility on our land in Ventura County, to receive green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark, plant materials) and convert such material into mulch that we spread throughout our agricultural properties to help curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures. We receive a percentage of the gate fees Agromin collects from regional waste haulers and enjoy the benefits of the organic material.

&#160;

Real Estate Development Division 

&#160;

Our real estate development division is provided for in our financial statements as its own reportable segment and includes our real estate development operations. The real estate development division had no significant revenues in fiscal year 2015 and represented approximately 1% of our consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.

&#160;

For more than 100 years, we have been making strategic real estate investments in California agricultural and developable real estate. Our current real estate developments include developable land parcels, multi-family housing and single-family homes with approximately 1,800 units in various stages of planning and development. The following is a summary of each of the strategic agricultural and development real estate investment properties in which we own an interest:

&#160;

East Area I - Santa Paula, California. East Area I consists of 523 acres that we presently use as agricultural land and is located in Santa Paula approximately ten miles from the City of Ventura and the Pacific Ocean. This property is also known as our Teague McKevett Ranch. We believe East Area I is an ideal location for a master planned community of commercial and residential properties designed to satisfy expected demand in a region that we believe will have few other developments in this coming decade. In 2008, after we completed a process of community planning and environmental review, the citizens of Santa Paula voted to approve the annexation of East Area I into Santa Paula. This vote was a requirement of the Save Open-Space and Agricultural Resources, or SOAR, ordinance that mandates a public vote of the City of Santa Paula for land use conversion.

&#160;

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On November 10, 2015, we entered into a joint venture with The Lewis Group of Companies (&#8220;Lewis&#8221;) for the residential development of our East Area I real estate development project. To consummate the transaction, we formed Limoneira Lewis Community Builders, LLC (the &#8220;Joint Venture&#8221;) as the development entity, contributed our East Area I property to the Joint Venture and sold a 50% interest in the Joint Venture to Lewis for $20.0 million, comprised of a $2.0 million deposit received in September 2015 and $18.0 million received on November 10, 2015. We expect to receive $100.0 million from the Joint Venture over the estimated 7 to 10 year life of the project. The Joint Venture partners will share in capital contributions to fund project costs until loan proceeds and/or revenues are sufficient to fund the project. These funding requirements are currently estimated to total $10.0 to $15.0 million for each Joint Venture partner in the first two years of the project, with a smaller amount of funding expected in the first year. We also entered into a lease agreement with the Joint Venture to lease back a portion of the contributed property, which allows us to continue farming the property during the phased build-out of the project.

&#160;

East Area II - Santa Paula, California. We and our design associates are in the process of formulating plans for East Area II, a parcel of approximately 30 acres adjacent to East Area I, also a part of our Teague McKevett Ranch, that we believe is suited to commercial and/or industrial development along the south side of California Highway 126, a heavily traveled corridor that connects Highway 101 at Ventura on the west with Interstate 5 at Santa Clarita on the east. When completed, we expect that the development will contribute to the economic vitality of the region and allow residents to work and shop within close proximity to their homes.

&#160;

The successful development of East Area II will be partly dependent on the success of East Area I described above. We expect that East Area II could accommodate large retailers, a medium or large employer, a complex of mixed business and retail, or some combination of the foregoing. We are actively cultivating prospects to buy land in or become future tenants in East Area II and expect that development will closely follow the build-out of East Area I.

&#160;

Windfall Farms - Creston, California. Windfall Farms is an approximately 700 acre former thoroughbred breeding farm and equestrian facility located in Creston, California, near Paso Robles. The property has paved roads, water wells, irrigation, piping, stables, homes, other out-buildings and a race track. Restrictions imposed by the California Land Conservation Act (also known as the Williamson Act) expired at the end of calendar year 2012 and presently up to as many as 74 parcels as small as ten acres each can be subdivided and resold, creating small agricultural parcels with home sites. We planted approximately 200 acres of vineyards during fiscal years 2014 and 2015. Vineyards are generally productive after four years.

&#160;

Santa Maria - Santa Barbara County, California. As of October 31, 2015 we were invested in three entitled development parcels in Santa Barbara County, California, a county that, in our experience, entitles very few parcels. Located in Santa Maria, each of these parcels offers a residential and/or commercial development opportunity. A brief description of each parcel follows:

&#160;

&#183; Centennial Square has been approved for 138 apartments on 6 acres, is close to medical facilities, shopping and transportation. &#160;

&#183; The Terraces at Pacific Crest is an approximately eight-acre parcel approved for 112 attached-housing units. &#160;

&#183; Sevilla is approved for 69 single-family homes adjacent to shopping, transportation, schools, parks and medical facilities, with a parcel of approximately 3 acres zoned for commercial use. &#160;

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

Agribusiness Division 

&#160;

With agricultural operations dating back to 1893, we are one of California&#8217;s oldest citrus growers and one of the largest growers of lemons and avocados in the United States. Consequently, we have developed significant experience with a variety of crops, mainly lemons, avocados and oranges. The following is a brief list of what we believe are our significant competitive strengths with respect to our agribusiness division, which includes our lemon operations and other agribusiness reportable segments unless otherwise noted:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Our agricultural properties in Ventura County are located near the Pacific Ocean, which provides an ideal environment for growing lemons, avocados and row crops. Our agricultural properties in Tulare County, which is in the San Joaquin Valley in Central California, and in Yuma, Arizona, are also located in areas that are well-suited for growing citrus crops. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Historically, a higher percentage of our crops go to the fresh market, which is commonly referred to as fresh utilization, than that of other growers and packers with which we compete. &#160;

&#160; &#183; We have contiguous and nearby land resources that permit us to efficiently use our agricultural land and resources. &#160;

10&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; In all but one of our properties, we are not dependent on State or Federal water projects to support our agribusiness or real estate development operations. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; We own approximately 93% of our agricultural land and take a long view on our fruit production practices. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; A significant amount of our agribusiness property was acquired many years ago, which results in a low cost basis and associated expenses. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; We have a well-trained and retentive labor force with many employees remaining with us for more than 30 years. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; In our lemon operations segment, our integrated business model with respect to growing, packing, marketing and selling lemons allows us to better serve our customers. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; Our lemon packing operations provide marketing opportunities with other citrus companies and their respective products. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; Since 2010, we have achieved and maintained GLOBALGAP Certification by successfully demonstrating our adherence to specific GLOBALGAP standards. GLOBALGAP is an internationally recognized set of farm standards dedicated to &#8220;Good Agricultural Practices&#8221; or GAP. We believe that GLOBALGAP Certification differentiates us from our competitors and serves as reassurance to consumers and retailers that food reaches acceptable levels of safety and quality, and has been produced sustainably, respecting the health, safety and welfare of workers and the environment, and in consideration of animal welfare issues. &#160;

&#160; &#183; We have made investments in ground-based solar projects that provide us with tangible and intangible non-revenue generating benefits. The electricity generated by these investments provides us with a significant portion of the electricity required to operate our packinghouse and cold storage facilities located in Santa Paula, California and provides a significant portion of the electricity required to operate four deep-water well pumps at one of our ranches in Tulare County. Additionally, these investments support our sustainable agricultural practices, reduce our dependence on fossil-based electricity generation and lower our carbon footprint. Moreover, electricity that we generate and do not use is conveyed seamlessly back to the investor-owned utilities operating in these two markets. Finally, over time, we expect that our customers and the end consumers of our fruit will value the investments that we have made in renewable energy as a part of our farming and packing operations, which we believe may help us differentiate our products from similar commodities.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; We have made various other investments in water rights, mutual water companies and cooperative memberships. We own shares in the following mutual water companies: Farmers Irrigation Co., Canyon Irrigation Co., San Cayetano Mutual Water Co., Middle Road Mutual Water Co., and Pioneer Water Company, Inc. In 2007, we acquired additional water rights in the adjudicated Santa Paula Basin (aquifer) and in September 2013 we acquired water rights in the YMIDD with our acquisition of Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. (&#8220;Associated&#8221;). &#160; 

Rental Operations Division 

&#160;

With respect to our rental operations division, we believe our competitive advantages are as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Our housing and land rentals provide a consistent, dependable source of cash flow that helps to counter the volatility typically associated with an agricultural business. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Our housing rental business allows us to offer a unique benefit to our employees, which in turn helps to provide us with a dependable, long-term employee base. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Our leased land business allows us to partner with other agricultural producers that can serve as a profitable alternative to under-producing tree crop acreage. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Our organic recycling tenant provides us with a low cost, environmentally friendly solution to weed and erosion control. &#160; 

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Real Estate Development Division 

&#160;

With respect to our real estate development division, we believe our competitive advantages are as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Our real estate development activities are primarily focused in coastal areas north of Los Angeles and south of Santa Maria, which we believe have desirable climates for lifestyle families, retirees, and athletic and sports enthusiasts.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; We have entitlements to build approximately 1,500 residential units in our East Area I (Santa Paula Gateway) development and approximately 300 residential units in our Santa Maria properties.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; We have partnered with an experienced and financially strong land developer for our East Area I residential master plan development.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Several of our agricultural and real estate investment properties are unique and carry longer term development potential.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Our East Area II property has approximately 30 acres of land commercially zoned, which is adjacent to our East Area I property. Our Santa Maria properties have approximately 3 acres zoned for mixed use retail, commercial and light manufacturing. &#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160;

While each of our business divisions has a separate business strategy, we are an agribusiness and real estate development company that generates annual cash flows to support investments in agricultural and real estate development activities. As our agricultural and real estate development investments are monetized, we intend to seek to expand our agribusiness into new regions and markets and invest in cash producing residential, commercial and industrial rental assets.

&#160;

The following describes the key elements of our business strategy for each of our agribusiness, rental operations and real estate development business divisions.

&#160;

Agribusiness Division 

&#160;

With respect to our agribusiness division, key elements of our strategy are:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Acquire Additional Lemon Producing Properties . To the extent attractive opportunities arise and our capital availability permits, we intend to consider the acquisition of additional lemon producing properties. In order to be considered, such properties would need to have certain characteristics to provide acceptable returns, such as an adequate source of water, a warm micro-climate and well-drained soils. We anticipate that the most attractive opportunities to acquire lemon producing properties will be in the San Joaquin Valley near our existing operations in Tulare County. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Expand our Sources of Lemon Supply. Peak lemon production occurs at different times of the year depending on geographic region. In addition to our lemon production in California and Arizona and lemons we acquire from third-party growers, we plan to expand our lemon supply sources to international markets such as Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Increases in lemons procured from third-party growers and international sources improve our ability to provide our customers with fresh lemons throughout the year. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Increase the Volume of our Lemon Packing Operations . We regularly monitor our costs for redundancies and opportunities for cost reductions. In this regard, cost per carton is a function of throughput. We continually seek to acquire additional lemons from third-party growers to pack through our plant. Third-party growers are only added if we determine their fruit is of good quality and can be cost effective for both us and the grower. Of most importance is the overall fresh utilization rate for our fruit, which is directly related to quality. &#160;

&#183; Expand International Production and Marketing of Lemons . We estimate that we currently have approximately 5% of the fresh lemon market in the United States and a larger share of the United States lemon export market. We intend to explore opportunities to expand our international production and marketing of lemons. We have the ability to supply a wide range of customers and markets and, because we produce high quality lemons, we can export our lemons to international customers, which many of our competitors are unable to supply. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Construction of a New Lemon Packinghouse . Over the years, new machinery and equipment along with upgrades have been added to our nearly 80 year-old packinghouse and cold storage facilities. This, along with an aggressive and proactive maintenance program, has allowed us to operate an efficient, competitive lemon packing facility. As described above in &#8220;Overview &#8211; Fiscal Year 2015 Highlights and Recent Developments,&#8221; a project to double the capacity and increase the efficiency of our lemon packing facilities was substantially completed during fiscal year 2015 and is expected to become operational during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. We expect that this project will ultimately increase fresh lemon processing capacity and lower our packing costs by reducing labor and handling inputs. &#160;

12&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Opportunistically Expand Our Plantings of Oranges, Specialty Citrus and Other Crops . Our plantings of oranges, specialty citrus and other crops have been profitable and have been pursued to diversify our product line. Agricultural land that we believe is not suitable for lemons is typically planted with oranges, specialty citrus or other crops. While we intend to expand our orange, specialty citrus and other crops, we expect to do so on an opportunistic basis in locations that we believe offer a record of historical profitability. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Opportunistically Expand our Plantings of Avocados . We may opportunistically expand our plantings of avocados primarily because our profitability and cash flow realized from our avocados frequently offset occasional losses in other crops we grow and help to diversify our fruit production base. 

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Maintain and Grow our Relationship with Calavo . Our alignment with and ownership stake in Calavo comprises our current marketing strategy for avocados. Calavo has expanded its sourcing into other regions of the world, including Mexico, Chile and Peru, which allows it to supply avocados to its retail and food service customers on a year-round basis. California avocados occupy a unique market window in the year-round supply chain and Calavo has experienced a general expansion of volume as consumption has grown. Thus, we intend to continue to have a strong and viable market for our California avocados as well as an equity participation in Calavo&#8217;s overall expansion and profitability. &#160; 

Rental Operations Division 

&#160;

With respect to our rental operations division, key elements of our strategy include the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Secure Additional Rental and Housing Units . Our housing, commercial and land rental operations provide us with a consistent, dependable source of cash flow that helps to fund our overall activities. Additionally, we believe our housing rental operation allows us to offer a unique benefit to our employees. We have built and leased 65 out of a total of 71 approved additional units through infill projects on existing sites and groupings of units on new sites within our owned acreage. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Opportunistically Lease Land to Third-Party Crop Farmers . We regularly monitor the profitability of our fruit-producing acreage to ensure acceptable per acre returns. When we determine that leasing the land to third-party row crop farmers would be more profitable than farming the land, we intend to seek third-party row crop tenants.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Opportunistically Expand our Income-Producing Commercial and Industrial Rental Assets . We intend to redeploy our future financial gains to acquire additional income-producing real estate investments and agricultural properties. &#160;

Real Estate Development Division 

&#160;

With respect to our real estate development division, key elements of our strategy include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Selectively and Responsibly Develop our Agricultural Land . We recognize that long-term strategies are required for successful real estate development activities. We thus intend to maintain our position as a responsible agricultural land owner and major employer in Ventura County while focusing our real estate development activities on those agricultural land parcels that we believe offer the best opportunities to demonstrate our long-term vision for our community. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Opportunistically Increase our Real Estate Holdings . We intend to redeploy our future financial gains to acquire additional income-producing real estate investments and agricultural properties. &#160;

Customers 

&#160;

In our lemon operations segment, since November 2010, we have marketed and sold our lemons directly to our food service, wholesale and retail customers in the United States, Canada, Asia, Australia and certain other international markets. Previously, Sunkist marketed and sold the majority of our lemons. We sold lemons to approximately 165 U.S. and international customers during fiscal year 2015. In our other agribusiness segment, our oranges, specialty citrus and other crops are sold through Sunkist and other packinghouses. We sell all of our avocados to Calavo.

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

In our lemons operations segment, paper is considered to be a material raw product for our business because most of our products are packed in cardboard cartons for shipment. Paper is readily available and we have numerous suppliers for such material.

&#160; 

13&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Information about Geographic Areas 

&#160;

During fiscal year 2015, lemon sales were comprised of 75% domestic sales, 21% sales to domestic exporters and 4% international sales. During fiscal year 2014, lemon sales were comprised of 74% domestic sales, 25% sales to domestic exporters and 1% international sales. During fiscal year 2013, lemon sales were comprised of 72% domestic sales, 27% sales to domestic exporters and 1 % international sales. All of our avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops are sold to packinghouses and processors located in the United States. All of our long-lived assets are located within the United States and we have an investment in a citrus packing, marketing and sales business in La Serena, Chile.

&#160; 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

&#160;

As with any agribusiness enterprise, our agribusiness division operations are predominantly seasonal in nature. The harvest and sale of our lemons, avocados, oranges and specialty citrus and other crops occurs in all quarters, but is generally more concentrated during our third quarter. With respect to our lemon operations segment, our lemons are generally grown and marketed throughout the year. In terms of our other agribusiness segment, our avocados are sold generally throughout the year with the peak months being February through September. Our Navel oranges are primarily sold January through April and our Valencia oranges are primarily sold June through September. Our specialty citrus is sold from November through June and our specialty crops, such as pistachios and olives, are sold in September and/or October.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The agribusiness division crop markets, including those in which our lemon operations and other agribusiness segments operate, are intensely competitive, but no single producer has any significant market power over any market segments, as is consistent with the production of most agricultural commodities. Generally, there are a large number of global producers that sell through joint marketing organizations and cooperatives. Fruit is also sold to independent packers, both public and private, who then sell to their own customer base. Customers are typically large retail chains, food service companies, industrial manufacturers and distributors who sell and deliver to smaller customers in local markets throughout the world. In the purest sense, our largest competitors in our agribusiness division are other citrus and avocado producers in California, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Florida, a number of which are members of cooperatives such as Sunkist or have selling relationships with Calavo similar to that of Limoneira. In another sense, we compete with other fruits and vegetables for the share of consumer expenditures devoted to fresh fruit and vegetables: apples, pears, melons, pineapples and other tropical fruit. In our other agribusiness segment specifically, avocado products compete in the supermarket with hummus products and other dips and salsas. U.S. producers of fruit and tree nuts generate approximately $19 billion of fruit and tree nuts each year, about 15% of which is exported. For our specific crops, the size of the U.S. market is approximately $375 million for lemons, approximately $300 to $400 million for avocados depending on the year, and approximately $1.5 to $2.0 billion for oranges, both fresh and juice. Competition in the various markets in which our agribusiness division operates is affected by reliability of supply, product quality, brand recognition and perception, price and the ability to satisfy changing customer preferences through innovative product offerings.

&#160;

The sale and leasing of residential, commercial and industrial real estate is very competitive, with competition coming from numerous and varied sources throughout California. Our greatest direct competition for each of our current real estate development properties in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties comes from other residential and commercial developments in nearby areas. Windfall Farms competes generally with the second home and life-style real estate market, which includes golf course communities, marinas, destination resorts and other equestrian facilities located in Southern California and, therefore, its competition ranges over a greater area and range of consumer options.

Research and Development 

&#160;

For our agribusiness division, our research and development programs concentrate on sustaining the productivity of our agricultural lands, product quality and value-added product development. Agricultural research is directed toward sustaining and improving product yields and product quality by examining and improving agricultural practices in all phases of production (such as the development of specifically adapted plant varieties, land preparation, fertilization, pest and disease control, post-harvest handling, packing and shipping procedures), and includes on-site technical services and the implementation and monitoring of recommended agricultural practices. Research efforts are also directed towards integrated pest management. We conduct agricultural research at field facilities throughout our growing areas. We also sponsor research related to environmental improvements and the protection of worker and community health. The aggregate amounts we spent on research and development in each of the last three years have not been material in any such year.

&#160; 

Environmental and Regulatory Matters 

&#160;

Our agribusiness and real estate development operations are subject to a broad range of evolving federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. For example, the growing, packing, storing and distributing of our products is extensively regulated by various federal and state agencies. The California State Department of Food and Agriculture oversees our packing and processing of lemons and conducts tests for fruit quality and packaging standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations which govern the use of pesticides and other potentially hazardous substances and the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties. Advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations, including those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

&#160;

We seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses, and we are not aware of any instances of material non-compliance. We believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain compliance with applicable governmental laws, regulations, permits and licenses. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations for necessary permits and licenses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions. These remedies can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
