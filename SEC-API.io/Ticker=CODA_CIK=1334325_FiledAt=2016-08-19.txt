&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (&#8220;Coda,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) designs and manufactures patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products for sale to the subsea, defense, mining and marine sciences markets, among others. In addition, we supply marine engineering business services to prime defense contractors. 

&#160; 

We operate through two operating business segments: Marine Technology Business (&#8220;Products&#8221; segment) and Marine Engineering Business (&#8220;Services&#8221; or &#8220;Contracting&#8221; segment). Our products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas and wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major oil and gas companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense companies, universities and research and development institutions. 

&#160; 

We supply our marine engineering business services mainly to prime defense contractors. We have been supporting some significant defense programs for over 20 years, including the Close In Weapon Support program that enables us to supply, upgrade and maintain proprietary parts to these programs on an ongoing basis. 

&#160; 

Our subsea marine technology products sold through our three wholly owned subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Products, Inc. (USA.), Coda Octopus Products Limited (United Kingdom), and Coda Octopus Products Pty Limited (Australia) and through our appointed agents globally. Our marine engineering business services are provided through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (&#8220;Colmek&#8221;) based in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Coda Octopus Martech Limited (&#8220;Martech&#8221;) based in the United Kingdom. 

&#160; 

Our corporate structure is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

The Company began as Coda Technologies Ltd (now operating under the name of Coda Octopus Products Limited), a UK corporation which was formed in 1994 as a start-up company with its origins as a research group at Herriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland. Initially, its operations consisted primarily of developing software for subsea mapping and visualization using sidescan sonar, a technology widely used in commercial offshore geophysical survey and naval mine-hunting to detect objects on, and textures of, the surface of the seabed. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In June 2002, we acquired by way of a merger Octopus Marine Systems Ltd, a UK corporation, and changed our name from Coda Technologies Ltd to Coda Octopus Ltd. At the time of its acquisition, Octopus Marine Systems was producing geophysical products broadly similar to those of Coda, but targeted at the less sophisticated, easy-to-use, &#8220;work-horse&#8221; market. It was also finalizing the development of a new motion sensing device (the &#8220;F180&#8221;), which was to be employed aboard vessels conducting underwater surveys to correct sonar measurement by providing precise positioning and compensation for vessel motion. 

&#160; 

In December 2002, Coda Octopus Ltd acquired OmniTech AS, a Norwegian company, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and now operates under the name Coda Octopus R&#38;D AS. Before we acquired OmniTech, it had been engaged for over ten years in developing revolutionary sonar imaging and visualization technology to produce three-dimensional underwater images for use in the subsea construction industry. Now marketed by ourselves under the product name &#8220;Echoscope&#174;&#8221;, this technology is unique in that it generates real time 3D images in low or zero visibility conditions. This technology has been patented in a number of jurisdictions, including the USA. This technology, which continues to be developed by our Research and Development team in the UK and Norway, allowed the Company to start to expand the original focus on hydrographic and geophysical survey to include the high end sonar market. At the inception of the Marine Technology Business our revenues were generated solely from our geophysical software product. Thereafter, we added the F180 series in 2002 and our revenues were split over these two products. With the addition of our real time 3D products, our revenues are now mainly generated from this suite of products and associated services. 

&#160; 

On July 13, 2004, pursuant to the terms of a share exchange agreement between The Panda Project, Inc., a Florida corporation, and a now defunct entity affiliated with Coda Octopus Ltd. (&#8220;Coda Parent&#8221;), Panda acquired the shares of Coda Octopus Limited, a UK corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Coda Parent, in consideration for the issuance of a total of 20,050,000 shares of common stock to Coda Parent and other shareholders of Coda Octopus Limited. The shares issued represented approximately 90.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Panda. The share exchange was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of Panda by Coda. Subsequently, Panda was reincorporated in Delaware and changed its name to Coda Octopus Group, Inc. 

&#160; 

In June 2006, we acquired a design and engineering company, Martech Systems (Weymouth) Ltd (&#8220;Martech&#8221;), which provides bespoke engineering solutions in the fields of electronic data acquisition, transmission and recording, and which has links into our existing markets. Martech are suppliers to prime defense engineering companies. Martech has changed its name to Coda Octopus Martech Limited in December 2008. 

&#160; 

In April 2007, we acquired Colmek (then Miller &#38; Hilton d/b/a Colmek), a custom engineering service provider of defense engineering to prime contractors. Colmek has been supporting a number of defense programs since the early 1990&#8217;s. Specifically, it supplies proprietary parts into these programs including providing upgrades to such parts to address either obsolescence issues or advancement in technology. This Company changed its name to Coda Octopus Colmek Inc. in December 2008. 

&#160; 

Marine Technology Business (&#8220;Products Segment&#8221;) 

&#160; 

Our Marine Technology Business sells proprietary marine products in a number of worldwide market segments: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Commercial marine geophysical survey; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Oil &#38; gas; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Energy &#38; renewables; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Underwater security, law enforcement and naval operations; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Underwater construction (asset placements, block placements, mattress placement, cable and pipe lay inspection and the like); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Environmental Applications (example mammal research; natural gas seeps; habitat assessment; fisheries); and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Salvage and decommissioning. &#160; 

In the commercial marine geophysical survey sector, our products include geophysical data acquisition systems, analysis software and motion detection equipment that are used primarily by survey companies, research institutions and salvage companies. 

&#160; 

We believe we possess an important and unique sonar technology, which is patented, and which gives us a significant advantage over our competitors in the market sectors where real time visualization is key and/or low or zero visibility conditions prevail. 

&#160; 

Our product range includes products based on our patented Echoscope &#174; in combination with our proprietary software which also includes patented techniques for rendering and tracking. We believe that our products are revolutionizing the sonar market, particularly in real time data acquisition, and subsea visualization in low or zero visibility conditions. This patented technology is the result of more than 20 years of research and development by our subsidiary, Coda Octopus R&#38;D AS (CORDAS), Norway, which we acquired in 2002, and our software development team based in the UK. Our R&#38;D Team in Norway is focused on the hardware component of our technology whereas our R&#38;D Team in Edinburgh is focused on the accompanying software for this technology. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Since the acquisition of CORDAS, we have significantly advanced our research and development with respect to both hardware and software components, filed further patents and brought to market our third generation of the Echoscope &#174; and the CodaOctopus Underwater Inspection System (UIS) as well as new derivative products, such as our forward looking sonar, Dimension &#174; and our Echoscope C500 (a smaller and lighter variant of the Echoscope &#174; ). 

&#160; 

We are focusing our research and development resources and budget on developing our 4 th generation of real time 3D solutions for various market applications and varying price points. We believe this strategy will help to standardize real time 3D solutions in the subsea market and expand the applications for which the technology is used. 

&#160; 

We have also introduced to the market the capabilities of real time 3D sonars. This technology is being adopted for many oil &#38; gas, energy, subsea asset placements (blocks, mattresses and other installations), decommissioning and leak identification projects. Most of these projects require real time volumetric visualization. 

&#160; 

A series of trials by independent experts and operators in the marine / subsea market have validated our longstanding position that the Echoscope &#174; performance exceeds that of the current standard industry tools (such as the multi-beam sonar) in a number of key applications and provides unparalleled image resolution and beam density. We believe that these capabilities combined with our unique real time visualization advantage, our volumetric data acquisition capability and ability to measure things in real time combined with the further technological advances currently being developed, place the Echoscope &#174; in a position to become the sonar of choice for many underwater applications in the future . 

&#160; 

Moreover, many users in complex operations such as underwater construction are reporting significant time savings, and health and safety benefits, which allow them to out-perform their competitors. We believe that our real time 3D solutions including the Echoscope &#174; , which is being referred to by one of our significant customers as &#8220;[their] underwater eyes&#8221;, are making progress in shifting the conservative approach of the sonar market. Our technology is also used for bespoke and complex underwater construction that requires real time visualization. We believe that our real time 3D solutions are now being viewed as the products of choice in many complex operations. We further believe that our next generation of the real time 3D solutions will become the tools of choice for a much greater number of underwater applications through improved efficiency in work flow process presented by real time visualization capabilities. 

&#160; 

We believe that our patented technology is the only commercially available sonar that can provide true real-time 3D volumetric imaging data underwater even in the most challenging zero visibility conditions. This unique capability provides unparalleled underwater scene awareness in similarly high frame rates as cameras and without the reliance of complex and costly positioning and motion reference units or the need for costly post processing of the underwater data acquired. The resultant scene data can be used for multiple tasks simultaneously including object detection and avoidance in true 3D, complex scene mapping and augmented reality 3D workspace imaging combining the real-time 3D data with 3D models, together providing real-time decision making and assessment. 

&#160; 

The Echoscope &#174; has a wide range of applications including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; inspection of harbor walls; &#160; &#9679; inspection of ship hulls; &#160; &#9679; inspection of bridge pilings; &#160; &#9679; block placements (in the context of breakwater construction) &#160; &#9679; subsea asset placements including landings &#160; &#9679; deep sea mining &#160; &#9679; cable laying, cable pull in operations &#160; &#9679; inspection of offshore installations such as gas and oil rigs and wind turbines; &#160; &#9679; Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) navigation (obstacle avoidance); &#160; &#9679; Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation and target recognition (obstacle avoidance); &#160; &#9679; construction - pipeline touchdown placement and inspection; &#160; &#9679; obstacle avoidance navigation; &#160; &#9679; bathymetry (measurement of water depth to create 3D terrain models); &#160; &#9679; managing underwater construction tasks; &#160; &#9679; underwater intruder detection; &#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; dredging and rock dumping; &#160; &#9679; contraband detection; &#160; &#9679; locating and identifying objects undersea, including mines; &#160; &#9679; detection and study of individual species in real time 3D (fish, whales etc.); &#160; &#9679; oil and gas leak detection; &#160; &#9679; fish school detection and analysis; &#160; &#9679; diver tracking and guidance; &#160; &#9679; underwater archaeological and salvage site mapping; &#160; &#9679; decommissioning; &#160; &#9679; offshore renewable energy &#8211; cable laying and burial and pull-in; &#160; &#9679; marine salvage operations; &#160; &#9679; harbor construction &#8211; concrete armoring; and &#160; &#9679; unexploded ordinances survey and intervention. &#160; 

Within these applications, the technology can essentially provide real time 3D visualization of static scenes or moving objects from either a static location or a dynamically moving platform (vessel, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (&#8220;AUV&#8221;) or Remotely Operated Vehicle (&#8220;ROV&#8221;)). Conventional sonars are capable of producing maps of static scenes only. 

&#160; 

The Echoscope &#174; technology is protected by patents, including a number of complementary patents such as a patent which covers our visualization methodology and our rendering of our real time 3D images. For example, one of our recently awarded patents provides for a new method of using multiple sonar images to produce in real-time 3D a very detailed image with sharply defined edges while intelligently discarding &#8220;noise&#8221; in the image produced by (for example) passing fish or floating debris. 

&#160; 

We market the Echoscope &#174; both as a stand-alone sonar device and as a fully integrated system, marketed under the name &#8220;CodaOctopus UIS (Underwater Inspection System)&#8221;. The latter is specifically aimed at the port security market and has been adopted by a significant number of ports in the United States. Until recently, we have not had any success with foreign ports for this product. In 2015 we have had success in introducing the system in one East Asian port where it is now on a program of adoption and where it will be used for amongst other applications, salvage and port and harbor inspection. 

&#160; 

Due to the price point for our real time 3D solutions, we offer these for rent. The equipment is typically supplied with Echoscope &#174; engineering (operator) services. This rental offering is an increasing and important market for the business and also provides access to the technology to a broader range of users. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Our products are marketed under the &#8220;CodaOctopus&#8221; brand and consist of three main product lines: 

&#160; 

Real Time 3D Sonar includes our unique and patented real time 3D sonars and cutting edge software (including patented techniques for rendering and tracking algorithms) that we believe is shaping the future of subsea operations. 

&#160; 

Data Acquisition Products includes integrated hardware acquisition devices that feature rich post-processing software for all levels of geophysical survey work 

&#160; 

Motion Sensing Products consists of a range of GPS-aided precision attitude and positioning systems and post-processing software for all types of marine survey and positioning work. 

&#160; 

Real Time 3D Sonar 

&#160; 

We offer four products within the real time 3D sonar: the Echoscope &#174; , the Echoscope&#174; C500 (launched in 2014), the Dimension &#174; and the CodaOctopus Underwater Inspections System. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Echoscope &#174; 

&#160; 

We believe that our real-time 3D imaging sonar technology represents the Company&#8217;s most promising area for growth in the medium term. Echoscope &#174; , developed over a period of more than 20 years, is a unique, patented technology generating high resolution 3D images of the underwater environment in low or zero visibility conditions in real time. For each sonar ping that is emitted by the Echoscope &#174; , it receives 16,384 pieces of information back. The competition&#8217;s multibeam sonar system receives back approximately 256 pieces of information for each sonar ping. This means in real time the probability of finding an underwater target/object is substantially greater with the Echoscope &#174; than the conventional sonar equipment (such as multibeam or other imaging sonars). 

&#160; 

Our current Echoscope &#174; is approximately 15x11.8x6.3 inches and connects to a laptop with gaming specifications or similar hardware configuration which is required to handle the volume of data generated by our sonar. 

&#160; 

We are unaware of any other product with the capabilities of the Echoscope &#174; . The heightened awareness of terrorist attacks over the last two decades has resulted in a demand for practical, effective and rapid methods of detecting potential threats (such as explosives in harbors or on ship hulls). We believe that our real time 3D solutions including the Echoscope &#174; are ideally suited for this task, as it provides highly detailed 3D images in real time including in difficult sea conditions where there is low or zero visibility. 

&#160; 

The Echoscope &#174; systems will sometimes require additional equipment to form a complete solution allowing us to leverage existing products and services, such as motion sensors and imaging processing software, into a wider market, and this in turn offers further opportunity for other products from the portfolio, such as our F180 &#174; positioning systems (Motion Sensing Product), discussed below. 

&#160; 

Our Software development capability is an important part of the success we have achieved to date with our real time 3D solutions and our strategy to maintain our lead in designing, manufacturing and selling real time 3D solutions. Our real time 3D solutions are sold with Coda Octopus proprietary top end software, Underwater Survey Explorer&#8221; (&#8220;USE&#8221;), and Vantage or Construction Monitoring System (&#8220;CMS). Our Software Package is feature rich and includes significant capabilities that are designed to address subsea challenges by application particularly in the context of a dynamic subsea setting (as opposed to a static mapping of the seabed as is typical for conventional sonar technology). Some of our unique features include: 

&#160; 

Feature Description &#160; Functionality Real Time Measurements &#160; important for many types of subsea operations such as block or asset placements or aiding diving operations; Models + Software Module &#160; allows the user to import existing models and engineering drawings into the real time subsea environment Edge Detection Algorithm &#160; allows the user to superimpose an edge to easily identify a subsea target Rendering a Noise Free Image &#160; allows for a crisp, clear and high resolution photo-like image without any processing (which would be required for conventional sonars) Tracking Algorithm &#160; Algorithm is used to track known objects within the real time 3D Data. This is currently utilized in our Construction Monitoring Software Package (see below) &#160; 

The Echoscope &#174; and CodaOctopus Construction Monitoring Software (CMS) Software have important applications for breakwater construction. Our CMS package has been recently updated to include patented algorithms for tracking and placement of the single layer armor blocks used in a breakwater construction. 

&#160; 

The CodaOctopus solution is one of two preferred solutions for breakwater construction and increasingly the CodaOctopus&#8217; solution is becoming the preferred solution for subsea block placements in breakwater solutions because of the capabilities that allow the crane operator to visualize the blocks while they are being placed in real-time. The CodaOctopus solution has significantly simplified and made safer this area of the workflow process in breakwater construction. 

&#160; 

We do not believe that this important capability along with real-time visualization and monitoring of the construction site including previously laid blocks is possible with competing solutions. In addition, the feature rich software package (CMS) which allows the complete workflow for breakwater construction to be planned within the software, greatly reduces risks and time to the project and improves the quality of project deliverables and progress throughout. The patented tracking algorithms that have recently been enhanced and strengthened allow onward opportunity for similar applications involving placing known objects or structures underwater for other applications as well. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Dimension &#174; 

&#160; 

Designed for the remotely operated underwater vehicle (&#8220;ROV&#8221;) market, the Dimension &#174; real time 3D forward looking sonar with CodaOctopus Vantage software (&#8220;Vantage&#8221;) offers a step-change view to ROV pilots. With a user-selectable quad-view of the scene in front of the ROV, the pilot can maneuver, navigate and monitor with confidence during zero visibility conditions. 

&#160; 

Based on our patented Echoscope &#174; technology and our Vantage software, Dimension &#174; provides unparalleled real-time visualization for subsea vehicle applications. Designed for a wide range of ROVs, Dimension &#174; is a unique, true real-time 3D sonar that transforms ROV underwater operations. 

&#160; 

Using the Vantage software suite and advanced beam forming techniques, the Dimension &#174; sonar provides the ROV pilot with a unique quad-view for safe navigation and obstacle avoidance purposes. The Vantage quad-view features a conventional plan-view, commonly provided by scanning sonars, along with three additional and separate real-time perspectives of the subsea environment. 

&#160; 

Echoscope&#174; C500 (&#8220;C500&#8221;) 

&#160; 

The C500 was launched in 2014 and is based on our patented Echoscope &#174; technology and delivers real-time 3D sonar capability in a smaller, lighter, ruggedized form factor with reduced power requirements. It is suitable for ROV and autonomous underwater vehicle (&#8220;AUV&#8221;) based applications as well as vessel deployments. 

&#160; 

Fully integrated with our powerful Underwater Survey Explorer software, the C500 can be used with the full range of functionality available including the latest Models+ software module allowing dynamic control of sonar with augmented 3D models in the 3D Workspace. The C500 allows the acquisition of full real-time 3D data in a time efficient manner. 

&#160; 

As a result of the reduced form factor, reduced power consumption requirements and price point, this new product opens new markets for our real time 3D solutions. 

&#160; 

Software Products 

&#160; 

All our sonars are sold with one of three proprietary software applications, Underwater Survey Explorer, Vantage or our Construction Monitoring System (CMS). Our Software packages are critical to the usability of our real time 3D sonar solutions.

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We conduct worldwide sales and marketing through each company individually, with our synergies, national and international exposure sought under the management of the heads of each operation. This structure provides dedicated sales effort in each of the Group companies, and encourages cross-selling and marketing of other Group companies&#8217; products and services. Generally, our focus is on widening our market reach and on selling broader services, systems and solutions within our existing customer base. 

&#160; 

Our marketing effort is dedicated to enhancing, reinforcing, and protecting the value of our lead in this emerging market, broadening our current product and systems-based offerings to be able to offer complete solutions. However, within that we have the following supporting marketing sub-strategies: 

&#160; 

Product : Build on the significant lead that we have in the market for cutting edge real time 3D solutions by designing and developing the next generation of real time underwater 3D solutions in a superior form to our existing products and thereby open new markets for these solutions by having superior price, performance and customer utility at the forefront of our strategies. 

&#160; 

Place : The use of strategic partnerships, at the higher value end of the market, particularly to provide solutions rather than product (e.g. the provision, through partnership, of a complete port security solution to a major port), and the use of existing and new sales agents to provide sales leads for lower value but very important &#8220;pure&#8221; product sales. We also work with carefully selected agents who through their local relationships or capabilities are able to market and promote our products and assist us in opening new markets for our real time 3D solutions. 

&#160; 

Promotion : The attendance and illustration of our capabilities at trade shows, use of customer mailing, advertising and trade public relations.

Competition 

&#160; 

Data Acquisition Products 

&#160; 

The sonar equipment industry is fragmented with several companies occupying niche areas, and we face competition from different companies with respect to our different products. In the field of geophysical products Triton Imaging Inc., a US-based company, now part of the ECA Group (Toulon, France), Chesapeake, a US-based company, and Oceanic Imaging Consultants, Hawaii, USA, dominate the market with an estimated of 25% each of world sales, while we believe that we control approximately 10% of world-wide sales. 

&#160; 

Motion Sensing Products 

&#160; 

In the field of motion sensing equipment, where our product addresses a small part of the overall market, we believe that we have four principal competitors: TSS (International) Ltd in Watford, England which is focused on the mid-performance segments with about 25% of the world market; Ixsea, a French company which covers all segments, with about 20% of the market; Kongsberg Seatex, a Norwegian company (part of Kongsberg Gruppen) which has products across all segments, with about 15% of the market; and Applanix, a Canadian company, now part of Trimble which has one major product focused on the high end of the market, with about 20% of the market. We believe that our market share in the field of motion sensing equipment is only about 10%. 

&#160; 

Real Time 3D Sonar 

&#160; 

In the field of Real Time 3D imaging, we are unaware of other companies offering a similar product. The entry into this market is dependent upon specialized marine electronics and acoustic skills. The learning curve, which has resulted in the advancement of our real time 3D sonar device, is the culmination of two decades of research and development into this field. We are also aware of a number of high profile and substantial competitors&#8217; real time 3D projects that have failed. Over the last several years there have been lower grade sonars entering the market of 3D imaging. Companies such as Tritech International Ltd., United Kingdom, and BlueView Technologies Inc., USA (now a part of Teledyne), are examples, but none of these sonar offerings are direct comparisons or competitors in respect of our real time 3D solutions as we believe that they do not have the same capabilities as our patented Echoscope &#174; technology in terms of generating real time 3D images of submerged objects and environments in low or zero visibility conditions. 

&#160; 

We seek to compete on the basis of producing high quality products employing cutting edge technology that is easy to use by operators without specialized skills in sonar technology. We intend to continue our research and development activities to continually improve our products, seek new applications for our existing products and to develop new innovative products. 

&#160; 

Marine Engineering Businesses 

&#160; 

Through our marine engineering operations, Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. and Coda Octopus Martech Limited, we are involved in custom engineering for the defense industry in the United States, and in the United Kingdom. Martech competes with larger contractors in the defense industry. Typical among these are Ultra Electronics, BAE Systems, and Thales, all of whom are also partners on various projects. In addition, the strongest competitors are often the clients themselves. Because of their size, they often have the option to proceed with a project in-house instead of outsourcing to a sub-contractor like Martech or Colmek. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our product portfolio and technologies are protected by intellectual property rights including trademarks, copyrights and patents. We have a number of fundamental patents including a patent covering the stitching together of acoustic imagery.
