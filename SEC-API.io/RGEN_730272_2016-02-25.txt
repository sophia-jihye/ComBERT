Overview 

Repligen Corporation (&#147;Repligen,&#148; the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;we&#148;) is a bioprocessing company focused on the development, production and commercialization of innovative products used in the process of manufacturing biologic drugs (&#147;bioprocessing&#148;). Biologic drugs include monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins and vaccines and represent a growing area of drug development. Our customers include leading life sciences companies, global biopharmaceutical companies, and contract manufacturers worldwide. The high-value technologies that we provide enable biologics manufacturers to cost-effectively increase drug production yields while retaining the highest quality and safety standards. 

Repligen is a longtime global market leader in the manufacture of Protein A ligands, sold to life sciences companies under long term supply agreements. Protein A is a critical reagent used to purify monoclonal antibodies (&#147;mAbs&#148;) on the market (over 50) or in development (over 300). In December 2011, we strengthened our Protein A market leadership with the acquisition of Novozymes&#146;s bioprocessing business (&#147;Novozymes&#148;) in Lund, Sweden (the &#147;Novozymes Acquisition&#148;). 

We established and have executed on a diversification strategy to selectively expand the number of bioprocessing products that we sell directly to end users. With the Novozymes Acquisition, we gained a portfolio of growth factors, led by LONG &#174; R3 IGF-1, which is used in cell culture media to increase productivity. LONG &#174; R3 IGF-1 is sold in collaboration with MilliporeSigma (formerly Sigma Aldrich), our exclusive distributor for the product. We also developed and directly market our OPUS &#174; process-scale line of pre-packed chromatography columns for the capture and purification of biologic drugs in clinical development. Most recently, in June 2014, we acquired the business of Refine Technology, including Refine&#146;s Alternating Tangential Flow (&#147;ATF&#148;) System, a best-in-class device used to generate extremely high cell concentrations during the fermentation step of the biologic drug manufacturing process (the &#147;Refine Business&#148; and the acquisition of the Refine Business, the &#147;Refine Acquisition&#148;). 

We market our products globally through a direct commercial organization in the U.S., Europe and Asia, as well as through strategic partners in select markets. In 2014 and 2015, we invested in expanding our global commercial organization, adding sales, marketing and applications personnel who interact directly with our end users. Our customer base comprises of leading life sciences companies, major contract manufacturers and 20 of the top 25 biopharmaceutical companies. 

Customers use our products to produce initial quantities of drug for clinical studies, then scale-up to larger volumes as the drug progresses to commercial production following regulatory approval. Detailed specifications for a drug&#146;s manufacturing process are included in applications that must be approved by regulators, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, throughout the clinical trial process and prior to final commercial approval. As a result, products that become part of the manufacturing specifications of a late-stage clinical or commercial process can be very &#147;sticky&#148; due to the regulatory hurdles, costs and uncertainties associated with displacing them. 

&#160; 

Many of our products are early in their adoption cycle, and together with the expansion of our commercial organization and strategic acquisitions, have contributed to product revenue expansion from $41.8 million in 2012 to $83.5 million in 2015. To meet increased demand for our products, we have increased the volume and scale of manufacturing at our two manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Sweden. 

We were incorporated in May 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 41 Seyon Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02453 and our telephone number is (781) 250-0111. We conduct manufacturing in Waltham and at our facility in Lund, Sweden. 

Our Market Opportunity 

The global biologics drug market is estimated to be over $200 billion. This market includes mAbs, proteins and vaccines. mAb-based biologics alone accounted for approximately $80 billion of revenue, and represented six of the top 10 best-selling drugs across the pharmaceutical industry, in 2014. Industry sources project the biologics market to grow at approximately 8-10% annually over the next five years, driven by strength in the mAb class of biologics. This strength is evidenced by the rate of new approvals, expanded labels for marketed mAbs and the emergence of biosimilar versions of originator mAbs. In 2015, a record of nine therapeutic mAbs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a diverse range of diseases, including the first-ever approvals of mAbs to control LDL or &#147;bad cholesterol.&#148; There are currently more than 300 mAbs in various stages of clinical development, addressing a wide range of medical conditions including asthma, migraines and Alzheimer&#146;s disease. 

In addition to investments in the discovery and development of novel biologic drugs, there has been substantial investment in follow-on products (biosimilars and biobetters) by generic and specialty pharmaceutical as well as large biopharmaceutical companies. We believe development of follow-on products is accelerating as the first major mAbs begin to come off patent in the EU and U.S. For example, there are at least 12 companies attempting to market the first Humira &#174; (adalimumab) biosimilar, which faces patent expiration in the U.S. at the end of 2016. Also, due to the high cost of biologic drugs, many countries in the developing and emerging markets have been aggressively investing in biomanufacturing capabilities to supply lower cost alternatives or biosimilars for the local markets We believe they are focused on innovative technologies that offer greater manufacturing flexibility, production yields and lower-costs through improved process efficiencies. 

The Biologics Manufacturing Process 

Manufacturing biologic drugs requires three fundamental steps. First, upstream manufacturing involves the production of the biologic by living cells that are grown in a bioreactor under controlled conditions. These cells, or factories, are highly sensitive to the conditions under which they grow, including the composition of the cell culture media and the growth factors used to stimulate increased cell growth and protein production, or titre. In the second, downstream step, the biologic must be separated and purified, typically through various filtration and chromatography steps. In the third stage of the process, the purified biologic drug is formulated, quality controlled and packaged into its final injectable form. 

Biologics are generally high value therapies. Given the inherent complexities of the process and drug product, we have observed that manufacturers are seeking and investing in innovative technologies that address pressure points in the production process in order to improve yields. We see that manufacturers are also seeking technologies that reduce cost of goods as the biologic drug moves through clinical stages and into commercial processes by adopting single-use technologies as well as other products that confer more flexibility and efficiency. 

&#160; 

Our Products 

Downstream Products 

Protein A 

We are the leading provider of Protein A ligands, an essential component of Protein A chromatography resins (media) used in the purification of virtually all monoclonal antibody-based drugs on the market (more than 50) or in development (more than 300). We manufacture multiple forms of Protein A ligands under long term supply agreements for major life sciences companies including GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma, who in turn sell their Protein A chromatography media to end users (biopharmaceutical manufacturers). We have two manufacturing sites, one in Lund, Sweden and another in Waltham, MA, collectively supporting overall global demand for our Protein A ligands. On February 23, 2016, we amended our long term supply agreements with GE Healthcare to, among other things, extend the terms of the supply agreement relating to our Lund, Sweden facility through 2019. The supply agreement relating to our Waltham, MA facility runs through 2021. This dual manufacturing capability gives us strong business continuity and reduces overall supply risk for our major customers. 

Protein A chromatography media is considered the industry standard for purification of mAbs, due to the ability of Protein A to selectively bind to or &#147;capture&#148; mAbs from crude protein mixtures. Protein A media is packed into chromatography columns as the standard first step in a purification process. As a result of Protein A&#146;s high affinity for antibodies, the mAb product is highly purified and concentrated within this first capture step before moving to polishing steps. The global Protein A media market that we supply generates annual revenues of $350-$400 million. We expect continued growth for our Protein A ligands as new drugs are approved and biosimilar manufacturing accelerates. 

Chromatography products 

Our chromatography portfolio includes a number of products used in the downstream purification and quality control of biological drugs. The main driver of growth in this portfolio is our OPUS &#174; pre-packed chromatography column line. Our other products include Protein A chromatography resins used in a small number of commercial drug processes and ELISA test kits used by quality control departments to detect and measure the presence of leached Protein A in the final product. 

Chromatography columns, packed with chromatography media, are used in biomanufacturing to purify the contents of a bioreactor. For late-stage clinical and large commercial processes, stainless steel columns are standard, and are packed in-house by the biomanufacturer. For clinical stage manufacturing, biomanufacturers value the quick turnover, cost savings and convenience of using pre-packed columns such as OPUS &#174; versus traditional glass columns. 

OPUS columns are pre-packed with purification media and are an efficient plug-and-play solution for our customers, and is a growing area of our business. As biomanufacturers have become acutely focused on improving the drug development process, they are moving towards flexible manufacturing and disposable solutions such as OPUS. Over the past three years we have observed customers moving away from in-house solutions (self-packed glass columns). They are starting to adopt the OPUS ready-to-use format due to convenience, flexibility and consistent product performance. OPUS columns save labor time, reduce overall costs and improve overall manufacturing efficiency, allowing biomanufacturers to reassign resources to higher value-add processes. 

Our OPUS line is distinctly open platform, providing desirable opportunities for customization. For example, most biopharmaceutical manufacturers utilize three different chromatography media in a given process and our flexible columns are designed to meet these needs. We differentiate ourselves in the pre-packed column space by packing any brand of chromatography media in OPUS to any bed height, ensuring the most convenient and efficient process for end users. The plug-and-play nature of our OPUS columns make them ideal for purification of antibodies and recombinant proteins. With the launch of OPUS 45 cm diameter columns in 2014 and 60 cm columns in 2015, we have further differentiated ourselves from our competitors who offer a limited number of column diameter and resin (media) options. By offering these larger columns, we are making inroads in the glass column market which customers typically self-pack. 

&#160; 

Pre-packed chromatography columns are at the early stages of adoption; we estimate that currently, we and our competitors collectively capture approximately 30% of a $165 million addressable market. As our sales force expands and we increase the number of call points, we are seeing more multi-site adoption of our OPUS &#174; prepacked columns, including increased use by contract manufacturers, where quick turnover of multiple production runs is critical to profitability. We expect continued strong growth for this product line as we aim to expand geographically and provide best-in-class service and support. 

Upstream Products 

Growth factors 

Most biopharmaceuticals are produced through a mammalian cell fermentation process. In order to stimulate increased cell growth and maximize overall yield from a bioreactor, manufacturers often add growth factors, such as insulin, to the cell culture fermentation media. As part of the Novozymes Acquisition, we acquired several cell culture growth factor additives. Among those products is LONG &#174; R3 IGF-1, our insulin-like growth factor that has been shown to be 100 times more biologically potent than insulin (the industry standard), thereby increasing recombinant protein production in cell culture fermentation applications. LONG &#174; R3 IGF-1 is currently used in the manufacture of several commercial biopharmaceutical products and is sold through a distribution partnership with MilliporeSigma. Our goal over the last few years with MilliporeSigma has been to focus on pipeline development and work with customers already familiar with the product to more broadly adopt LONG &#174; R3 IGF-1 as a platform product. 

We estimate that the current market for cell culture growth factors is $75-$80 million. We are gaining share of this market as customers displace insulin with LONG &#174; R3 IGF-1. We anticipate continued growth for this product group as our pipeline of opportunities advances from early-stage clinical to late-stage clinical and commercial manufacturing processes. 

ATF Systems 

The ATF System is a technologically advanced filtration device used to continuously remove cellular metabolic waste products during the course of a fermentation run, freeing healthy cells to continue producing the biologic drug of interest. The ATF System is designed to both increase the density of cells in a bioreactor and extend the production run, resulting in significantly greater product yield of up to two- to three-fold as well as reduced costs. This is important to biomanufacturers who seek to maximize output from their existing facilities. ATF Systems consist of a stainless steel housing that contains a consumable filter and an associated pump and controller. We sell the ATF System in a variety of sizes suitable for use in laboratory and scale-up all the way to production bioreactors as large as 2,000 liters. ATF Systems are used in the production of several FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies. 

Following our acquisition of the ATF System from Refine Technology in 2014, we integrated the production of ATF into our operations in Waltham, MA. 

We estimate that the current market for cell retention devices is approximately $125-150 million. Within this market, we expect continued growth for our ATF franchise over the next several years, as biologics manufacturing accelerates globally and as large pharmaceutical customers who have evaluated the system adopt the technology as platform. The ATF System strengthens our upstream fermentation business and significantly broadens our technology base. 

Research and Development 

Our research activities are focused on developing new bioprocessing products. Specifically, we plan to focus these efforts on our ATF, OPUS and chromatography portfolio, including next generation Protein A ligands. Research and development expenses totaled approximately $5.7 million, $5.6 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

Licensing Agreements 

HDAC Agreement with BioMarin 

On January 21, 2014, we out-licensed our HDACi portfolio, which includes the Friedreich&#146;s ataxia program, to BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc. Friedreich&#146;s ataxia is an inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system resulting in symptoms ranging from impaired walking and speech problems to heart disease. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, BioMarin agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize HDACi portfolio product until the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of an issued and unexpired patent or pending patent application claiming a compound included in the agreement or (ii) 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Repligen received an upfront payment of $2 million in January 2014 from BioMarin and we have the potential to receive up to $160 million in future milestone payments for BioMarin&#146;s development, regulatory approval and commercial sale of portfolio compounds included in the agreement. These potential milestone payments are approximately 37% related to clinical development and 63% related to initial commercial sales in specific geographies. In addition, Repligen is eligible to receive royalties on sales of qualified products developed. The royalty rates are tiered and begin in the mid-single-digits for the first HDACi portfolio product and for the first non-HDACi portfolio product with lesser amounts for any backup products developed under the agreement. Repligen&#146;s receipt of these royalties is subject to customary offsets and deductions. There are no refund provisions in this agreement. Royalties under this agreement are paid on a country-by-country basis during the period beginning on the first commercial sale of a compound in such country, until the later of: (i) the expiration of exclusivity period granted by a governmental authority to prevent the entry of generic product into such country; (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of an issued and unexpired patent or pending patent application claiming such compound in such country; or (iii) ten years following the first commercial sale of such HDACi portfolio product in any country. Royalty payments on products derived from the compounds included in the agreement are calculated by multiplying net sales of such product for the calendar year by an applicable royalty rate based on incremental net sale amounts. We have no further obligations to BioMarin. 

SMA Agreement with Pfizer 

On December 28, 2012, we entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement (the &#147;License Agreement&#148;) with Pfizer to advance the SMA program, which is led by RG3039 and also includes backup compounds and enabling technologies. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we received $5 million from Pfizer as an upfront payment on January 22, 2013, a $1 million milestone payment on September 4, 2013 and a $1 million milestone payment on December 28, 2014. On January 26, 2015, Pfizer notified us that they were terminating the License Agreement for convenience, effective as of April 26, 2015. We do not intend to invest additional resources to the development of the SMA program. 

RG1068 

Our clinical development portfolio previously included RG1068, a synthetic human hormone we had developed as a novel imaging agent for the improved detection of pancreatic duct abnormalities in combination with magnetic resonance imaging in patients with pancreatitis and potentially other pancreatic diseases. On December 23, 2014, Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;Innovate&#148;) acquired our RG1068 program for a nominal amount. Innovate is solely responsible for future development and commercialization of RG1068. If Innovate gains marketing approval and successfully commercializes RG1068, Repligen is eligible to receive royalties through the latter of ten years after the first commercial sale or the entry of a generic equivalent into the U.S. market. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales and marketing strategy supports our objective of establishing Repligen as a leading provider of products and services, addressing upstream, downstream and quality control needs of bioprocessing customers in 

&#160; 

the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries. Through our products and brands, including Protein A, LONG &#174; R3 IGF-1, OPUS &#174; , ATF we provide premiere offerings and services to our bioprocess customers. We are committed to being a partner of choice for our customers with distributor and supply agreements in place for our growth factor and Protein A products with GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma. On February 23, 2016, we amended our long term supply agreements with GE Healthcare to, among other things, extend the terms of the supply agreement relating to our Lund, Sweden facility through 2019. The supply agreement relating to our Waltham, MA facility runs through 2021. We have invested in our commercial organization and now have 23 sales, marketing, product management and service individuals providing service and support to our expanding customer base. Our global sales organization has both distributor and direct sales personnel, depending on the market and application area. We will continue to expand our commercial organization. This organization also helps us identify market needs and new technologies that we can license and develop into new products.

Each of our employees has signed a confidentiality agreement. None of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have two collective bargaining agreements that cover our 61 employees in Sweden, comprising approximately 36% of our total workforce. The current collective bargaining agreements expire on March 31, 2016. We are currently in negotiations to renew these collective bargaining agreements, and the risk of any work stoppage is low. The Company considers its employee relations to be satisfactory. 

Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights 

Repligen considers patents to be an important element in the protection of our competitive and proprietary position and actively, and selectively, pursues patent protection in the United States and in major countries 

&#160; 

abroad. As further described below, Repligen owns or has exclusive rights to a number of U.S. patents and U.S. pending patent applications as well as corresponding foreign patents and patent applications. The expiration of key patents owned or licensed by us or the failure of patents to issue on pending patent applications could create increased competition, with potential adverse effects on our business prospects. 

Other forms of market protection, including trade secrets and know-how, are also considered important elements of our proprietary strategy. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants, business partners and major customers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment, consulting, business relationship, or product related audit with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the other party during the course of the relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to Repligen shall be our exclusive property. 

Protein A 

We have developed proprietary technology, trade secrets, and know-how relating to the manufacture of recombinant Protein A at a scale and quality standard which is consistent with the requirements of the biopharmaceutical industry. In addition, in April 2010, we were granted U.S. Patent No. 7,691,608, &#147;Nucleic Acids Encoding Recombinant Protein A,&#148; which claims a recombinant gene that encodes a Protein A molecule with an amino acid sequence identical to that of the natural Protein A molecule, which has long been commercialized for bioprocessing applications. This U.S. patent, with the term adjustment that was granted, will remain in effect until June 2028. Foreign equivalents of this patent have been issued in Sweden, Netherlands, Great Britain, France, Germany and Canada. The claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,691,608 cover compositions of matter including isolated nucleic acids, expression vectors, bacterial cells that include the nucleic acids, as well as methods of producing truncated Protein A polypeptides, methods of producing affinity chromatography resins, and methods of purifying proteins. 

OPUS 

In January 2012, Repligen filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&#147;USPTO&#148;) which covers certain unique features of our OPUS pre-packed columns. Pending claims that relate to these unique features cover the ease and flexibility of column packing, bed height adjustment and cleaning that is improved over existing pre-packed column designs. In January 2013, we filed an international patent cooperation treaty (&#147;PCT&#148;) application as well as a utility application with the USPTO on the basis of the provisional application. The OPUS pre-packed column patent application is pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Japan. 

ATF Systems 

As part of the Refine Acquisition, Repligen acquired the exclusive rights to an issued U.S. patent (US 6,544,424) covering the Alternating Tangential Flow (ATF) System and a process related to the filtration of biologic fluids from a bioreactor through hollow fiber filters by the action of a diaphragm pump which creates alternating tangential flow through the filter. The patent expires in 2020. Another patent has been issued in the U.S. covering improvements on the original ATF design that include a screen filter module (US 9,050,547). This family of patents and applications has issued or is pending in Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, and Korea. Other additional improvements on the original ATF systems and methods are covered by patent applications pending in one or more of the US, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, and Korea. 

Spinal Muscular Atrophy 

In 2009, Repligen entered into an exclusive license agreement with a non-profit organization, FSMA, now called CureSMA, for worldwide rights to patent applications related to compositions and methods for the 

&#160; 

treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. FSMA had funded the development of these compounds and identified a novel enzyme target (&#147;DcpS&#148;) that these compounds inhibit. In 2011, we were granted U.S. Patent Nos. 7,888,366 and 7,985,755, both entitled &#147;2,4 Diaminoquinazolines for Spinal Muscular Atrophy,&#148; with allowed composition claims that cover both the genus and the species of the chemical structures of the lead clinical candidates. The expiration date of U.S. Patent No. 7,888,366 (the &#145;366 patent) is in 2028 with potential for patent term extension. The expiration date of U.S. Patent No. 7,985,755 (the &#145;755 patent) is in 2027 with potential for patent term extension. U.S. Patent No. 9,067,897, which is a continuation of the &#145;366 patent, was issued in 2015 and expires in 2027. Foreign equivalents of these U.S. patents have been issued and/or are pending in Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. 

Pursuant to the License Agreement, we licensed all of our intellectual property related to SMA to Pfizer and Pfizer has assumed responsibility for maintaining existing intellectual property and prosecuting new intellectual property relating to this program. On January 26, 2015, Pfizer issued to us a notice of its termination of the License Agreement for convenience, effective as of April 26, 2015. 

Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors 

Repligen has entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Scripps Research Institute for worldwide rights to a patent application claiming compounds and methods for treating Friedreich&#146;s ataxia with inhibitors of histone deacetylase. We have extended this original work and filed additional patent applications which claim both methods and compositions for treating Friedreich&#146;s ataxia. We licensed all of our intellectual property related to HDAC to BioMarin and BioMarin has assumed responsibility for maintaining existing intellectual property and prosecuting new intellectual property relating to this program. On January 21, 2014, we out-licensed our HDAC Inhibitor (HDACi) portfolio to BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc. Our out-licensed HDACi portfolio included patent applications in the United States as well as patent applications in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia. Patents, if any, that are granted in the U.S. based on these patent applications are expected to expire from 2029 to 2032. 

Competition 

Our bioprocessing products compete on the basis of quality, performance, cost effectiveness, and application suitability with numerous established technologies. Additional products using new technologies that may be competitive with our products may also be introduced. Many of the companies selling or developing competitive products have greater financial and human resources, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience than we do. They may succeed in developing products that are more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. These competitors may also prove to be more successful in their production, marketing and commercialization activities. We cannot be certain that the research, development and commercialization efforts of our competitors will not render any of our existing or potential products obsolete. 

Manufacturing 

We manufacture seven commercial forms of Protein A including &#147;native&#148; Protein A for life sciences companies including GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma under long-term supply agreements which expire between 2019 and 2021. Native Protein A is manufactured in Sweden, while the recombinant forms are manufactured in Waltham, Massachusetts or in both Waltham, Massachusetts and Sweden. We currently manufacture our growth factor products in Sweden and our OPUS chromatography columns and ATF System products in Waltham, Massachusetts. 

We generally purchase raw materials from more than one commercially established company and believe that the necessary raw materials are currently commercially available in sufficient quantities necessary to meet market demand. However, there are only a limited number of suppliers of materials related to the ATF System products, one of which is the primary supplier of materials used for consumable ATF System products. 

&#160; 

We utilize our own facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts and Sweden as well as third party contract manufacturing organizations to carry out certain fermentation and recovery operations, while the purification, immobilization, packaging and quality control testing of our bioprocessing products are conducted at our facilities. Our U.S. facility, located in Waltham, Massachusetts and our Sweden facility, located in Lund, are both ISO 9001 certified and maintain formal quality systems to maintain process control, traceability, and product conformance. We practice continuous improvement initiatives based on routine internal audits as well as external feedback and audits performed by our partners and customers. In addition, we maintain a business continuity management system which focuses on key areas such as contingency planning, security stocks and off-site storage of raw materials and finished goods to ensure continuous supply of our products.
