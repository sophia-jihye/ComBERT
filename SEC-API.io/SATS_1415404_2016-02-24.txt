 Item 1. &#160; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

EchoStar Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as &#147;EchoStar,&#148; the &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we,&#148; &#147;us&#148; and/or &#147;our&#148;) is a holding company that was organized in October 2007 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada. We are a global provider of satellite operations, video delivery solutions, digital set-top boxes, and broadband satellite technologies and services for home and office, delivering innovative network technologies, managed services, and solutions for enterprises and governments. Our Class A common stock is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) under the symbol &#147;SATS.&#148; 

&#160; 

We currently operate in the following three business segments: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Hughes &#151; which provides satellite broadband internet access to North American consumers and broadband network services and equipment to domestic and international enterprise markets. The Hughes segment also provides managed services to large enterprises and solutions to customers for mobile satellite systems.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; EchoStar Technologies (&#147;ETC&#148;) &#151; which designs, develops and distributes secure end-to-end video technology solutions including digital set-top boxes and related products and technology, primarily for satellite TV service providers and telecommunication companies. Our EchoStar Technologies segment also provides digital broadcast operations, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission services, signal processing, conditional access management, and other services, primarily to DISH Network Corporation and its subsidiaries (&#147;DISH Network&#148;) and Dish Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (&#147;Dish Mexico&#148;), a joint venture we entered into in 2008. In addition, we provide our TV Anywhere technology through Slingbox&#174; units directly to consumers via retail outlets and online, as well as to the pay-TV operator market. Beginning in 2015, this segment also includes Move Networks, our over-the-top (&#147;OTT&#148;), Streaming Video on Demand (&#147;SVOD&#148;) platform business, which includes assets acquired from Sling TV Holding L.L.C. (formerly DISH Digital Holding L.L.C.) (&#147;Sling TV Holding&#148;), and primarily provides support services to DISH Network&#146;s Sling TV&#153; operations. In 2016, we plan to introduce a security and home automation solution provided directly to consumers.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; EchoStar Satellite Services (&#147;ESS&#148;) &#151; which uses certain of our owned and leased in-orbit satellites and related licenses to provide satellite services on a full-time and occasional-use basis primarily to DISH Network, Dish Mexico, United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;) government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers, and private enterprise customers.

&#160; 

Our operations also include real estate and other activities that have not been assigned to our operating segments, including, costs incurred in certain satellite development programs and other business development activities, expenses of various corporate departments, and our centralized treasury operations, including, income from our investment portfolio and interest expense on our debt. These activities are accounted for in the &#147;All Other and Eliminations&#148; column in Note 17 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report. 

&#160; 

In 2008, DISH Network completed its distribution to us of its digital set-top box business, certain infrastructure, and other assets and related liabilities, including certain of its satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, and real estate (the &#147;Spin-off&#148;). Since the Spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have operated as separate publicly-traded companies. However, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction, described in Note 4 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report, DISH Network owns shares of our and our subsidiary&#146;s preferred tracking stock representing an aggregate 80.0% economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of our Hughes segment. In addition, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of DISH Network and EchoStar is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

BUSINESS STRATEGIES 

&#160; 

Capitalize on demand for broadband services . We intend to capitalize on the global demand for satellite-delivered broadband services and enterprise solutions by utilizing, among other things, our industry expertise, technology leadership, satellite capacity, access to spectrum resources, and high-quality, reliable service to continue growth in consumer subscribers and the enterprise market.

&#160; 

Expand satellite capacity and related infrastructure. &#160; We expect that our expertise in the identification, acquisition and development of satellite spectrum and orbital rights and satellite operations, together with existing or acquired infrastructure, will provide opportunities to enter new international markets. We believe market opportunities exist that will facilitate the acquisition or leasing of additional satellite capacity which will enable us to provide services to a broader customer base, including providers of pay-TV services, satellite-delivered broadband, corporate communications, and government services.

&#160; 

Continue development of S-band and other hybrid spectrum resources. We believe we are in a unique position to deploy a European wide mobile satellite service (&#147;MSS&#148;)/complementary ground component (&#147;CGC&#148;) network and maximize the long-term value of our S-band spectrum, in Europe and other regions within the scope of our licenses. We will also continue to explore development of S-band similar spectrum assets in additional international markets,

&#160; 

Exploit our video delivery expertise. &#160; With our extensive experience in designing, developing, and operating video delivery systems for satellite direct-to-home (&#147;DTH&#148;) and internet streaming, we believe we can leverage the broader adoption of advanced technologies such as placeshifting functionality, hybrid internet offerings and other in-home solutions to create opportunities for us. Therefore, we continue to explore opportunities, including partnerships, joint ventures and strategic acquisitions, to expand our existing markets or enter new markets. In addition, we intend to seek opportunities to license our technology to other original equipment manufacturers and pay-TV providers.

&#160; 

Develop improved and new technologies . Our engineering capabilities provide us with the opportunity to develop and deploy cutting edge technologies, license our technologies to others, and maintain a leading technological position in the industries in which we are active. We also intend to develop and launch next generation media and content delivery platforms such as our Move Networks business and our security and home automation products and services.

&#160; 

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

&#160; 

HUGHES SEGMENT 

&#160; 

Our Products and Services 

&#160; 

Our Hughes segment is a global provider of broadband satellite technologies and services for the home and office, delivering innovative network technologies, managed services, and solutions for consumers, enterprises and governments. 

&#160; 

Our Hughes segment uses its two owned satellites, the SPACEWAY 3 satellite and the EchoStar XVII satellite, and additional satellite capacity acquired from multiple third-party providers, to provide satellite broadband internet access to North American consumers, which we refer to as the consumer market, and broadband network services and equipment to domestic and international enterprise markets. Our Hughes segment also provides managed services and equipment to large enterprises and solutions to customers for mobile satellite systems. We incorporate advances in technology to reduce costs and to increase the functionality and reliability of our products and services. Through the usage of advanced spectrally efficient modulation and coding methodologies, proprietary software web acceleration and compression techniques, we continue to improve the efficiency of our networks. We invest in technologies to enhance our system and network management capabilities, specifically our managed services for enterprises. We also continue to invest in next generation technologies that can be applied to our future products and services. Beginning in October 2012, we introduced HughesNet Gen4 satellite broadband internet services to our customers in North America on the EchoStar XVII satellite. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We continue our efforts in growing our consumer revenue, which depends on our success in adding new subscribers on our Hughes segment&#146;s satellite networks. The addition of new subscribers and the performance of our consumer service offering, primarily drive the revenue growth in our consumer business. Service costs related to ongoing support of our direct and indirect customers and partners are typically impacted most significantly by our growth. Long-term trends continue to be influenced primarily by the subscriber growth in our consumer business. 

&#160; 

New satellite launches are expected to provide additional capacity for subscriber growth while we manage subscriber growth across our existing satellite platform. In March 2013, we entered into a contract for the design and construction of the EchoStar XIX satellite, which is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2016. The EchoStar XIX satellite is a next-generation, high throughput geostationary satellite that will employ a multi-spot beam, bent pipe Ka-band architecture and will provide additional capacity for the Hughes broadband services to the consumer market in North America, as well as new capacity covering Mexico and other Latin American countries. 

&#160; 

We continue our efforts in growing our consumer satellite services business outside of the U.S. In April 2014, we entered into a satellite services agreement pursuant to which Eutelsat do Brasil will provide to us fixed broadband service using the Ka-band capacity into Brazil on the EUTELSAT 65 West A satellite for a 15-year term. We expect the satellite to launch in the first quarter of 2016 and to begin delivering consumer satellite broadband services in Brazil in the second half of 2016. In addition, in September 2015, we entered into satellite services agreements pursuant to which affiliates of Telesat Canada (&#147;Telesat&#148;) will provide to us fixed broadband service into South America using the Ka-band capacity on a satellite to be located at the 63 degree west longitude orbital location for a 15-year term. We expect the satellite to be launched in the second quarter of 2018 to deliver consumer satellite broadband services into South America as well as create a platform to potentially allow for further development of our business in South America. 

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

Our Hughes segment delivers satellite broadband internet service to North American consumers. It also provides satellite, network products and services and managed network services and equipment to enterprises and broadband service providers worldwide. In addition, our Hughes segment provides satellite ground segment systems and terminals to mobile system operators. 

&#160; 

In October 2012, we entered into a distribution agreement (the &#147;Distribution Agreement&#148;) with dishNET Satellite Broadband L.L.C. (&#147;dishNET&#148;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of DISH Network, pursuant to which dishNET has the right, but not the obligation, to market, sell and distribute the Hughes satellite internet service (the &#147;Hughes service&#148;) under the dishNET brand. In February 2014, we amended the Distribution Agreement which, among other things, extended the term of the agreement through March 1, 2024. DISH Network accounted for 7.8%, 8.5% and 9.3% of our total Hughes segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our related party transactions with DISH Network. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our Hughes segment had approximately 1,035,000, 977,000 and 860,000 broadband subscribers, respectively. These broadband subscribers include customers that subscribe to our HughesNet broadband services through retail, wholesale and small/medium enterprise service channels. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Hughes segment had approximately $1.44 billion and $1.26 billion, respectively, of contracted revenue backlog. We define Hughes contracted revenue backlog as our expected future revenue under customer contracts that are non-cancelable, excluding agreements with customers in our consumer market. Of the total contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2015, we expect to recognize approximately $402.1 million of revenue in 2016. 

&#160; 

Our Competition 

&#160; 

The network communications industry is highly competitive. As a global provider of data network products and services, our Hughes segment competes with a large number of telecommunications service providers. This increasingly competitive environment has put pressure on prices and margins. To compete effectively, we 

&#160; 

&#160; 

emphasize our network quality, our customization capability, our offering of networks as a turnkey managed service, our position as a single point of contact for products and services and our competitive prices. 

&#160; 

In our consumer market, we compete against traditional telecommunications and wireless carriers, other satellite internet providers, as well as digital subscriber line (&#147;DSL&#148;) and cable internet service providers offering competitive services in many communities we seek to serve. Cost, speed and accessibility are key determining factors in the selection of a service provider by the consumer. Our primary satellite competitor in our North American consumer market is ViaSat Communications, Inc. (&#147;ViaSat Communications&#148;), which is owned by ViaSat, Inc. (&#147;ViaSat&#148;). We seek to differentiate ourselves based on the ubiquitous availability of our service, quality, proprietary technology, and distribution channels. 

&#160; 

In our enterprise market, our principal competitors for the supply of very-small-aperture terminal (&#147;VSAT&#148;) satellite networks are Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd, ViaSat, SageNet LLC, Newtec and iDirect Technologies (&#147;iDirect&#148;). To differentiate ourselves from our competitors, we emphasize particular technological features of our products and services, our ability to customize networks and perform desired development work and the quality of our customer service. We also face competition from resellers and numerous local companies who purchase equipment and sell services to local customers, including domestic and international telecommunications operators, cable companies and other major carriers. 

&#160; 

We believe broadband networks generally have an advantage over terrestrial networks where the network must reach many locations over large distances, where the customer has a &#147;last mile&#148; or a congestion problem that cannot be solved easily with terrestrial facilities or where there is a need for transmission to remote locations or emerging markets. By comparison, ground-based facilities (e.g., fiber optic cables) often have an advantage for carrying large amounts of bulk traffic between a small number of fixed locations. Our relative competitive position is constantly changing as we and our competitors strive to improve our respective positions. While our current competitive position provides us the opportunity to grow our business, we cannot be certain of its continuing effects on our business as our competitors modify or adapt their strategies and service offerings. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Certain products in our Hughes segment are assembled at our facilities in Maryland and we outsource a significant portion of the manufacturing of our products to third parties. We believe that the manufacturing facilities used by our Hughes segment have sufficient capacity to handle current demand. We adjust our capacity based on our production requirements. We also work with third-party vendors for the development and manufacture of components that are integrated into our products. We develop dual sourcing capabilities for critical parts when practical and we evaluate outsourced subcontract vendors on a periodic basis. Our operations group, together with our engineering group, works with our vendors and subcontractors to reduce development costs, to increase production efficiency, and to obtain components at lower prices. 

&#160; 

ECHOSTAR TECHNOLOGIES SEGMENT 

&#160; 

Our Products and Services 

&#160; 

Our EchoStar Technologies business segment provides secure end-to-end video and broadcast technology products and services to businesses and directly to consumers. 

&#160; 

Video Delivery Products and Related Technologies . Our EchoStar Technologies segment designs, develops and distributes a wide range of video delivery products and related technologies that allow consumers to watch and control their subscription and over-the-air (&#147;OTA&#148;) TV programming from inside their homes. Our current video delivery products and related technologies include:

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Set-top boxes . Provides consumers with the ability to access the enhanced picture quality and sound of 4K, high-definition (&#147;HD&#148;) and/or standard definition (&#147;SD&#148;) content, interactive applications, broadband connectivity and Bluetooth audio streaming, depending on the type of set-top box purchased.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; DVR and Whole-Home HD DVR solutions. &#160; Provides customers with the ability to record, replay and store content and multi-room HD content sharing functionality to create a whole-home entertainment experience, including commercial skipping and sideloading technologies.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; TV Anywhere &#147;Placeshifting&#148; Functionality . Provides customers with the ability to watch and control digital television content on a desktop or mobile device via a broadband internet connection. Customers have these abilities when using our set-top boxes as well as our standalone Slingbox units, which are sold directly to consumers via retail outlets and online, as well as to the pay-TV operator market.

&#160; 

In addition to digital set-top boxes, we design and develop related products such as satellite dishes and remote controls. 

&#160; 

Video Broadcast Services . Our EchoStar Technologies segment also provides online video delivery and satellite video delivery for broadcasters and pay-TV operators, including satellite uplinking/downlinking, transmission services, signal processing, conditional access management, and other services, primarily to DISH Network and Dish Mexico. We operate a number of digital broadcast centers in the U.S. Our principal digital broadcast centers are located in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona. We also have multiple regional and micro digital broadcast centers that allow us to maximize the use of the spot beam capabilities of our satellites and our customers&#146; satellites. Programming and other data are received at these centers by fiber optic cable or satellite. The data is processed, compressed, encrypted and then uplinked to our satellites and our customers&#146; satellites for transmission to end-users.

&#160; 

Over-the-Top (&#147;OTT&#148;) Services. &#160; Through our Move Networks division, we have developed and launched a comprehensive OTT SVOD and live linear service platform solution currently utilized by DISH Network&#146;s Sling TV service, which launched in 2015. We continue to develop and enhance the platform for Sling TV to improve the customer experience. We also continue to explore new ways to leverage this technology for other business opportunities.

&#160; 

Other Products and Services. &#160; With our expertise in connectivity, security, and video, we are developing new consumer product and service offerings, including a security and home automation solution that customers can control from their TV or mobile device.

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

The primary customer of our EchoStar Technologies segment is DISH Network. DISH Network accounted for 87.9%, 88.7% and 90.2% of the EchoStar Technologies segment&#146;s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect DISH Network will continue to be the primary customer and the key revenue contributor for our EchoStar Technologies segment. See Note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our related party transactions with DISH Network. We also currently sell our digital set-top boxes to other international DTH satellite and cable providers, including Bell TV, a DTH satellite services provider in Canada, and Dish Mexico, to whom we also provide video broadcast services. 

&#160; 

The number of potential new customers for our set-top box business in our EchoStar Technologies segment is small and may be limited as prospective customers that have been competitors of DISH Network may continue to view us as a competitor due to our common ownership with DISH Network. Our customers face emerging competition from other providers of digital media and potential government action preventing them from using security systems in connection with set-top boxes. In particular, programming offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved. As a result, we expect that demand for our satellite television digital set-top boxes from DISH Network and other customers could decline and we may not be able to sustain our current revenue levels. 

&#160; 

Our Competition 

&#160; 

The video delivery and broadcast, OTT, and security and home automation industries are highly competitive, and market leadership changes frequently as a result of new products, designs and pricing. As we seek to grow our revenue and market share in these industries, we face substantial competition. Many of our primary competitors, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

such as Arris Group, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Technicolor S.A., have established longstanding relationships with their customers. In addition, a number of rapidly growing companies have recently entered the market with offerings similar to our existing and contemplated products. The entry of these new competitors may result in increased pricing pressure in the market. In the video delivery industry, we may also face competition from international developers of digital set-top box systems that may be able to develop and manufacture products and services at costs that are substantially lower than our costs. Furthermore, we depend heavily on our ability to successfully bring advanced technologies to the market, including internet delivery of video content and our Slingbox unit&#146;s placeshifting functionality. 

&#160; 

We believe our use of proprietary technology, together with our in-house engineering expertise, enables us to innovate and bring new features and enhancements quickly to our customers. In addition, our end-to-end video solutions may allow us to provide a more cost-effective solution for a pay-TV operator who may have to negotiate hardware, middleware and a conditional access system separately. We have a long-standing relationship with DISH Network and provide them with technologically advanced set-top boxes, including advanced hybrid satellite and internet protocol over-the-top delivery solutions, Slingbox unit&#146;s placeshifting functionality, and whole-home DVR features. 

&#160; 

As we develop new products and services for the consumer markets, we will compete with numerous established and developing companies who offer similar products, some who will have longstanding distribution outlets and relationships and established brand awareness. Our success will depend on our ability to create distribution channels and establish consumer awareness. 

&#160; 

Our Manufacturers 

&#160; 

Although we design, engineer and distribute digital set-top boxes and other products, we are not directly engaged in the manufacturing process. Rather, we outsource the manufacturing of our products to third parties who manufacture our products according to specifications supplied by us. We depend on a few manufacturers, and in some cases a single manufacturer, for the production of digital set-top boxes and related products. Although there can be no assurance, we do not believe that the loss of any single manufacturer would materially impact our business. Sanmina-SCI Corporation, Shanghai DD&#38;TT Electronic Enterprise Co., LTD and Jabil Circuit, Inc. currently manufacture the majority of our digital set-top boxes and accessories. 

&#160; 

ECHOSTAR SATELLITE SERVICES SEGMENT 

&#160; 

Our Services 

&#160; 

Our EchoStar Satellite Services segment operates its business using its owned and leased in-orbit satellites. We provide satellite services on a full-time and occasional-use basis primarily to DISH Network, Dish Mexico, U.S. government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers and private enterprise customers. We also manage satellite operations for several satellites owned by third parties. Our satellite capacity is currently used by our customers for a variety of applications: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; DTH Services . We provide satellite capacity to satellite TV providers, broadcasters and programmers who use our satellites to deliver programming. Our satellites are also used for the transmission of live sporting events, internet access, disaster recovery, and satellite news gathering services.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Government Services . We provide satellite services and technical services to U.S. government service providers. We believe the U.S. government may increase its use of commercial satellites for homeland security, emergency response, continuing education, distance learning, and training.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Network Services . We provide satellite capacity and terrestrial network services to companies. These networks are dedicated private networks that allow delivery of video and data services for corporate communications. Our satellites can be used for point-to-point or point to multi-point communications.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Customers 

&#160; 

We provide satellite capacity on our satellite fleet primarily to DISH Network, Dish Mexico, U.S. government service providers, internet service providers, broadcast news organizations, programmers and private enterprise customers. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, DISH Network accounted for approximately 86.3%, 84.1% and 74.9% of our total EchoStar Satellite Services segment revenue. We have entered into certain commercial agreements with DISH Network pursuant to which we are obligated to provide DISH Network with satellite services at fixed prices for varying lengths of time depending on the satellite. See Note 19 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this report for further discussion of our related party transactions with DISH Network. While we expect to continue to provide satellite services to DISH Network, its satellite capacity requirements may change for a variety of reasons, including its ability to construct and launch its own satellites. Any termination or reduction in the services we provide to DISH Network may cause us to have unused capacity on our satellites and require that we aggressively pursue alternative sources of revenue for this business. We currently have available satellite capacity. Our other satellite service sales generally are characterized by shorter-term contracts or spot market sales. 

&#160; 

The agreements with DISH Network for the EchoStar I and EchoStar VIII satellites expired pursuant to their terms effective November 2015. In 2016, we expect to retire the EchoStar I and EchoStar VIII satellites. In addition, our agreement with SES Americom Colorado, Inc. (&#147;SES&#148;) for satellite services on the AMC-16 satellite terminated according to its terms in February 2016. The loss of capacity and/or service provided on these three satellites will adversely impact our future revenue, results of operations and cash flow. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our EchoStar Satellite Services segment had contracted revenue backlog attributable to satellites currently in orbit of approximately $1.41 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively. Of the total contracted revenue backlog as of December 31, 2015, we expect to recognize approximately $373.2 million of revenue in 2016. 

&#160; 

Our Competition 

&#160; 

In the fixed satellite services market, our EchoStar Satellite Services segment competes against larger, well-established satellite service companies, such as Intelsat S.A. (&#147;Intelsat&#148;), SES S.A. (&#147;SES&#148;), Telesat, and Eutelsat Communications S.A. (&#147;Eutelsat&#148;), in an industry that is characterized by long-term contracts and high costs for customers to change service providers. Therefore, it is difficult to displace customers from their current relationships with our competitors. Intelsat, SES and other competitors maintain key North American and other international orbital slots that may further limit competition and competitive pricing. 

&#160; 

While we believe that there may be opportunities to capture new business as a result of market trends such as the increased communications demands of homeland security initiatives, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete against our competitors due to their significant resources and operating history. 

&#160; 

OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES 

&#160; 

Our industry is evolving with the increase in worldwide demand for broadband internet access for information, entertainment and commerce. In addition to fiber and wireless systems, other technologies such as geostationary high throughput satellites, low-earth orbit networks, balloons, and High Altitude Platform Systems (&#147;HAPS&#148;) will likely play significant roles in enabling global broadband access, networks and services. We intend to use our expertise, technologies, capital, investments, global presence, relationships and other capabilities to continue to provide broadband internet systems, networks and services for information, entertainment and commerce in North America and internationally for consumers, enterprises and governments. 

&#160; 

We are selectively exploring opportunities to pursue partnerships, joint ventures and strategic acquisition opportunities, domestically and internationally, that we believe may allow us to increase our existing market share, expand into new markets, broaden our portfolio of products and intellectual property, and strengthen our relationships with our customers. We may allocate significant resources for long-term initiatives that may not have a short or medium term or any positive impact on our revenue, results of operations, or cash flow. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In 2012, we acquired the right to use various frequencies at the 45 degree west longitude orbital location (&#147;Brazilian Authorization&#148;) from ANATEL, the Brazilian communications regulatory agency. The Brazilian Authorization provides us the rights to utilize Ku-band spectrum for broadcast satellite service (&#147;BSS&#148;), Ka-band spectrum and S-band spectrum. With regards to the Ku-band BSS spectrum, we continue to pursue various opportunities to support a Brazilian service. We are also exploring options for the Ka-band and S-band spectrums. In April 2014, we entered into an agreement for the construction of the EchoStar XXIII satellite, a high powered BSS satellite, which will use some of the components from CMBStar, a satellite that we suspended construction of in 2008. The EchoStar XXIII satellite is expected to launch in the third quarter of 2016 and will be deployed at the 45 degree west longitude orbital location. 

&#160; 

In December 2013, we acquired 100% of Solaris Mobile, which is based in Dublin, Ireland and licensed by the European Union and its member states (&#147;EU&#148;) to provide MSS and CGC services covering the entire EU using S-band spectrum. Solaris Mobile changed its name to EchoStar Mobile Limited (&#147;EchoStar Mobile&#148;) in the first quarter of 2015. We are in the process of developing commercial services, expected to begin in the second half of 2016, utilizing the operable transponders we own on the EUTELSAT 10A (also known as &#147;W2A&#148;) satellite, along with our EchoStar XXI S-band satellite. We are currently constructing and expect to launch the EchoStar XXI satellite in the second quarter of 2016 to provide space segment capacity to EchoStar Mobile. We believe we are in a unique position to deploy a European wide MSS/CGC network and maximize the long-term value of our S-band spectrum in Europe and other regions within the scope of our licenses. 

&#160; 

In June 2015, we purchased an equity investment in WorldVu Satellites Limited (&#147;OneWeb&#148;), a low-earth orbit satellite company. In addition, our Hughes segment entered into an agreement with OneWeb to provide certain equipment and services in connection with the ground system for OneWeb&#146;s low-earth orbit satellites. 

&#160;

(1) &#160; We entered into satellite services agreements for certain capacity on these satellites once launched, but are not parties to the construction contracts.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

63 West Agreements. &#160; In September 2015, we entered into satellite services agreements pursuant to which affiliates of Telesat will provide to us fixed broadband service into South America using the Ka-band capacity on a satellite to be located at the 63 degree west longitude orbital location for a 15-year term. We expect the satellite to be launched in the second quarter of 2018 to deliver consumer satellite broadband services into South America as well as create a platform to potentially allow for further development of our business in South America.

&#160; 

Satellite Construction &#151; Launch Services Costs. In the third quarter of 2015, we mutually agreed with a vendor to cancel an existing launch services agreement for the launch of the EchoStar XIX satellite. Pursuant to the cancellation, we received a refund of prior payments related to the launch services, and credited the refund amount to construction in progress in the third quarter of 2015. Also in the third quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement with a different vendor to provide for the launch services of the satellite, which is expected to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2016.

&#160; 

AMC-15 and AMC-16. &#160; In August 2014, in connection with the execution of agreements related to the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite, we entered into amendments that extend the terms of our existing agreements with SES Americom Colorado, Inc. (&#147;SES&#148;) for satellite services on the AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites. As amended, the term of our agreement for satellite services on certain transponders on the AMC-15 satellite was extended from December 2014 through the in-service date of the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite and is being accounted for as an operating lease. The amended agreement for the AMC-16 satellite services extended the term for the satellite&#146;s entire communications capacity, subject to available power, for one year following expiration of the initial term in February 2015 and the agreement terminated according to its terms in February 2016.

&#160; 

As a result of anomalies that affected the operation of the AMC-15 and AMC-16 satellites, our monthly recurring payments were reduced under the related capital lease agreements. We have accounted for these lease modifications generally by reducing the carrying amounts of the satellite and related capital lease obligation by the present value of the payment reduction. In such instances where the carrying amount of the satellite had been reduced to zero as a result of accumulated depreciation or impairments, we have recognized the reductions in the capital lease obligations as gains in &#147;Other, net&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized such gains of $4.5 million, zero and $6.7 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Satellite Anomalies and Impairments 

&#160; 

Our satellites may experience anomalies from time to time, some of which may have a significant adverse impact on their remaining useful lives, the commercial operation of the satellites or our operating results. We are not aware of any anomalies with respect to our owned or leased satellites that have had any such material adverse effect during the year ended December 31, 2015. There can be no assurance, however, that anomalies will not have any such adverse impacts in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our in-orbit satellites were to fail. In some instances, anomalies have resulted in impairment losses that materially affected our operating results. As discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, in the second quarter of 2013 we recognized a $34.7 million impairment loss as a result of anomalies affecting the EchoStar XII satellite. 

&#160; 

We generally do not carry in-orbit insurance on our satellites or use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of launch or in-orbit failures because we believe that the cost of insurance is uneconomical relative to the risk of such failures. Therefore, we generally bear the risk of any uninsured launch or in-orbit failures. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing certain portions of our indebtedness, we are required, subject to certain limitations on coverage, to maintain launch and in-orbit insurance for our SPACEWAY 3, EchoStar XVI, and EchoStar XVII satellites. In addition, although we were not required to maintain in-orbit insurance pursuant to our service agreement with DISH Network for the EchoStar XV satellite, we would have been liable for any damage caused by our use of the satellite and therefore we carried third-party insurance on the EchoStar XV satellite until the termination of our service agreement with DISH Network for the EchoStar XV satellite in November 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We evaluate our satellites for impairment and test for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Certain of the anomalies previously disclosed, may be considered to represent a significant adverse change in the physical condition of a particular satellite. However, based on the redundancy designed within each satellite, certain of these anomalies are not necessarily considered to be significant events that would require a test of recoverability. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 

&#160; 

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (&#147;FCC&#148;) for our domestic, as well as some international, satellite and telecommunications operations and equipment businesses. We are also regulated by other U.S. federal agencies, state and local authorities, the International Telecommunication Union (&#147;ITU&#148;), and certain foreign governments, including the EU. In addition, we are also subject to the export control laws and regulations and trade sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries with respect to the export of telecommunications equipment and services. Depending upon the circumstances, noncompliance with applicable legislation or regulations could result in suspension or revocation of our licenses or authorizations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

The following summary of regulations and legislation is not intended to describe all present and proposed government regulation and legislation affecting our business. Government regulations that are currently the subject of judicial or administrative proceedings, draft legislation or administrative proposals could impact us and our industries to varying degrees. The FCC and other regulators from time to time initiate proceedings that could adversely impact our satellite operations, including spectrum usage. Under its Spectrum Frontiers proceeding, the FCC is considering enabling the use of one of our frequency bands, the Ka-band, on a shared basis with 5G services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, potential FCC actions designed to increase competition among set-top box providers and prevent or limit the use of security systems in connection with set-top boxes may result in our customers facing emerging competition from other providers of digital media and lower sales and revenue to us. We cannot predict either the outcome of these proceedings or proposals or any potential impact they might have on the industry or on our operations. 

&#160; 

FCC Regulations Applicable to Our Operations 

&#160; 

FCC Jurisdiction over Satellite and Terrestrial Operations . Non-governmental, including commercial entities, that use radio frequencies to provide communications services to, from or within the U.S. are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Communications Act&#148;). The Communications Act gives the FCC regulatory jurisdiction over many areas relating to communications operations, including:

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the assignment of satellite radio frequencies and orbital locations to specific services and companies, the licensing of satellites and earth stations, and the granting of related authorizations;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; approval for the relocation of satellites to different orbital locations, the replacement of a satellite with another new or existing satellite, and the authorization of specific earth stations to communicate with such newly relocated satellites;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of assignments, licenses, authorizations, and approvals;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; avoiding harmful interference with other radio frequency emitters; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; ensuring compliance with other applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations.

&#160; 

All satellite licenses issued by the FCC are subject to expiration unless extended by the FCC. The term of each of our U.S. direct broadcast satellite (&#147;DBS&#148;) licenses is 10 years, and our U.S. fixed satellite services (&#147;FSS&#148;) licenses generally have 15 year terms. We hold licenses and authorizations for satellite and earth stations as well as other services, including terrestrial wireless services. To obtain and operate under such FCC licenses and authorizations, we must satisfy legal, technical qualification requirements and other conditions including, among other things, satisfaction of certain technical and ongoing due diligence obligations, implementation bonds, annual regulatory fees and various reporting requirements. A license must be obtained prior to launching or operating a satellite. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FCC Jurisdiction over Set-Top Box Operations . Our digital set-top boxes and similar devices must also comply with FCC technical standards and requirements, including accessibility and other requirements. The FCC has specific Part 15 regulations for television broadcast receivers and television interface devices.

&#160; 

Telecommunications Regulation. &#160; Many of the services we provide are also subject to FCC regulation as telecommunications services. For certain services in the U.S., we are required to contribute fees, computed as a percentage of our revenue from telecommunications services to the Universal Service Fund (&#147;USF&#148;) to support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to low-income consumers, high-cost areas, schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. Current FCC rules permit us to pass this USF contribution through to our customers. The FCC also requires broadband internet access and internet telephony service providers to comply with the requirements of the Federal Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (&#147;CALEA&#148;). CALEA generally requires telecommunications carriers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully-authorized surveillance of users of their services. In addition, as a provider of interconnected voice over internet protocol services (&#147;VOIP&#148;), we are required to abide by a number of rules related to telephony service, including rules dealing with the protection of customer information and the processing of emergency calls.

&#160; 

State and Local Regulation 

&#160; 

We are also regulated by state and local authorities. While the FCC has preempted many state and local regulations that would impair the installation and use of VSATs and other consumer satellite dishes, our businesses nonetheless are subject to state and local regulation, including, among others, obtaining regulatory authorizations and zoning regulations that affect the ability to install these consumer satellite earth station antennas. 

&#160; 

International Regulation 

&#160; 

Foreign Administrations&#146; Jurisdiction Over Satellite and Terrestrial Operations . Some of our satellites and earth stations are licensed in foreign jurisdictions. We also have terrestrial authorizations in foreign jurisdictions. In order to provide service to a foreign location from a U.S. satellite, we are required to obtain approvals from the FCC and foreign administrative agencies. The laws and regulations addressing access to satellite and terrestrial systems vary from country to country. In most countries, a license is required to provide our services and to operate satellite earth stations. Such licenses may impose certain conditions, including implementation and operation of the satellite system in a manner consistent with certain milestones (such as for contracting, satellite design, construction, launch, and implementation of service), that the satellite or its launch be procured through a national entity, that the satellite control center be located in national territory, that a license be obtained prior to launching or operating the satellite, or that a license be obtained before interconnecting with the local switched telephone network. Some countries may have restrictions on the services we provide and how we provide them. In addition, certain countries may limit the rates that can be charged for the services we provide or impose other service terms or restrictions.

&#160; 

The ITU Frequency and Orbital Location Registration. &#160; The orbital location and frequencies for our satellites are subject to the frequency registration and coordination process of the ITU. The ITU Radio Regulations define the international rules, regulations, and rights for a satellite and associated earth stations to use specific radio frequencies at a specific orbital location. These rules, which include deadlines for the bringing of satellite networks into use, differ depending on the type of service to be provided and the frequencies to be used by the satellite. On our behalf, various countries have made, and may in the future make, additional filings for the frequency assignments at particular orbital locations that are used or to be used by our current satellite networks and potential future satellite networks we may build or acquire. In the event the international coordination process that is triggered by ITU filings under applicable rules is not successfully completed, or that the requests for modification of the BSS plan regarding the allocation of orbital locations and frequencies are not granted by the ITU, we will have to operate the applicable satellite(s) on a non-interference basis, which could have an adverse impact on our business operations. If we cannot do so, we may have to cease operating such satellite(s) at the affected orbital locations. We cannot be sure of the successful outcome of these ITU coordination processes. We make commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the filing nation in the preparation of ITU filings, coordination of our operations in accordance with the relevant ITU Radio Regulations, and responses to relevant ITU inquiries.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Registration in the UN Registry of Space Objects. &#160; The U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we license satellites are generally parties to the United Nations (&#147;UN&#148;) Convention on the Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (&#147;UN Convention&#148;). The UN Convention requires a satellite&#146;s launching state to register the satellite as a space object. The act of registration carries liability for the registering country in the event that the satellite causes third party damage. Administrations may place certain requirements on satellite licensees in order to procure the necessary launch or operational authorizations that accompany registration of the satellite. In some jurisdictions, these authorizations are separate and distinct, with unique requirements, from the authorization to use a set of frequencies to provide satellite services.

&#160; 

Telecommunications Regulation. &#160; Many of the services we provide are also are subject the regulation of other countries as telecommunications services. For certain services, we may be required to contribute fees to a universal service or other fund to support mechanisms that subsidize the provision of services to designated groups. Many countries also impose requirements on telecommunications carriers to ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to conduct lawfully-authorized surveillance of users of their services. In addition, we are subject to a number of other rules, including rules related to telephony service such as the protection of customer information and processing of emergency calls.

&#160; 

Export Control Regulation 

&#160; 

In the operation of our business, we must comply with all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries. Applicable U.S. laws and regulations include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&#147;ITAR&#148;), the Export Administration Regulations (&#147;EAR&#148;), and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#146;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;). 

&#160; 

The export of certain hardware, technical data, and services relating to satellites and the supply of certain ground control equipment, technical data and services to non-U.S. persons or to destinations outside the U.S. is regulated by the U.S. Department of Commerce&#146;s Bureau of Industry and Security (&#147;BIS&#148;) under the EAR. In addition, BIS regulates our export of satellite communications network equipment to non-U.S. persons or to destinations outside of the U.S. The export of other items is regulated by the U.S. Department of State&#146;s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (&#147;DDTC&#148;) under the ITAR and are subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements. In addition, we cannot provide certain equipment or services to certain countries subject to U.S. trade sanctions unless we first obtain the necessary authorizations from OFAC. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar foreign regulations, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or giving or promising to give anything of value to foreign government officials and other individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining a competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management, hazardous chemicals and product disposal, most significantly the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#147;RCRA&#148;) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (&#147;EPCRA&#148;). Under the RCRA, our Hughes segment is considered a small quantity generator. 

&#160; 

As required by the EPCRA, we file periodic reports with regulators covering four areas: Emergency Planning, Emergency Release, Hazardous Chemical Storage, and Toxic Chemical Release. We maintain small quantities of hazardous materials on our premises and, therefore, have relatively modest reporting requirements under the EPCRA. We are also subject to the requirements of other environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. Additionally, we review Tier II reporting requirements of the Department of Environmental Quality which requires reporting the storage of hazardous materials in large quantities and if they&#146;ve changed from year to year. These are state run programs and each state may have slightly different requirements. 

&#160; 

Our environmental compliance costs to date have not been material, and we currently have no reason to believe that such costs will become material in the foreseeable future. We do not expect capital or other expenditures for environmental compliance to be material in 2016. However, environmental requirements are complex, change 

&#160; 

&#160; 

frequently, and have become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS 

&#160; 

We currently rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, together with licenses, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and technical measures, to establish and protect proprietary rights in our products. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various aspects of our products and services. The duration of each of our U.S. patents is generally 20 years from the earliest filing date to which the patent has priority. We have granted licenses to use our trademarks and service-marks to affiliates and resellers worldwide, and we typically retain the right to monitor the use of those marks and impose significant restrictions on their use in efforts to ensure a consistent brand identity. We protect our proprietary rights in our software through software licenses that, among other things, require that the software source code be maintained as confidential information and that prohibit any reverse-engineering of that code. 

&#160; 

We believe that our patents are important to our business. We also believe that, in some areas, the improvement of existing products and the development of new products, as well as reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how, are important in establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage. We believe, to a certain extent, that the value of our products and services are dependent upon our proprietary software, hardware, and other technology remaining trade secrets and/or subject to copyright protection. Generally, we enter into non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements with our employees, subcontractors, and certain customers and other business partners. Please see Item 3. &#151; Legal Proceedings of this report for more information. 

&#160; 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING 

&#160; 

We have a skilled and multi-disciplined engineering organization that develops our products and services. Our in-house technological capability includes a wide range of skills required to develop systems, hardware, software, and firmware used in our products and services. In addition, we have pioneered numerous advances in the area of wireless communication systems, techniques and methodologies, television broadcasting, video placeshifting, video copy protection, and digital video recording. 

&#160; 

With respect to hardware development, we have skill sets that include complex digital designs, radio frequency and intermediate frequency analog designs, advanced application-specific integrated circuit designs, and sophisticated consumer and system level packaging designs. We also have extensive experience in developing products for high-volume, low-cost manufacturing for the consumer industry, including satellite TV set-top receivers and dual mode satellite and wireless handsets. 

&#160; 

As a complement to our hardware development, we have extensive experience in designing reliable, real time, embedded software systems as part of our communication systems and services offerings. For example, our broadband product line for the enterprise market supports an extensive range of protocols for data communications. Our engineers have also developed many large turnkey systems for our customers by designing the overall solution, implementing the various subsystems, deploying the entire network and user terminals, integrating and verifying the operational system, and ultimately training the customers&#146; technicians and operators. 

&#160; 

Costs incurred in research and development activities generally are expensed as incurred. A significant portion of our research and development costs are incurred in connection with the specific requirements of a customer&#146;s order. In such instances, the amounts for these customer funded development efforts are included in cost of sales. Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 includes research and development costs of approximately $59.2 million, $68.4 million and $65.3 million, respectively. In addition, we incurred $78.3 million, $60.9 million and $67.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for research and development expenses. 

&#160;
