 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Exxon Mobil Corporation was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1882. Divisions and affiliated companies of ExxonMobil operate or market products in the United States and most other countries of the world. Their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products and transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. ExxonMobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals, including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of specialty products. Affiliates of ExxonMobil conduct extensive research programs in support of these businesses. 

Exxon Mobil Corporation has several divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include ExxonMobil , Exxon , Esso, Mobil or XTO . For convenience and simplicity, in this report the terms ExxonMobil, Exxon, Esso, Mobil and XTO , as well as terms like Corporation , Company , our , we and its , are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups of affiliates. The precise meaning depends on the context in question. 

Throughout ExxonMobil&#8217;s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water and ground. These include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil&#8217;s 2015 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil&#8217;s share of equity company expenditures, were $5.6 billion, of which $3.8 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. The total cost for such activities is expected to decrease to approximately $5 billion in 2016 and 2017, mainly reflecting lower project activity in Canada. Capital expenditures are expected to account for approximately 30 percent of the total. 

The energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. There is competition within the industries and also with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers. The Corporation competes with other firms in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate for such purposes. 

Operating data and industry segment information for the Corporation are contained in the Financial Section of this report under the following: &#8220;Quarterly Information&#8221;, &#8220;Note 18: Disclosures about Segments and Related Information&#8221; and &#8220;Operating Summary&#8221;. Information on oil and gas reserves is contained in the &#8220;Oil and Gas Reserves&#8221; part of the &#8220;Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities&#8221; portion of the Financial Section of this report. 

ExxonMobil has a long&#8209;standing commitment to the development of proprietary technology. We have a wide array of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments. Information on Company&#8209;sponsored research and development spending is contained in &#8220;Note 3: Miscellaneous Financial Information&#8221; of the Financial Section of this report. ExxonMobil held approximately 11 thousand active patents worldwide at the end of 2015. For technology licensed to third parties, revenues totaled approximately $158 million in 2015. Although technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of our Company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession. 

The number of regular employees was 73.5 thousand, 75.3 thousand, and 75.0 thousand at years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the Corporation and are covered by the Corporation&#8217;s benefit plans and programs. Regular employees do not include employees of the company&#8209;operated retail sites (CORS). The number of CORS employees was 2.1 thousand, 8.4 thousand, and 9.8 thousand at years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in CORS employees reflects the multi&#8209;year transition of the company&#8209;operated retail network in portions of Europe to a more capital&#8209;efficient Branded Wholesaler model.
