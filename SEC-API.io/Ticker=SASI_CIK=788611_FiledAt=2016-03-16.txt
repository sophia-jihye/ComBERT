 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

Summary 

&#160;

We are a technology company that specializes in the development and commercialization of novel and unique manufacturing and materials technologies. It is the Company's belief that some of these technologies will fundamentally redefine conventional quality assurance and control practices by embedding quality assurance and process control into the manufacturing process in real time. In addition, the Company anticipates that its core technologies will enable its clientele to combine advanced manufacturing quality assurance and control protocols with novel materials to achieve breakthrough product potential in many industries including aerospace, defense, oil and gas, bio-medical and power generation.

&#160;

Certain members of our team are uniquely qualified scientists with broad backgrounds in manufacturing and materials technologies. In the past, these members have worked with some of the largest defense contractors in the world, in such varied projects as next-generation manufacturing systems, advanced reactive munitions, nuclear weapons stewardship programs, and naval nuclear reactor programs.

&#160;

Our current business plan and principal business activities include the continued development of our In-Process Quality Assurance&#8482; (IPQA&#174;) suite of technologies and the commercialization of both our IPQA&#174; and materials-related suite of technologies, with our main focus currently on the 3D Printing (&#34;3DP&#34;) industry and making operational the contract manufacturing business for metal 3DP, which technologies are described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our strategy is to leverage our manufacturing and materials knowledge, experience and capabilities through the following means: (i) identify, develop and commercialize manufacturing and materials technologies designed to improve manufacturing and quality control practices, and create innovative products in a variety of industries; (ii) provide engineering consulting services in respect of our manufacturing and materials technology expertise to third parties that have needs in developing next-generation technologies for materials and manufacturing projects; and (iii) build and run a contract manufacturing division for metal 3DP beginning with our Electro Optical Systems (EOS) GmbH M290 DMLS&#174; (Direct Metal Laser Sintering) (&#34;EOS M290&#34;) state-of-the-art metal printer. We are presently engaged in a variety of activities in which we seek to commercialize technologies and products in the following industry sectors: 

&#160; 1&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Aerospace and defense manufacturing; &#160;

&#183; Oil &#38; Gas and Energy manufacturing; &#160;

&#183; Bio-medical manufacturing; &#160;

&#183; Automotive manufacturing; and &#160;

&#183; Other markets such as firearms and recreational equipment. &#160;

We expect to generate revenues primarily by direct sales and software licensing of our manufacturing and materials technologies to businesses that seek to improve their manufacturing production processes and/or manipulate and improve the most functional characteristics of the materials and other input components used in their business operations. Additionally, we expect to generate additional revenues from our contract manufacturing activities in metal 3DP. We also expect that our continued development of our &#8220;In Process Quality Assurance&#8482;&#8221; or &#8220;IPQA&#174; technology will enable us to finalize our commercialization of this technology for the AM metal market in the remainder of 2016. We plan to assist our commercialization partners with marketing-related activities for those advanced material-related technologies, including our dental implant biomedical prosthetics technology, for which we seek possible commercialization in the future. However, we presently make no sales of our dental implant biomedical prosthetics technology.

&#160;

Our board of directors, management and business advisors comprise scientists and business professionals with extensive experience in the energy and advanced manufacturing and materials technology markets, as well as business operations. These individuals collectively possess over 100 years of experience working in the advanced manufacturing, materials technology and commercial industry space. As such, we believe we possess the resident expertise to provide engineering services and support to companies using our IPQA&#174; software solutions for metal AM. Accordingly, in addition to our primary business focus, we intend to generate revenues by providing such engineering services and support to businesses licensing our IPQA&#174; software technologies.

&#160;

Additionally, our President and Chief Executive Officer has worked at or with the Edison Welding Institute, the United States Department of Energy (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) national laboratories (including the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory) over the last 20 years. Due to his work with the DOE, our President and Chief Executive Officer has developed extensive relationships with the DOE and its network of national laboratories. Accordingly, we expect to leverage these relationships in connection with licensing and developing technologies created at such national laboratories for commercialization in the private sector.

&#160;

The Company acquired Sumner &#38; Lawrence Limited (dba Sumner Associates) in December 2011. Sumner Associates was a private consulting company that provided services to the public and private sector. Sumner Associates was dissolved during fiscal 2014 as the number of its contracts had been reduced due to, among other things, changing funding climates within the DOE.

&#160;

EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGY COMMERCIALIZATION AND MARKET POSITIONING 

&#160;

Since our inception, we have made tremendous progress in bringing early stage technology from scientific concept and curiosity to practical reality, as described below.

&#160;

1. In-Process Quality Assurance&#8482; (IPQA&#174;) for Additive Manufacturing . We believe that &#34;additive manufacturing&#34; (&#34;AM&#34;), also known as 3D Printing, will significantly impact the manufacturing landscape and revolutionize 21st century industry. AM results in very efficient metal utilization for parts made on-demand, and utilizes a wide variety of rapid prototyping methods. As a result of AM, parts can go straight from digital computer designs and 3D computer models to actual, physical parts in a single step. However, there are severe challenges in connection with 3D printing of metal parts. Current manufacturing processes are not capable of making every part right the first time. Also, process consistency and repeatability require further development for metal parts and this is a typical case for emerging technologies. Although many industry experts have lamented that 3D Printing for metal parts is currently a &#8220;black art&#8221; with limited applications, Sigma is developing its IPQA&#174; technology into a breakthrough hardware and software suite of products for AM known as PrintRite3D&#174;, which we expect will fully address some these shortcomings and enable serial production for metals AM technology to be realized sooner than would otherwise be possible given its current state of maturity. PrintRite3D&#174; comprises a suite of software modules that address the three fundamental problems facing metal AM today, namely: assuring the metal integrity or quality of the product; assuring the as-built geometry of the product; and, increasing the productivity or speed of the AM process.

&#160;

&#160; 2&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

2. Contract Manufacturing for Metal Additive Manufacturing . According to the Wohlers 2015 Annual Report, the service provider segment, industry growth in 2014 was an estimated $2.105 billion, an increase of 38.9% from $1.516 billion in 2013. This market segment grew by 26.3% in 2013, 36.4% in 2012, and 30.7% in 2011. Contract manufacturers are still in the early stages of adding metal AM systems to supply production parts to aerospace and industrial original equipment manufacturers (&#34;OEMs&#34;), such as GE Aviation (&#34;GEA&#34;) and Honeywell Aerospace. We believe that most AM machines produced through 2014 are still not well suited for production applications. They have limited feedback measurement and control sensors to guarantee part quality. Some of the latest machines available, such as EOS&#8217;s M290 machine, are beginning to be sold with limited advanced measurement system capability.

&#160;

On December 4, 2015, Moog Inc. (NYSE: MOG.A and MOG.B) announced that it acquired a 70% ownership of Linear Mold and Engineering with an option to acquire the remaining 30%. This recent sale of Linear Mold and Engineering in some respects represents the culmination of strategic acquisitions of what represented the initial service bureau providers of the early 2000's, starting with General Electric Aviation's purchase of Morris Technologies, and its sister company, Rapid Quality Manufacturing, in 2012. As a result, OEMs like Moog, GEA and Honeywell Aerospace seek to build internal capacity while ensuring sourcing for their first generation AM metal parts. While these strategic acquisitions represent an attempt by large OEMs to secure much needed production expertise for first generation AM proprietary components, their second and future generation components will require a capable service provider market base to supply these much needed components. Sigma believes that this service provider market segment represents an opportunity for Sigma to capture significant portions of the growing demand for metal production parts. Accordingly, Sigma acquired its first EOS M290 machine in 2014. Using the highly reliable M280 as its base, the M290 adds improved energy efficiencies, faster build times, and slightly larger build platform capabilities. Through our EOS M290 machine, our customers will gain the benefits of many years of M280-proven applications while accessing the latest in DMLS&#174; technology, as well as receiving parts certifiably produced using our state-of-the-art PrintRite3D&#174; quality assurance technology.

&#160;

3. Biomedical Implant Technology . The Company has developed and demonstrated at a working prototype level the ability to modify the surface of a metal substrate, in this case, a commercially available dental implant made from commercially pure (CP) titanium. The Company does not currently have the resources to continue its commercialization efforts of such technology without the assistance of a partner or licensee.

&#160;

4. Advanced Munitions Technology . The Company has developed and demonstrated at a working prototype level several classes of energetic materials which have structural strength until impact, and then release energy into the target without generating dangerous shrapnel which could fly out of the explosion zone. The Company believes that this selective munitions technology, if commercialized, will enable our forces to engage the enemy without harming civilians and will enable drones to have new strike capabilities. The Company does not currently have the resources to continue its commercialization efforts of such technology without the assistance of a partner or licensee. The Company has licensed the technology to Allotrope Sciences Corporation (&#34;Allotrope&#34;) under an exclusive license agreement with Allotrope entered into in April 2013, pursuant to which we granted Allotrope rights to market and sell Sigma's ARMS&#8482; and BAM&#8482; technologies to U.S. and Foreign Government customers. Allotrope has not made any sales as of the date of this Annual Report.

&#160;

A detailed description of our technologies and business follows:

&#160;

Next-Generation Quality Assurance Solutions for Additive Manufacturing 

&#160; 

The Market 

&#160;

An area of increasing interest in the manufacturing world is AM or 3DP. AM is a method of producing functional parts directly from computer design files without any tooling or other processing.

&#160;

The sale of AM products and services is expected to exceed $7.3 billion worldwide by 2016. The AM industry is expected to more than quadruple to about $12.8 billion by 2018. By 2020, the AM industry is forecasted to exceed $21 billion, all according to Wohlers 2015 Annual Report.

&#160;

Metal parts are a rapidly growing segment of this overall market space as AM or 3D printing moves from just making models to making actual, fully functional parts. Large firms such as Honeywell Aerospace, GEA and Boeing Aircraft Company view AM as an enabling process for many components. A recent report in a series by Deloitte University Press on additive manufacturing published in Fall 2015 titled, &#34; 3D Opportunity For Quality Assurance and Parts Qualification &#34;, states that, &#34;[o]ne of the most important barriers is the qualification of AM-produced parts. So crucial is this issue, in fact, that many characterize quality assurance (QA) as the single biggest hurdle to widespread adoption of AM technology, particularly for metal.&#34; The Company believes that OEM companies such as GE, Honeywell as well as first tier suppliers like Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ: WWD) and Parker Hannifin (NYSE: PH) cannot achieve their long-term AM production goals without advanced quality assurance and control technologies for metal AM parts because current quality control methods are not sufficient to reliably allow cost-effective manufacturing of safety- and performance-critical metal parts. The Company believes that our PrintRite3D&#174; technology would directly address this &#34; important barrier &#34; for metal parts and allow such AM applications to move forward. In response to this need, the Company has experienced an increase in its installed base of PrintRite3D&#174; systems and we are beginning to provide engineering services and support for our PrintRite3D&#174; software licenses for our installed base at GEA, Honeywell Aerospace, Spartacus3D, Additive Industries, Aerojet Rocketdyne, 3D Material Technologies, LLC (&#34;3DMT&#34;), Trumpf Laser and the Edison Welding Institute (&#34;EWI&#34;). 

&#160;

&#160; 3&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As further evidence of the demand for new quality assurance and control methods for safety-critical additive manufacturing metal parts and particularly for aging fleets with severe parts supply issues, the Office of Naval Research held an Industry Day on 28 July 2015 which was attended by large and small defense contractors interested in providing metal AM parts to Navy Depots and Fleet Readiness Centers. The Navy explained its needs and its forthcoming request for proposals for its program titled, &#34; Quality Metal Additive Manufacturing (Quality Made) Enabling Capability &#34;. The proposed program goals are designed to address, in part, the Navy's need for assuring part quality in-situ (real-time), controlling the AM process parameters to control microstructure, volume and geometry, and collecting build data to support rapid qualification and certification for metal AM parts. The Company believes this is precisely the technology that can be provided by our PrintRite3D&#174; technology. There is currently a very limited supplier base providing such value-added, in-process quality assurance for performance and safety-critical metal parts including the OEM AM machine producers. We believe that none are currently capable of addressing the issue of real-time quality assurance and process control ultimately leading to rapid qualification and part certification. Our PrintRite3D&#174; technology is currently a market leader in this area.

&#160;

The Company has ongoing contracts that include a Period 2 project with Honeywell Aerospace funded by the Defense Advanced Projects Agency (&#34;DARPA&#34;) on the application of our PrintRite3D&#174; technology to performance-critical AM metal parts for aerospace. This project is vitally important because it provides an early opportunity to further demonstrate how our IPQA&#174;-enabled PrintRite3D&#174; technology will reduce our customers' reliance on unnecessary post process inspection, ultimately reducing costs and improving quality for AM of highly critical aerospace metal components. Also, Sigma was a participant on a GEA led team of companies and universities, which were awarded a research contract by the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (&#8220;NAMII&#8221; or America Makes) titled, &#8220; In-Process Quality Assurance&#8482; for Laser Powder Bed Production of Aerospace Components&#8221; . The contract has the stated objective of maturing our In Process Quality Assurance&#8482; (IPQA&#174;) technology for aerospace applications by leveraging a development approach incorporating multiple AM OEM machines, multiple superalloys, and multiple product intent aerospace components. The program start was delayed, however it is currently underway and its period of performance is expected to run into early 2017. In support of this effort, Sigma was awarded related contracts from the subcontractor Aerojet Rocketdyne to install one of our PrintRite3D&#174; systems on a Concept Laser M2 metal AM machine at Aerojet Rocketdyne's Canoga Park, California facility, as well as a contract from Honeywell Aerospace to make initial test specimens for reliability and repeatability testing using our EOS M290 AM system. We were also part of a large research team, led by the Edison Welding Institute that was awarded a grant funded by the National Institute of Standards (&#34;NIST&#34;) to ensure that quality parts are produced and certified for use in products made by a variety of industries and their supply chains. The emphasis was on providing tools needed for additive manufacturing applications to progress from prototype to serial production. This program was successfully completed in Fall 2015. Lastly, we are currently a subcontractor to Honeywell Aerospace who was awarded a program in 2015 by America Makes which is designed to address &#34; Design for Additive Manufacturing &#34; (&#34;DFAM&#34;) issues. In support of this program, we will use our EOS M290 AM system to build canonical shapes and mechanical test specimens for evaluation by Honeywell Aerospace. 

&#160;

Technology and Competitive Advantage 

&#160;

The evolution of AM from prototyping to manufacturing in production runs is widely known to be occurring in, and led by, aerospace while also appearing in niche products such as medical appliances and replacement parts of diverse applications, including unavailable parts required by still deployed but aging technologies. A major problem for 3D metal products production-run manufacturing today is that traditional quality systems rely heavily on after-manufacture inspection procedures that lack strong statistical reliability in small lot manufacturing. Post-production non-destructive test instruments from ultrasound to CT Scans are either not effective or not cost efficient on many complex part configurations that take advantage of 3D capability, and in the case of CT scans, are prohibitively expensive for production cost efficiency. The most important feature of Sigma&#8217;s PrintRite3D&#174; is that it develops actionable quality and process control data of manufacturing information in real-time and, when no flaws are detected, can provide manufacturers and their end-users with a part-by-part quality certification backed up by a file of supporting data. 

&#160;

Sigma&#8217;s PrintRite3D&#174; suite, as described below, is composed of hardware, software, data analytics, and proprietary algorithms. The hardware is an array of photodiodes, non-contact pyrometer, and a data processing unit that can be either sold with an AM manufacturing machine unit by an OEM manufacturer or retrofitted on customers&#8217; sites.

&#160;

1. PrintRite3D&#174; SENSORPAK&#8482; &#8211; the auxiliary sensor and hardware kit that sits on every AM machine to collect the data to drive the software.

2. PrintRite3D&#174; INSPECT&#8482; &#8211; software which verifies quality layer by layer. 3. PrintRite3D&#174; CONTOUR&#8482; &#8211; software which assures the as-built geometry. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The following software modules are currently in development:

&#160; &#160; &#160; 4. PrintRite3D&#174; THERMAL&#8482; &#8211; software which predicts the residual stress and distortion in the part. 5. PrintRite3D&#174; ANALYTICS&#8482; &#8211; software that harvests, aggregates, and analyzes big data from in-process and post process data. &#160;

&#160; 4&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The proprietary software and its embedded algorithms process the very substantial quantity of layer by layer data gathered and then informs operators of the Quality Compliance status of each part in a build. Sigma has been aggressive in patent protecting its in depth data analysis and quality algorithms to link its analysis to root cause metallurgy for determining the granular quantification of the part conformance to metallurgical requirements such as tensile strength. Concurrent with assessing the internal quality features of all parts in a build, PrintRite3D&#174; deploys its CONTOUR&#8482; module that measures each part's adherence to the configuration specification of both internal channels and external form. OEM manufacturers as well as control system manufacturers such as Materialise BV or Siemens may use the Sigma data stream to direct machine performance adjustments.

&#160;

Sigma believes that it has developed an essential tool that enables companies using Additive Manufacturing equipment for metal parts to move from prototyping on into production runs by assuring quality in a uniquely reliable and cost effective fashion. Not only does PrintRite3D&#174; enable a single AM machine to operate at very high quality yields, by measuring the product of the manufacturing equipment rather than just the equipment settings, it also is the most reliable method to assure and document uniform quality assurance of a single part's specification being manufactured by factories utilizing a number of different AM machines. Reciprocally, Sigma believes that Additive Manufacturers using equipment without PrintRite3D&#174; will be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in production-run manufacturing for both cost and quality assurance.

&#160;

The Company believes that the broad domain coverage of its PrintRite3D&#174; patents and metallurgical know-how make the licensing of its product suite to be the best means by which Additive Manufacturing OEM equipment manufacturers can offer in-process-quality-monitoring that certifies and documents the quality of all parts that pass continuous inspection. PrintRite3D&#174; provides 3D metal manufacturing equipment makers with a patent protected data configuration of information that the manufacturers may use to adjust controls of their equipment in response to real-time quality information by, for example, by precisely adjusting laser power to sustain manufacturing to design and specification.

&#160;

Sigma appears well positioned to provide the metal AM market a product offering for real-time quality assurance and process control based on our core competency in real-time quality monitoring and process control called PrintRite3D&#174;. Our IPQA&#174;-enabled PrintRite3D&#174; technology appears ideally suited to meet the needs of metal AM at this critical juncture in its development. Our technology will allow metal AM to be used during manufacturing of safety-critical or performance-critical metal parts, such as used in aerospace, defense and biomedical. Currently, these applications are difficult because the part quality cannot be completely guaranteed using today's conventional nondestructive inspection technologies, because using inspection after manufacturing is difficult, costly and does not find all defects of concern. Therefore, we believe that PrintRite3D&#174; will be a vital enabler for metal AM to realize its full potential. Sigma has unique and patent protected offerings in this field. Furthermore, as a greater number of these AM applications could be cloud-based, the PrintRite3D&#174; technology is fully compatible with highly networked, cloud- or web-based implementation &#8211; subject to the data and intellectual property restrictions which may be imposed by some companies for competitive reasons.

&#160;

We believe that Sigma's unique process know how, trade secrets and methodology for implementation of IPQA&#174; for production AM, and U.S. patent awards and patents pending for quality monitoring and process control for processes specifically including AM, along with its PrintRite3D&#174; technology has uniquely positioned Sigma to be a leader in the market space for in-process quality assurance technologies and solutions for metal AM. Our proven, sophisticated and proprietary analysis software has been demonstrated and tested at many manufacturing sites around the world. These demonstrations have served to validate the underlying technology of PrintRite3D&#174; INSPECT&#8482; and SENSORPAK&#8482; software and hardware modules, respectively. In addition, Sigma has strategic relationships with experienced aerospace companies in North America that have assisted in the validation of the underlying technology for our PrintRite3D&#174; software module known as CONTOUR&#8482;.

&#160;

Also, we continue to work with General Electric under our Joint Technology Development Agreement (&#34;JTDA&#34;), dated April 10, 2013, with General Electric to demonstrate and implement our in-process inspection technologies for additive manufactured jet engine components. Lastly, we are continuing to work with Honeywell Aerospace on the separate development of our PrintRite3D&#174; CONTOUR&#8482; software module for metal-based AM under our Trial Evaluation Agreement with Honeywell Aerospace, which sets forth the parties' intent to use Honeywell's Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Center as a beta test site for our PrintRite3D&#174; CONTOUR&#8482; software module. In further support of this effort, in 2015 Honeywell Aerospace installed its second PrintRite3D&#174; system on one of its Concept Laser M2 machines at their Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Center in Phoenix, Arizona.

&#160;

In addition, we have expanded our market presence and associated installed base of PrintRite3D&#174; systems through our Early Adopter Program (EAP) and our OEM Partner Program to include European companies in France, Germany and The Netherlands. These European partners' installations are key to Sigma's long term strategy to broaden its installed base through our EAP program as well as gain market presence though embedded OEM offerings of our PrintRite3D&#174; technology. At this stage in our PrintRite3D&#174; product commercialization efforts, our PrintRite3D&#174; sales reflect the strategic nature of our selective alliance partnerships .

&#160;

&#160; 5&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

PrintRite3D&#174; is uniquely positioned to grow into this market because its technology is agonistic and deployable with all currently known metal AM manufacturing units. Sigma personnel&#8217;s metallurgical expertise combines with the Company's professionally crafted intellectual property protections to make the Company an attractive and largely necessary partner to each of the major AM OEM equipment manufacturers as well as each of the production oriented AM contract manufacturing enterprises.

&#160;

Business Model 

&#160;

Sigma&#8217;s current commercialization strategy for PrintRite3D&#174; products is: (i) enter into early adopter license agreements with high potential future AM equipment manufacturers and complex part AM manufacturing service bureaus; (ii) enter into OEM license agreements for PrintRite3D&#174; with major AM equipment manufacturers; (iii) provide engineering consulting services on manufacturing and materials technology to third parties that have needs in developing next-generation technologies for materials and manufacturing projects; and (iv) build and run a contract manufacturing division for metal AM commencing with Sigma&#8217;s EOS M290. In 2016 and for 3-5 years going forward, Sigma&#8217;s PrintRite3D&#174; technology sales prospects and trends will be asymmetric to the ups and downs of the AM industry&#8217;s sales of manufacturing equipment because the existing manufacturing base of AM machines is so much larger than PrintRite3D&#174;&#8217;s 2015 installed base and because PrintRite3D&#174; will be marketed to both the current installed base of AM manufacturing equipment and to OEM manufactures of new AM equipment coming on-line. Thus, from 2016 through 2019, Sigma expects its sales curve to be steeper and become less volatile than the general industry growth of new AM equipment sales.

&#160;

The Company believes that since PrintRite3D&#174; systems are designed to run on different machine platforms this allows us to maximize our product offering to the entire AM metal market. The target markets include OEMs both on the AM software side such as Materialise BV as well as machine producers, including, but not limited to, EOS, Concept Laser, SLM, Renishaw PLC (LON: RSW), Additive Industries, and Trumpf Laser.

&#160;

We believe another much needed area for AM metal parts manufacturing is in software &#8220;Apps&#8221; for reducing design and development cycle times, saving the end customer time and money. In support of that we have recently announced a Technology Development Agreement with 3DSIM, LLC of Park City, Utah to pursue commercial metal AM software opportunities for rapid qualification and part certification. These software Apps could form the underpinnings and backbone of a conceptual software App known as THERMAL&#8482;. We therefore envision extending our competitive advantage in the future by further developing and offering a PrintRite3D&#174; suite of Apps which would be specifically developed to improve part designs and significantly reduce traditional trial and error design approaches for features such as distortion control.

&#160;

By combining the AM competency of leading OEM manufacturers with Sigma&#8217;s complete systems package of real-time nondestructive inspection technology, a unique product offering will eventually be available to end-users. After installing Sigma&#8217;s complete PrintRite3D&#174; systems package, which includes our ANALYTICS&#8482; database systems package, OEM&#8217;s and principal end users will finally have the ability to address one the most important barriers to qualification of AM parts, i.e., linking of in-process feature data with post-process microstructural and mechanical property data. Finally, utilizing our EAP program as a starting point, &#8216;user&#8217; advisory groups are being formed to facilitate exchange of information, needs, and new developments providing for shared user experiences.

&#160;

Recently, the European Industrie 4.0 group combined forces with the North American Industrial Internet Consortium to take the first steps towards adopting a common vision for the Internet of Things (&#34;IoT&#34;) in the industrial applications space. Sigma is closely monitoring these developments as we formulate our own IoT strategy to ensure that our products and services will be fully compatible with the emerging industry trends.

&#160;

The Company currently has a healthy pipeline of opportunities with US Fortune 500 companies including GE and Honeywell and outside the United States, with large European manufacturers of AM equipment, and in China, with a cadre of AM adopters. The launch of the Company&#8217;s PrintRite3D&#174; Operating Division in August 2015 led to an immediate buildup up in RFQ backlog and pending orders.

&#160;

To summarize, Sigma has formed an operating division focused on real-time, advanced quality assurance solutions for additive manufacturing thereby increasing the value of the AM part.

&#160;

Contract Manufacturing / Service Bureau for Metal Additive Manufacturing 

&#160;

The Market 

&#160;

According to the Wohlers 2015 Report, in 2014 the Additive Manufacturing industry&#8217;s primary and secondary worldwide revenues were $5.75 billion up 31% from 2013 - the largest year-to&#8211;year percentage revenue increase in 14 years. Wohlers forecasts that AM&#8217;s primary revenues alone will top $7.4 billion in 2016. Sigma&#8217;s initial target market within this burgeoning marketplace is the production of metal parts. Currently estimated to be ~15% of the total revenues in the AM markets, the high dollar value of 3D manufactured metal parts is expected to rapidly grow AM metal manufacturing&#8217;s share of total AM revenues as the technology is deployed increasingly away from prototyping and into dedicated production. Extrapolating from Wohlers, this would be an AM metal products market of $4-6 billion in 2020.

&#160;

&#160; 6&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Based on current market demand and growth trends, the contract manufacturing division appears to have the potential to be a significant revenue and profit center even as it also serves Sigma as an on-going research arm for exploring and characterizing new metals for use in all AM metal manufacturing equipment and for staying current on state of the moment 3D manufacturing requirements and thus possible enhancements to PrintRite3D&#174;. A well regarded U.S. Brokerage Firm reported in November 2015 that based upon that month&#8217;s FormNext Trade show in Germany that (AM) &#8220;Metal Demand is extremely strong. SLM Solutions has seen YTD 2015 orders +78% while the value of orders are +115% (so the mix is shifting toward its larger, more expensive units. It believes 2016 can grow nicely on top of this growth. A large private metals OEM expects 2016 unit growth of 30-60%. The booths of metals OEMs were packed. The consensus is that significant runway remains for metal printers.&#8221; The firm went on to assert, &#8220;Metals are robust in 2015, and expected to be again in 2016 as the march to final parts continues.&#8221;

&#160;

As demand continues to increase for prototyping services, contract AM service bureau providers that can deliver low-rate initial production capacity, and as commercial companies in highly-regulated industries begin to gain regulatory acceptance for AM designed parts, there is a burgeoning need for contract manufacturing services to produce these much need metal AM parts. The existing service bureau for AM parts has become much smaller today as a result of the aforementioned merger and acquisition activities since 2012, and what remains is small, fragmented and less capable than the first generation of service bureau providers. Such service bureau also does not currently have the capacity to meet the expected future demand for AM parts in the next 18 to 24 months.

&#160;

Also launched in 2015, Arete-Sigma is a joint venture targeting contract AM manufacturing as it anchors the Company&#8217;s entry into day-to-day AM manufacturing. The Company is continuing to pursue business opportunities related to AM utilizing the Company's EOS M290 or like machines.

&#160;

Technology and Competitive Advantage 

&#160;

We currently have an AM 3D metal printing facility that employs state-of-the-art technology from the leading provider of metal AM systems, i.e., Electro-Optical Systems. While our current printing capacity is limited, we believe that a unique selling point or competitive advantage is our PrintRite3D&#174; technology. Our EOS M290 system is outfitted with our latest PrintRite3D&#174;-enabled technology allowing us to provide customers with the necessary &#34; objective evidence of compliance &#34; , or QA data package, to ensure they can meet compliance with their design intent and ultimately end-user performance requirements for their highly-critical and demanding components .

&#160;

Business Model 

&#160; 

We believe that given the limited service bureau provider capacity due to the merger and acquisition activities in the industry of the past several years, there is now a very real need for AM service providers to allow us to establish an immediate and strong presence and expand into a leading provider of AM produced metal parts.

&#160;

We envision a business model comprising revenues from contract, metal AM manufacturing sales for prototyping services as well as Small Lot Intelligent Manufacturing&#8482; (SLIM&#174;) sales for low-rate initial production (&#34;LRIP&#34;) products requiring our PrintRite3D&#174; technology. The target markets would be end users requiring high-end metal parts such as in the aerospace, oil &#38; gas, bio-medical and automotive markets.

&#160;

To summarize, Sigma has formed an operating division focused on contract additive manufacturing and its AM facility keeps Sigma on the cutting edge of 3D metal additive manufacturing as the Company works with the market to develop state of the moment solutions and to characterize new materials and approaches.

Biomedical Prosthetics, Implants and Munitions Technologies: Next Generation 

&#160;

The Company also has dental and munitions technologies. If we identify suitable licensees or commercialization partners with respect to these technologies, we expect to limit our activities in these areas to marketing assistance.

&#160;

In April 2013, Sigma entered into an exclusive license agreement with Allotrope. Under the agreement, Allotrope is obligated to pay specified license fees and low single digit royalties on sales relating to the licensed patents. The initial term of the agreement is five years, unless sooner terminated as provided in the agreement, which may be renewed by Allotrope for up to three additional periods of one year each after the expiration of the initial term. Additionally, Allotrope may consider sales to system integrators requiring enhancements to current weapons systems where it makes business sense.

&#160;

&#160;

We have not yet identified and may not be successful in identifying a credible commercialization partner for our biomedical prosthetics and implant technology.

Recent Developments (in reverse chronological order) 

&#160;

On March 7, 2016, we announced that we received a contract from Aerojet Rocketdyne, a subsidiary of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AJRD), for a non-exclusive license of the Company's PrintRite3D&#174; software applications. Our technology will be utilized on Aerojet Rocketdyne&#8217;s contract with the U.S. Air Force to define more efficient processes for qualifying AM components, and be evaluated for liquid-fueled rocket engine applications. The broader Air Force initiative is part of a plan to transition away from the Russian-made RD-180 engines currently used on the Atlas V launch vehicle. Separately, we received an order from Aerojet Rocketdyne under the previously-announced &#8220;America Makes&#8221; additive manufacturing research project with GE Aviation. The program, funded by the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII), uses our proprietary In-Process Quality Assurance&#8482; (IPQA&#174;) software for advanced AM monitoring. This is the second PrintRite3D&#174; system being deployed under America Makes, the first being with GE Aviation.

&#160;

On January 27, 2016, we announced that we entered into a technology development agreement with 3DSIM, LLC to pursue commercial metal AM software opportunities for rapid qualification and part certification. 3DSIM, based in Park City, Utah, is a provider of simulation software for metal AM processes.

&#160;

On November 30, 2015, we announced that a company in Germany has entered into an evaluation period for our proprietary PrintRite3D&#174; products. As part of the agreement this customer, which wishes to remain anonymous at the present time, purchased a non-exclusive license to test the Company's PrintRite3D&#174; applications in certain of its laser-based powder bed metal machines &#8211; some of which were on display at the recent Formnext show in Frankfurt, Germany.

&#160;

On September 30, 2015, we announced the launch of our long-awaited CONTOUR&#8482; software &#8211; part of the Company&#8217;s PrintRite3D&#174; family of quality assurance and process control products. Sigma has completed all in-house development and testing such that CONTOUR&#8482; is now available for beta installations, including for customers within the Company&#8217;s Early Adopter Program (EAP). The first fielded application of CONTOUR&#8482; is with Honeywell Aerospace at its AM development facility in Phoenix.

&#160;

On September 17, 2015, we announced the launch of an &#8220;OEM Partner Program&#8221; to expedite the trial and incorporation of the Company&#8217;s PrintRite3D&#174; quality assurance software into AM machines worldwide.

&#160;

On September 11, 2015, we announced that we had entered into an evaluation period for the Company&#8217;s proprietary PrintRite3D&#174; products with Additive Industries of The Netherlands. As part of the agreement, Additive Industries has purchased a non-exclusive license to use one of our PrintRite3D&#174; systems &#8211; including licensing of its INSPECT&#8482;, CONTOUR&#8482; and ANALYTICS&#8482; software &#8211; to be integrated into a MetalFAB1 prototype machine for evaluation purposes. As previously announced, the two companies signed a Technology Cooperation Agreement in December, 2014 to evaluate our technology for Additive Industries&#8217; system development.

&#160;

On September 1, 2015 &#8211; we announced the launch of our EAP to accelerate adoption of the Company&#8217;s groundbreaking PrintRite3D&#174; quality assurance software for 3D printing. We have already won a contract under this initiative &#8211; our EAP &#8211; with Spartacus3D, a unit of France&#8217;s Farinia Group. 

&#160;

On May 4, 2015, we announced that Honeywell has entered into a contract with the Company to acquire our PrintRite3D&#174; system. As part of the award, we delivered and installed our PrintRite3D&#174; INSPECT&#8482; software &#8211; including one license and a year of maintenance &#8211; for Honeywell to test within its AM development facility in Phoenix; the purchase order also included our first contract for our groundbreaking DEFORM&#8482; software.

&#160;

On April 1, 2015, we announced that we became a Silver member of the America Makes consortium to further advance our presence in the 3D printing space, and continue to collaborate with leading companies and organizations in the field.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We believe our technologies will be beneficial to several industries, including aerospace, defense, oil and gas, bio-medical, and power generation. However, developments by others may render our current and proposed technologies noncompetitive or obsolete, or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors. Additionally, our competitive position may be materially affected by our ability to develop or successfully commercialize certain technologies that we have identified for commercialization. Other general external factors may also impact the ability of our products to meet expectations or effectively compete, including pricing pressures.

&#160;

&#160; 8&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We anticipate some of our principal competitors in the United States will include AM End Users, such as GE Aviation, Honeywell Aerospace, Rolls-Royce PLC, Pratt &#38; Whitney; AM OEM equipment manufacturers, such as EOS, Concept Lasers, 3D Systems, Renishaw, Arcam and SLM; third party solution providers like Stratonics Inc., IMPACT Engineering, Inc, Computer Weld Technology, Inc. and Vibrant Corporation that specialize in designing and manufacturing automated welding equipment and quality control monitoring devices used in industrial applications, as well as Aerojet Ordnance, General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems, Alliant Techsystems Inc. and Energetic Materials and Processes, Inc., all of which are businesses focused on developing materials technology solutions in the advanced munitions market; and Straumann AG, BioMet 3I, Keystone Dental, HiOssen Dental, and companies that specialize in developing dental implants that heal rapidly. Most of these competitors have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do, as well as substantially more sales, marketing and financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us. In addition, acquisitions of, or investments in, competing companies by large corporations could increase such competitors&#8217; research, financial, manufacturing and other resources.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company&#8217;s research and development expenses relate to its engineering activities, which consist of the development of our PrintRite3D&#174; quality assurance technologies for specific customers and for the industry in general. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized $330,554 and $219,132, of research and development costs, respectively.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We regard our patents, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, process knowledge, and other intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property law, and confidentiality agreements with employees, partners, and others to protect our intellectual assets. During 2015, Sigma retained the International intellectual property law firm of Kilpatrick Townsend &#38; Stockton LLP to assist the Company with maintaining and extending our ability to have sufficient freedom to operate as well as appropriate patents in place. The below chart summarizes our issued patents. We are currently prosecuting eight foreign and U.S. applications related to our IPQA&#174; technology and rapid qualification of additive manufacturing for metal parts. One of these eight patent applications published in November 2015. There is no guarantee that the patents for which we have applied will offer adequate protection under applicable law.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our business activities are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations are aimed at preventing the inadvertent disclosure of munitions related data or the export of technical knowledge to foreign countries. The work we do with governmental units may also be subject to laws respecting the confidentiality of any classified or national security information we receive during the course of our activities under any government contract.

&#160;

Additionally, with respect to our work with government agencies, our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. U.S. government contracts generally are subject to Federal Acquisition Regulations (&#8220;FAR&#8221;), agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD&#8217;s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, and audit requirements. A contractor&#8217;s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines and could lead to suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. In addition, government contractors are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (&#8220;DCAA&#8221;). These agencies review a contractor&#8217;s performance, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor&#8217;s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor&#8217;s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and information systems.
