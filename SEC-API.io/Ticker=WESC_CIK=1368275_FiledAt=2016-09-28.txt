Corporate Overview 

We were incorporated in Delaware on October 11, 2005. Our principal business was to provide an online financial media outlet for researching China-related stocks. This media outlet provided financial news and commentary, online video broadcasting, and other information for researching China-related stocks. China-related stocks refer to the stocks issued by companies whose main operations are located in China. However, due to our online financial media outlet software problems and other difficulties, we were not able to achieve the milestones we set to fully implement our business operations in online financial media outlet for researching China-related stocks. 

In July 2011, the Company&#146;s new management team began re-evaluating our business plan and determined that it would be in the best interest of the Company to take a new business direction. In the new business model, the Company will serve as an incubator for innovative enterprises across various industries with diverse practices. The Company will identify such enterprises and acquire them through various business combination transactions. As an incubator, the Company will provide the necessary assistance and environment for the acquired businesses to grow with the eventual goal of spinning them off as independent publicly reporting entities. 

The Company has identified the global tourism market as its first investment target. As it currently exists, the tourism industry is fragmented into various geographic regions. We believe that approaching this industry from a global perspective is an emerging market with tremendous growth potential. We plan to set up and/or acquire offices in various regions of the world and through them, develop the local tourism industry and expand our local tourism market. Ultimately, we plan to unify and manage our regional offices and to market our global services through the internet. 

We have three subsidiaries, Airchn Travel Global, Inc. in Seattle, Washington (&#147;ATGI&#148;) and Airchn Travel (Canada) Inc., in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada (&#147;ATCI&#148;) and Airchn Travel (Beijing) Inc. in Beijing, China (&#147;ATBI&#148;). We plan to set up additional subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan and Korea in the near future. We have closed our Beijing office due to lack of business and to reduce operating cost October 1, 2013 but ATBI still exists. 

We are engaged in services such as, airline and cruise ticketing, customized and packaged tours, travel blogs, travel magazines, sales of travel related merchandise, group hotel reservations, business travel arrangements, conference travel arrangements, car rental and admission ticket sale for local tourist attractions. 

We will continue to explore other business growth opportunities, regardless of industry, in order to diversify our business operations and investments. 

In order to reflect our current business plan better, on January 17, 2012, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware to change its name from News of China, Inc. to W&#38;E Source Corp. In connection with the name change, our listing symbol on the OTCQB also changed from &#147;NWCH&#148; to &#147;WESC.&#148; Our new website which is currently under construction can be accessed at www.wescus.com . In addition, the Company also increased its total authorized shares to 500,000,000 to anticipate future financing through the issuance of our equity or convertible debt to finance our business.
