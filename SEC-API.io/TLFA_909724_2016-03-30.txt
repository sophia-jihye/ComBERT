 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

We are a retailer and wholesale distributor of a broad line of leather and related products, including leather, leatherworking tools, buckles and adornments for belts, leather dyes and finishes, saddle and tack hardware, and do-it-yourself kits. We also manufacture leather lacing and some of our do-it-yourself kits. During 2015, our consolidated sales totaled $84.2 million of which approximately 14% were export sales. We maintain our principal offices at 1900 Southeast Loop 820, Fort Worth, Texas 76140. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "TLF." 

Our company was founded in 1980 as Midas Leathercraft Tool Company, a Texas corporation. Midas' original business activity focused on the distribution of leathercraft tools. In addition, the founders of Midas entered into a consulting agreement with Brown Group, Inc., a major footwear retailer, as a result of their proposal to develop a multi-location chain of wholesale stores known as "The Leather Factory." In 1985, Midas purchased the assets related to The Leather Factory stores from Brown Group, Inc., which then consisted of six wholesale stores. 

In 1993, we changed our name to The Leather Factory, Inc. We reincorporated in the state of Delaware in 1994. In 2005, we changed our name to Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. 

Our Development in Recent Years 

We have expanded our wholesale store chain by opening new stores and by making numerous acquisitions of small businesses in strategic geographic locations. In 1996, we expanded into Canada by acquiring our Canadian distributor, The Leather Factory of Canada, Ltd. 

Our retail operations began in 2000, when we acquired the operating assets of two subsidiaries of Tandycrafts, Inc. to form Tandy Leather Company. In 2002, we opened our first retail store under the "Tandy Leather" name. Since 2002, we have acquired or opened 85 retail locations and closed three retail stores, for a net of 82 retail stores. 

In 2008, we began expanding outside of North America by opening one combination wholesale and retail store in Northampton, United Kingdom. By 2009, we operated 30 wholesale stores, 75 retail stores, and one international combination wholesale and retail store. Since 2009, we have closed two wholesale stores, opened nine new retail stores, closed two retail stores, and opened two new international combination wholesale and retail stores. 

At December 31, 2015, we operated 28 stores located in North America operating under the Leather Factory name and 82 stores located in North America operating under the Tandy Leather name, and four combination wholesale and retail stores operating under the Tandy Leather Factory name in the United Kingdom, Australia and Spain. 

Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. wholly-owns eleven subsidiaries which create three operating segments as follows:

(*) The Tandy Leather operation began as a central mail-order fulfillment center in 2000 which was closed in 2002. 

(^) Wholesale store operating as Mid-Continent Leather Sales 

No single customer&#8217;s purchases represented more than 1/2% of our total sales in 2015. Sales to our five largest customers represent 1.3%, 1.7% and 2.5% of consolidated sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Management does not believe the loss of one of these customers would have a significant negative impact on our consolidated operations. 

Our Operating Segments 

We service our customers primarily through the operation of three segments. We identify those segments based on management responsibility, customer focus, and store location. The Wholesale Leathercraft segment consists of 28 wholesale stores of which 25 are located in the United States and three are located in Canada. As of March 1, 2016, the Retail Leathercraft segment consists of 83 Tandy Leather retail stores, of which 76 are located in the United States and seven are located in Canada. Both of these segments sell leather and leathercraft-related products. The International Leathercraft segment consists of all stores, wholesale or retail, located outside of North America. As of March 1, 2016, we had four such stores, two located in the United Kingdom, one located in Australia, and one located in Spain. 

Information regarding net sales, gross profit, operating income, and total assets, attributable to each of our segments, is included within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Note 12, Segment Information, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Wholesale Leathercraft 

The Wholesale Leathercraft operation distributes its broad product line of leather and leathercraft-related products in the United States and Canada through wholesale stores operating under the name, &#8220;The Leather Factory&#8221;. This segment had net sales of $26.8 million, $27.3 million and $27.4 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

General &#160; We operate wholesale stores in 18 states and three Canadian provinces. The stores range in size from 2,350 square feet to 22,000 square feet, with the average size of a store being approximately 5,000 square feet. The type of premises utilized for our wholesale stores is generally light industrial office/warehouse space in proximity to a major freeway or with other similar access. This type of location typically offers lower rents compared to other more retail-oriented locations. 

Business Strategy &#160; Our business concept focuses on the wholesale distribution of leather and related accessories to retailers, manufacturers, and end users. Our strategy is that a customer can purchase the leather, related accessories and supplies necessary to complete his project from a single source. The size and layout of the stores are planned to allow large quantities of product to be displayed in an easily accessible and visually appealing manner. Leather is displayed by the pallet where the customer can see and touch it, assessing first-hand the numerous sizes, styles, and grades offered. The location of the stores is selected based on the location of customers, so that delivery time to customers is minimized. A two-day maximum delivery time for phone, Internet and mail orders is our goal. 

Our wholesale stores serve customers through various means including walk-in traffic, phone, Internet and mail order. We also employ a distinctive marketing tactic in that we maintain an internally-developed target customer mailing list for use in our aggressive direct mail advertising campaigns. We staff our stores with experienced managers whose compensation is tied to the operating profit of the store they manage. Sales are generated by the selling efforts of the store personnel, our direct mail advertising, our website (www.tandyleather.com), and our participation at trade shows. 

Customers &#160; Our customer base consists of individuals, wholesale distributors, tack and saddle shops, institutions (prisons and prisoners, schools, hospitals), western stores, craft stores and craft store chains, other large volume purchasers, manufacturers, and retailers dispersed geographically throughout the world. Wholesale sales constitute the majority of our business, although retail customers may purchase products from our wholesale stores. The Wholesale Leathercraft division&#8217;s sales generally do not reflect significant seasonal patterns. No single customer&#8217;s purchases represented more than 2% of this segment&#8217;s sales in 2015. 

Merchandise Our products are generally organized into 12 categories. We carry a wide assortment of products including leather, lace, hand tools, kits, and craft supplies. We operate a light manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas whose processes generally involve cutting leather into various shapes and patterns using metal dies. The factory produces approximately 20% of our products and also assembles and repackages products as needed. Products manufactured in our factory are distributed through our stores under the Tejas TM brand name. We also distribute product under the Tandy Leather TM , Eco-Flo TM , Craftool TM , and Dr. Jackson's TM brands. We develop new products through the ideas and referrals of customers and store personnel as well as the analysis of fads and trends of interest in the market. 

We offer an unconditional satisfaction guarantee to our customers. Simply stated, we will accept product returns for any reason. We believe this liberal policy promotes customer loyalty. We offer credit terms to our non-retail customers upon receipt of a credit application and approval by our credit manager. Generally, our open accounts are net 30 days. 

During 2015, 2014, and 2013, Wholesale Leathercraft division sales by product category were as follows:

^A concho is a metal adornment attached to clothing, belts, saddles, etc., usually made into a pattern of some southwestern or geometric object. 

In addition to meeting ordinary operational requirements, our working capital demands are a product of the need to maintain a level of inventory sufficient to fill customer orders as they are received with minimal backorders and the time required to collect our accounts receivable. Because availability of merchandise and prompt delivery time are important competitive factors for us, we maintain higher levels of inventory than our smaller competitors. For additional information regarding our cash, inventory, and accounts receivable at the end of 2015 and 2014, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

&#160;

Suppliers &#160; We purchase merchandise and raw materials from approximately 150 vendors dispersed throughout the United States and in approximately 20 foreign countries. &#160; In 2015, our 10 largest vendors accounted for approximately 79% of our inventory purchases. 

Because leather is sold internationally, market conditions abroad are likely to affect the price of leather in the United States. Outbreaks of mad cow and hoof-and-mouth disease (or foot-and-mouth disease) in any part of the world can influence the price of the leather we purchase. Because an occurrence of such an event is beyond our control, we cannot predict when and to what extent we could be affected in the future. Aside from increasing purchases when we anticipate price increases (or possibly delaying purchases if we foresee price declines), we do not attempt to hedge our inventory costs. 

Overall, we believe that our relationships with suppliers are strong and do not anticipate any material changes in these supplier relationships. Due to the number of alternative sources of supply, we do not believe that the loss of any of these principal suppliers would have a material impact on our operations. 

Operations &#160; Hours of operation are 9:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday, and from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm on Saturdays. Our stores are closed on Sunday. The stores maintain uniform prices, except where lower prices are necessary to meet local competition. 

Competition &#160; Most of our competition comes in the form of small, independently-owned retailers who in most cases are also our customers. We estimate that there are a few hundred of these small independent stores in the United States and Canada. We compete on price, availability of merchandise, and delivery time. While there is competition in connection with a number of our products, to our knowledge there is no direct competition affecting our entire product line. Our large size relative to most competitors gives us the advantage of being able to purchase large volumes and stock a full range of products in our stores. 

Distribution &#160; The wholesale stores receive the majority of their inventory from our central warehouse located in Fort Worth, Texas, although occasionally, merchandise is shipped directly from the vendor. Inventory is shipped to the stores from our central warehouse once a week to meet customer demand without sacrificing inventory turns. Customer orders are typically filled as received, and we do not have backlogs. 

We attempt to maintain the optimum number of items in our product line to minimize out-of-stock situations against carrying costs involved with such an inventory level. We generally maintain higher inventories of imported items to ensure a continuous supply. The number of products offered changes every year due to the introduction of new items and the discontinuance of others. We carry approximately 2,600 items in the current lines of leather and leather-related merchandise. All items are offered in all stores. 

Expansion We do not believe there is a significant and immediate opportunity for expansion of the Leather Factory wholesale store system in terms of opening additional locations. 

Retail Leathercraft 

Our Retail Leathercraft segment consists of a growing chain of retail stores operating under the name, &#8220;Tandy Leather.&#8221; Tandy Leather Company, established in 1919 as Hinkley-Tandy Leather Company, is the oldest and one of the best-known suppliers of leather and related supplies used in the leathercraft industry. This retail segment offers a product line of quality tools, leather, accessories, kits, and teaching materials. It had net sales of $53.7 million, $51.8 million and $47.0 million for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

General As of March 1, 2016, the Tandy Leather retail chain has 83 stores located in 37 states and six Canadian provinces. The stores range in size from 1,200 square feet to 9,000 square feet, with the average size of a store being approximately 3,300 square feet. The type of premises utilized for a retail store is generally an older strip shopping center located at well-known crossroads, making the store easy to find. In the past several years, we have relocated some of our smaller stores into larger spaces within the same cities as lease terms expire and appropriate larger space is available at acceptable rates. We expect to limit the number of store relocations in 2016 as we evaluate the benefits gained against the costs of such relocations. 

Business Strategy &#160; Tandy Leather has long been known for its reputation in the leathercraft industry and its commitment to promoting and developing the craft through education and customer development. Our commitment to this strategy is evidenced by our re-establishment of the retail store chain throughout the United States and Canada following our acquisition of the assets of Tandy Leather in 2000. We continue to broaden our customer base by working with various youth organizations and institutions where people are introduced to leathercraft, as well as hosting classes in our stores. 

The retail stores serve walk-in, mail, and phone order customers as well as orders generated from our website, www.tandyleather.com . A two-day maximum delivery time for phone, Internet and mail orders is our goal. Our retail stores are staffed by knowledgeable sales people whose compensation is based, in part, upon the profitability of their store. Sales by Tandy Leather are driven by the efforts of the store staff, trade shows, and our direct mail and e-mail marketing program. 

Customers &#160; Individual retail customers are our largest customer group, representing approximately 60% of Tandy Leather's 2015 sales. Youth groups, summer camps, schools, and a limited number of wholesale customers complete our customer base. Like the wholesale stores, the retail stores typically fill orders as they are received, and there is no order backlog. The retail stores maintain reasonable amounts of inventory to fill these orders. Tandy Leather&#8217;s retail store operations historically generate slightly more sales in the fourth quarter of each year due to the holiday shopping season (28-29% of annual sales), while the other three quarters remain fairly even at 24-25 % of annual sales each quarter. No single customer&#8217;s purchases represented more than 1/2% of Retail Leathercraft&#8217;s sales in 2015. 

Merchandise &#160; Our products are generally organized into 12 categories. We carry a wide assortment of products including leather, hand tools, kits, dyes, and finishes and stamping tools. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Retail Leathercraft division sales by product category were as follows:

As indicated above, the products sold in our retail stores are also sold in our wholesale stores. Therefore, the discussion above regarding products, their sources, and the working capital requirements for the Wholesale Leathercraft division also apply to the Retail Leathercraft division. Sales at the retail stores are generally made through cash transactions or through national credit cards. The retail stores also sell on open account to selected wholesale customers including schools and other institutions and small retailers. Our terms are generally net 30 days. Like the wholesale stores, the retail stores have an unconditional return policy. 

Operations &#160; Hours of operation are 9:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday, and from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm on Saturdays. Our stores are closed on Sunday. Selling prices are uniform throughout the retail store system. 

Competition &#160; Our competitors are generally small local craft stores that carry a limited line of leathercraft products. Several national retail chains, including those that are customers in our Wholesale Leathercraft division, also carry leathercraft products on a very small scale relative to their overall product line. We compete on price, availability of merchandise, and depth of our product line. To our knowledge, our store chain is the only one in existence solely specializing in leathercraft. 

Distribution &#160; The retail stores receive their inventory from our central warehouse located in Fort Worth, Texas. The stores generally restock their inventory once a week with a shipment from the warehouse. Retail Leathercraft&#8217;s inventory turns are higher than Wholesale Leathercraft&#8217;s because the Wholesale Leathercraft calculation includes the central warehouse inventory whereas the Retail Leathercraft calculation includes only the inventory in the Tandy Leather retail stores. 

Expansion We intend to expand the Tandy Leather retail store chain to between 100 and 120 stores throughout North America as it makes financial sense to do so. Of the 82 stores opened as of December 31, 2015, 11 were independent leathercraft stores that we acquired. Separately, these acquisitions are not material. The other 71 stores have been new stores opened by us. 

International Leathercraft 

Our International Leathercraft segment consists of company-owned stores located outside of North America. The first store in this segment opened in the United Kingdom in 2008. As of December 31, 2015, the segment consisted of four wholesale/retail combination stores: two in the United Kingdom, (the newest one having been opened in October 2015), one in Australia and one in Spain. The stores operate under the Tandy Leather Factory trade name. This segment had net sales of approximately $3.7 million, $4.3 million and $3.9 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We intend to open more stores internationally, specifically in Europe, as the opportunities present themselves, but we have not determined a specific time schedule for said openings. 

Business Strategy The business concept for our International Leathercraft division is a blending of our Leather Factory and Tandy Leather business strategies &#8211; the wholesale distribution of leather and related accessories to retailers, manufacturers, and other businesses, as well as the promotion and continuance of leathercraft through education and development of the retail customers. The stores average 7,000 square feet and are located in light industrial areas. We seek to maintain sufficient inventory so that our customers can purchase the leather, related accessories, and supplies necessary to complete their projects from one supplier. The layout of the store is such that large quantities of product can be displayed in an easily accessible and visually appealing manner. The store services walk-in, mail, and phone order customers as well as orders generated from our website, www.tandyleather.com . Sales are driven by the efforts of the store staff, trade shows, and our direct mail and e-mail marketing programs. 

Customers The growing customer base consists of individuals, wholesale distributors, equine-related shops, cobblers, dealers, and retailers dispersed geographically throughout Europe, Australia, and Asia. Retail sales generally occur via cash transactions or through national credits cards. We also sell on open account to selected wholesale customers including dealers, manufacturers, and retailers. Like our North American stores, our international stores have an unconditional return policy. No single customer&#8217;s purchases represented more than 3% of International Leathercraft&#8217;s sales in 2015. 

Our Authorized Sales Center (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) program was developed to create a presence in geographic areas where we do not have a company-owned store. An unrelated person operating an existing business could become an ASC by submitting an application and upon approval, placing a minimum initial order and meeting minimum annual purchase amounts. In exchange, the benefits to the ASC are free advertising in various sales flyers produced and distributed by us, preferred pricing on certain products, advance notice of new products, and priority shipping and handling of orders. We currently have 6 ASC&#8217;s located in Europe. 

Merchandise The products sold in our international stores are also sold in our North America stores. Therefore, the discussion above regarding products, their sources, and the working capital requirements for the Wholesale and Retail Leathercraft divisions also apply here. 

Operations Hours of operation are 9:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through Friday, and from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm on Saturdays. Our stores are closed on Sunday. Selling prices are consistent with our US pricing, adjusted for currency fluctuation. 

&#160; 

Competition &#160; Our competitors are generally small, independently-owned retailers who, in some cases, are also our customers. We compete on price, availability of merchandise, and delivery time. While there is competition in connection with a number of the products we carry, to our knowledge there is no direct competition affecting our entire product line. We believe our ability to stock a full range of products gives us an advantage over most local competitors. 

Distribution The international stores receive the majority of inventory from our central warehouse located in Fort Worth, Texas, although occasionally, merchandise is shipped directly from the vendor. Inventory is shipped from our warehouse to the store several times per month to meet customer demand without sacrificing inventory turns. Customer orders are typically filled as received, and we typically do not have backlogs. 

&#160;

Expansion We intend to expand further internationally by opening additional stores, although the timing of any store openings has not been determined. We intend to grow our customer base throughout Europe as well as other parts of the world to support any such additional stores. &#160;

Additional Information 

Compliance With Environmental Laws &#160; Our compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
