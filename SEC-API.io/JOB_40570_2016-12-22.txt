Recent Developments 

&#160;

On October 9, 2015, the Company filed a certificate of change to our amended and restated articles of incorporation with the Secretary of the State of Illinois to effectuate a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock on a 1-for-10 basis (the &#8220;Reverse Stock Split&#8221;); and increased the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the Company from 20,000,000, post Reverse Stock Split, to 200,000,000 (the &#8220;Capital Increase&#8221;). The Reverse Stock Split and the Capital Increase, were approved by the Company&#8217;s shareholders at an annual meeting held on September 15, 2015. 

&#160;

The Reverse Stock Split became effective with the FINRA as of the open of business on October 9, 2015. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 10 shares of our pre-Reverse Split common stock was combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. No fractional shares of common stock were issued as a result of the Reverse Split.

&#160;

Throughout this annual report on form 10-K, each instance that refers to a number of shares of our common stock, refers to the number of shares of common stock after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split, unless otherwise indicated. 

&#160;

On July 12, 2016, the Company filed an Articles of Amendment to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Articles of Amendment") with the Secretary of State of Illinois to change the name of the Company to "GEE Group Inc." (the "Name Change Amendment"). The Name Change Amendment was approved by the Company's shareholders at the annual meeting held on July 12, 2016, and became effective on July 18, 2016.

&#160;

The Company effected this name change to better reflect the fact that it provides and markets its staffing services under a variety of different trade names and operating brands. The Company's new CUSIP number for the Company's Common Stock, no par value, in connection with the Name Change Amendment is 36165A 201.

&#160;

A form of the Articles of Amendment that was filed with the Secretary of State of Illinois was filed as Exhibit 3.1 to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 14, 2016.

Marketing 

&#160;

The Company markets its services using the trade names General Employment Enterprises, Omni One, Business Management Personnel, Ashley Ellis, Agile Resources, Scribe Solutions Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, Paladin Consulting Inc., Triad Personnel Services, Triad Staffing, Generation Technologies, BMCH, and BMCHPA. As of September 30, 2016, we operated twenty branch offices in downtown or suburban areas of major U.S. cities in ten states. We have one office located in each of Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois and Massachusetts, two offices in each of California, Texas, three offices in Florida and seven offices in Ohio. 

&#160;

The Company markets its staffing services to prospective clients primarily through telephone marketing by its recruiting and sales consultants, and through mailing of employment bulletins which list candidates available for placement and contract employees available for assignment.

&#160;

There was no customer that represented more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenue in fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2015.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The staffing industry is highly competitive. There are relatively few barriers to entry by firms offering placement services, while significant amounts of working capital typically are required for firms offering contract services. The Company&#8217;s competitors include many sole-proprietorship operations, as well as regional and national organizations. Many of them are large corporations with substantially greater resources than the Company.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s professional and industrial staffing services compete by providing highly qualified candidates who are well matched for the position, by responding quickly to client requests, and by establishing offices in convenient locations. As part of its service, the Company provides professional reference checking, scrutiny of candidates&#8217; work experience and optional background checks. In general, pricing is secondary to quality of service as a competitive factor. During slow hiring periods, however, competition can put pressure on the Company&#8217;s pricing.

&#160;

Recruiting 

&#160;

The success of the Company&#8217;s services is highly dependent on its ability to obtain qualified candidates. Prospective employment candidates are generally recruited over the telephone, by the Company&#8217;s employment consultants or through postings on the Internet. For Internet postings, the Company maintains its own web page at www.geegroup.com and uses other Internet job posting bulletin board services. The Company maintains database records of applicants&#8217; skills to assist in matching them with job openings and contract assignments. The Company generally screens and interviews all applicants who are presented to its clients.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 147 regular employees and the number of contract service employees varied week to week from a minimum of approximately 900 to a maximum of 7,100.
