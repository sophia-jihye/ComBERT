 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview

PJT Partners is a global advisory-focused investment bank. Our team of senior professionals delivers a wide array of strategic advisory, restructuring and special situations and fund placement and secondary advisory services to corporations, financial sponsors, institutional investors and governments around the world. We offer a balanced portfolio of advisory services designed to help our clients realize major corporate milestones. We also provide, through Park Hill Group, fund placement and secondary advisory services for alternative investment managers, including private equity funds, real estate funds and hedge funds. PJT Partners was created in October 2015 through Blackstone&#8217;s spin-off of its advisory businesses immediately following their combination with PJT Capital LP, a financial advisory firm founded by Paul J. Taubman in 2013. The new company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;PJT&#8221; on October 1, 2015.

We have world-class franchises in each of the areas in which we compete. Our strategic advisory line of business, established in 1985 with the added complement of PJT Partners&#8217; team of bankers, offers a broad range of financial advisory and transaction execution capability, including mergers and acquisitions (&#8220;M&#38;A&#8221;), joint ventures, minority investments, asset swaps, divestitures, takeover defenses, corporate finance advisory, private placements and distressed sales. Our restructuring and special situations line of business, established in 1991, is one of the world&#8217;s leading advisors in restructurings and recapitalizations, both in and out of court, around the globe. With extensive expertise in highly complex capital structure challenges, our Restructuring and Special Situations Group&#8217;s services include advising companies, creditors and financial sponsors on recapitalizations, reorganizations, exchange offers, debt repurchases, capital raises and distressed mergers and acquisitions. Park Hill Group, our fund placement and secondary advisory line of business, is a world-leading fund placement agent and has provided fund placement and secondary advisory services for a diverse range of investment strategies since its inception in 2005. Moreover, Park Hill Group is the only group among its peers with top-tier dedicated private equity, hedge fund, real estate and secondary advisory groups.

We report the results of these activities in one operating segment. Financial and other information relating to our operating segment, including foreign and domestic operations for each of the last three fiscal years, is further described in Note 16. &#8220;Business Information&#8221; in the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements&#8221; in &#8220;Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this filing.

We believe the success of our business is based on a highly-experienced team and a relentless focus on our core principles: prioritizing our client&#8217;s interests, providing superior client service, developing our long-term relationships and leading with our human and intellectual capital. As of December 31, 2015, our firm had 289 professionals, including 46 partners.

&#160;

Our Market Opportunity 

We intend to grow our revenues by increasing our share of business from existing clients, developing new client relationships as we expand the breadth and depth of our services and enhancing collaboration across the firm to better serve our clients. Our strategy to achieve our growth objectives has four components:

&#160;

&#183; 

Capitalize on Our Expanded Addressable Market. Following our separation from Blackstone we have the ability to compete for strategic advisory and fund placement engagements involving financial sponsors and other clients unhindered by the inherent conflicts associated with operating alongside Blackstone&#8217;s investing businesses. These opportunities would not have been available to us previously due to these conflicts. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Significantly Increase the Breadth and Depth of Our Advisory Franchise. We are focused on expanding our capabilities in areas where a sizable market opportunity clearly exists by hiring expert, top-tier talent to expand into new industry verticals, geographies and product capabilities, which will enable us to offer increasingly comprehensive and valuable solutions to a broader base of clients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhance Collaboration Among our Three Businesses to Better Serve Clients. We operate a scaled, diversified global advisory franchise comprised of complementary businesses, which each share our culture of excellence, teamwork and entrepreneurship. Our partners and team members have relationships with hundreds of corporate executives, board members, financial sponsors and governments as well as expertise in multiple product areas, industry verticals and geographies. By operating in a more integrated and cohesive manner we are able to offer our clients a comprehensive and differentiated suite of advisory services. In addition, our deep networks across our three businesses allow us to connect clients and provide incremental value in helping them meet their strategic objectives. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Remain the Premier Destination for Talent. We will continue to attract best-in-class bankers who want to deliver a broad range of world-class services to their clients around the globe. We offer a unique and compelling proposition to them through our total focus on advisory services; commitment to building a culture of collaboration, character and growth; strong client relationships; deep and exceptional base of talent; and efficient and scalable support infrastructure. 

Our Key Competitive Strengths

We intend to execute on our strategy by capitalizing on the following core strengths of our organization:

&#160;

&#183; 

30 Years New. As the newly independent PJT Partners, we combine three decades of experience and excellence with the energy and enthusiasm of a new firm. We are recognized experts in strategic advisory, restructuring and special situations and fund placement and secondary advisory services. Our teams act as trusted advisors to a diverse group of clients around the world. We provide clients with creative solutions addressing a range of complex strategic and fundraising challenges. The creativity and depth of our advice, and the integrity and judgment with which we deliver it, provide a strong foundation for our new and growing business. The quality of our advice is core to what we do. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Complementary Business Lines. Our firm benefits from having three leading, balanced and complementary businesses. Our unique and diverse portfolio of industry, product and geographical expertise enables us to serve our clients in a differentiated way. Our leading strategic advisory practices allow us to provide best-in-class advice to clients whether they are looking for growth through strategic alternatives, advice in a restructuring or reorganization or access to capital. Our deep networks across businesses allow us to connect clients and help them meet their strategic objectives. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Global Reach and Importance. We have eight offices in five countries around the globe. From those offices, we are able to advise clients on complex problems anywhere in the world. Our partners have decades of experience and long-standing relationships with hundreds of corporate executives, board members, financial sponsors and governments. Their expertise across multiple product areas, industry verticals and geographies are sought by clients in complex, cross-border situations in dozens of countries. Our Park Hill business has generated long-standing relationships across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia that give them unique access to global capital and drives incremental value for our clients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Clients&#8217; Results Are Our Reputation. Our success is built around the trust our clients have placed in us. We work every day to ensure that we are providing cutting edge advice on the critical matters facing our clients. We work to navigate our clients through complex challenges a nd bold opportunities to meet their strategic objectives. Delivering optimal outcomes is what we strive for &#8211; our clients&#8217; results are our reputation. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Cohesive and Collaborative Partnership Culture. We have a cohesive partnership centered around core values including integrity, character and excellence. Our culture provides the ideal environment for idea sharing, collaboration and innovation. Our bankers are encouraged to make frequent client connections and leverage the experience and insights of fellow partners to deliver optimal client service and outcomes. Our culture also fosters retention of top talent and provides a superior platform from which to recruit top bankers at all levels. 

Our Talent

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 353 individuals across eight offices around the world. This includes 289 professionals, of which 46 were partners. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, integrity and cooperation among our employees.

As a global-focused investment bank focused solely on providing innovative services to our clients, our people are our most valuable asset. Our partners average 24 years of relevant experience, which they leverage to provide the highest quality advice across our broad suite of strategic advisory, restructuring and special situations and fund placement and secondary advisory services. Our partners are supported by a first-rate team of professionals and we are committed to developing and maximizing their talent and skills.

Competition

The financial services industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. Our competitors are other investment banking and financial advisory firms. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms and commercial banks. We compete on both a global and a regional basis, and on the basis of a number of factors, including depth of client relationships, industry knowledge, transaction execution skills, our range of products and services, innovation, reputation and price.

We also compete to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our business will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.

Regulation

Our business, as well as the financial services industry generally, is subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and across the globe. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies in the U.S. and the rest of the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. PJT Partners LP, through which strategic advisory and restructuring and special situations services are conducted in the United States, and Park Hill Group LLC, which is an entity within the Park Hill Group fund placement and secondary advisory business, are registered broker-dealers. These registered broker-dealers are subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the SEC, adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities of its member firms, which would include any such registered broker-dealer. State securities regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over any such registered broker-dealer.

Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers and employees. In particular, as a registered broker-dealer and member of a self-regulatory organization, we are subject to the SEC&#8217;s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. Rule 15c3-1 specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer&#8217;s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and various self-regulatory organizations impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC&#8217;s 

uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributin g or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. 

In addition to the regulation we are subject to in the U.S., we are subject to regulation internationally, such as by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong.

PJT Partners (UK) Limited is licensed with the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority and is required to maintain regulatory net capital of &#8364;50,000. PJT Partners (HK) Limited is licensed with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission and is subject to a minimum liquid capital requirement of HK$3 million.

Certain parts of our business are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. Federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage.

The U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers or employees.

Broker-dealers are also subject to regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which impose obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence and other compliance policies and procedures.

Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in certain cases, criminal penalties. In connection with its administration and enforcement of economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, the Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers, designated under programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called &#8220;Specially Designated Nationals,&#8221; or SDNs. Assets of SDNs are blocked, and we are generally prohibited from dealing with them. In addition, OFAC administers a number of comprehensive sanctions and embargoes that target certain countries, governments and geographic regions. We are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions involving any country, region or government that is subject to such comprehensive sanctions.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;) and the UK 2010 Bribery Act (the &#8220;UK Bribery Act&#8221;) prohibit the payment of bribes to foreign government officials and political figures. The FCPA has a broad reach, covering all U.S. companies and citizens doing business abroad, among others, and defining a foreign official to include not only those holding public office but also local citizens acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of foreign government-run or -owned organizations or public international organizations. The FCPA also requires maintenance of appropriate books and records and maintenance of adequate internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Similarly, the UK Bribery Act prohibits us from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage.

Park Hill Group is also affected by various state and local regulations that restrict or prohibit the use of placement agents in connection with investments by public pension funds, including regulations in New York, Illinois and California. Similar measures are being considered or have been implemented in other jurisdictions.

The Spin-off from Blackstone

Overview

On October 1, 2015, we and Blackstone completed a transaction pursuant to which Blackstone&#8217;s financial and strategic advisory services, restructuring and reorganization advisory services and Park Hill Group businesses were combined with PJT Capital and the combined business was distributed to Blackstone&#8217;s unitholders to form PJT Partners, an independent, publicly traded company.

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we refer to this transaction as the &#8220;spin-off&#8221; or the &#8220;acquisition.&#8221; 

In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the &#8220;Separation Agreement&#8221;) and several other agreements with Blackstone related to the spin-off. These agreements set forth the principal transactions required to effect the separation from Blackstone and provided for the allocation between us and Blackstone of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations (including employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) and govern the relationship between us and Blackstone after completion of the spin-off. These agreements also included arrangements with respect to transitional services to be provided by Blackstone to PJT Partners.

Refer to Note 12. &#8220;Transactions with Related Parties&#8221; in the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements&#8221; of &#8220;Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for further information about agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off.

Organizational Structure Following the Spin-Off

In connection with the spin-off, Blackstone underwent an internal reorganization, pursuant to which the operations that historically constituted Blackstone&#8217;s Financial Advisory reporting segment, other than Blackstone&#8217;s capital markets services business, were contributed to PJT Partners Holdings LP, a holding partnership that is controlled by PJT Partners Inc., as general partner. In the internal reorganization, the limited partners of the holding partnerships that owned Blackstone&#8217;s operating subsidiaries (the &#8220;Blackstone Holdings partnerships&#8221;) and certain individuals engaged in our business received Class A common stock of PJT Partners Inc., as well as common units of partnership interest in PJT Partners Holdings LP (&#8220;Partnership Units&#8221;) that, subject to certain terms and conditions, are exchangeable at the option of the holder for cash, or, at our election, for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. In addition, in connection with the spin-off, PJT Partners personnel received various types of awards under the PJT Partners Inc. 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan denominated in shares of Class A common stock of PJT Partners Inc. and partnership interests in PJT Partners Holdings LP.

Prior to the distribution, PJT Partners Holdings LP acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in PJT Capital LP. In connection with the acquisition, Mr. Taubman and the other partners and employees of PJT Capital LP received unvested Partnership Units and other partnership interests in PJT Partners Holdings LP.

Following the internal reorganization and the acquisition, Blackstone distributed on a pro rata basis to its common unitholders, all of the issued and outstanding Class A common stock of PJT Partners Inc. held by it.

Following the spin-off, PJT Partners Inc. is a holding company and its only material asset is its controlling equity interest in PJT Partners Holdings LP, and certain cash and cash equivalents it may hold from time to time as described in &#8220;Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#8212;Dividend Policy.&#8221; As the sole general partner of PJT Partners Holdings LP, PJT Partners Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of PJT Partners Holdings LP and its subsidiaries. The ownership interest of the holders of Partnership Units (other than PJT Partners Inc.) is reflected as a redeemable non-controlling interest in PJT Partners Inc.&#8217;s consolidated and combined financial statements.

Our employees and certain Blackstone executive officers and employees also hold all issued and outstanding shares of the Class B common stock of PJT Partners Inc. The shares of Class B common stock have no economic rights but entitle the holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held, to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and unvested Partnership Units and LTIP Units in PJT Partners Holdings LP held by such holder on all matters presented to stockholders of PJT Partners Inc. other than director elections and removals. With respect to the election and removal of directors of PJT Partners Inc., shares of Class B common stock initially entitle holders to only one vote per share, representing significantly less than one percent of the voting power entitled to vote thereon. However, the voting power of Class B common stock with respect to the election and removal of directors of PJT Partners Inc. may be increased to up to the number of votes to which a holder is then entitled on all other matters presented to stockholders. The voting power on applicable matters afforded to holders of partnership interests by their shares of Class B common stock is automatically and correspondingly reduced as they exchange Partnership Units for cash or for shares of Class A common stock of PJT Partners Inc. pursuant to the exchange agreement. If at any time the ratio at which Partnership Units are exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock of PJT Partners Inc. changes from one-for-one, the number of votes to which Class B common stockholders are entitled on applicable matters will be adjusted accordingly. 

Holders of shares of our Class B common stock will vote together with holders of our Class A common stock as a single class on all matters on which stockholder s are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law. Blackstone&#8217;s senior management, including Mr. Schwarzman and all of Blackstone&#8217;s other executive officers, provided an irrevocable proxy to Mr. Taubma n to vote their shares of Class B c ommon stock for so long as Mr. Taubman is the CEO of PJT Partners Inc. 

We and the holders of Partnership Units also entered into an exchange agreement under which they (or certain permitted transferees) have the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the partnership agreement of PJT Partners Holdings LP, on a quarterly basis, from and after the first anniversary of the date of the consummation of the spin-off (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), to exchange all or part of their Partnership Units for cash or, at our election, for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. The price per Partnership Unit to be received in a cash-settled exchange will be equal to the fair value of a share of our Class A common stock (determined in accordance with and subject to adjustment under the exchange agreement). In the event that PJT Partners Inc. elects to fund cash-settled exchanges of Partnership Units with new issuances of Class A common stock, the fair value of a share of our Class A common stock will be deemed to be equal to the net proceeds per share of Class A common stock received by PJT Partners Inc. in the related issuance. Accordingly, in this event, the price per Partnership Unit to which an exchanging Partnership Unitholder will be entitled may be greater than or less than the then-current market value of our Class A common stock.
