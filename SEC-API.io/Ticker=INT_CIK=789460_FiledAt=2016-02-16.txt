Segments 

We operate in three reportable segments consisting of aviation, marine and land. In our aviation segment, we offer fuel and related products and services to major commercial airlines, second and third tier airlines, cargo carriers, regional and low cost carriers, airports, fixed based operators, corporate fleets, fractional operators, private aircraft, military fleets and to the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and foreign governments as well as intergovernmental organizations. Our marine segment product and service offerings include fuel, lubricants and related products and services to a broad base of customers, including international container and tanker fleets, commercial cruise lines, yachts and time charter operators, offshore rig owners and operators, the U.S. and foreign governments as well as other fuel suppliers. In our land segment, we offer fuel, crude oil, lubricants, natural gas and related products and services to customers including petroleum distributors operating in the land transportation market, retail petroleum operators, and industrial, commercial, residential and government customers. Within each of our segments we may enter into derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations and also to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs. Financial information with respect to our business segments and the geographic areas of our business is provided below and within Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this 2015 10-K Report. 

&#160; 

Aviation Segment 

Our aviation &#8209;related service offerings include fuel management, price risk management, ground handling, 24/7 global dispatch services, and international trip planning services, including flight plans, weather reports and overflight permits. In addition, we offer card payment solutions and related processing services. Because fuel is a major component of an aircraft&#8217;s operating costs, our customers require cost effective and professional fuel services. We have developed an extensive network of third &#8209;party suppliers and service providers that enables us to provide aviation fuel and related services throughout the world. We believe the breadth of our service offering combined with our global supplier network is a strategic differentiator that allows customers to secure fuel and high &#8209;quality services in location s worldwide on short notice. 

We purchase our aviation fuel fro m suppliers worldwide, which may be delivered into our customers&#8217; aircraft or to a designated storage facility located at one of our suppliers &#8217; &#160; locations, pursuant to arrangements with them. Inventory is 

&#160;

purchased at airport locations or shipped via pipelines and held at multiple l ocations for strategic reasons. We also engage in &#160; contract sales, which are sales made pursuant to fuel purchase contracts with customers who commit to purchasing fuel from us over the contract term, and spot sales, which are sales that do not involve continuing contractual obligations by our customers to purchase fuel from us. Our cost of fuel is generally tied to market &#8209;based formulas or is government controlled. 

Marine Segment 

Through our extensive network , we provide our customers with real &#8209;time global market intelligence and rapid access to quality and competitively priced marine fuel 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Our marine fuel - related services include management services for the procurement of fuel, cost control through the use of price hedging i nstruments, quality control, claims management , and card payment solutions and related processing services . 

We serve primarily as a reseller , and accordingly, in those instances we take delivery for fuel purchased from our supplier at the same place and time as the fuel is sold to our customer. We also sell fuel from our inventor y, which we maintain in storage facilities that we own or lease . We also serve as a broker and in those cases we are paid a commission for negotiating the fuel purchase transaction between the supplier and the end user and for expediting delivery of the fuel . 

The majority of our marine segment activity consists of spot sales. Our cost of fuel is generally tied to spot pricing or market &#8209;based formu las or is government controlled. We also contract with third parties to provide various services for our &#160; customers, including fueling of vessels in port s and at sea, and transportation and delivery of fuel and fuel -related products. 

Land Segment 

Our land &#8209;related services include management services for the procurement of fuel and price risk management. &#160; We primarily conduct these activities thr oughout most of the U.S as well as parts of the United Kingdom and Brazil. 

In addition, we offer transaction management services, which include card payment solutions, merchant processing services, payment solutions for tolls across Europe, government payment systems for global fuel procurement and commercial payment programs in the land transportation industry. 

In connection with our f uel marketing activities, we serve as a reseller, and in those instances we purchase fuel from a supplier and contemporaneously resell it to our customers through spot and contract sales. The fuel is generally delivered to our customers directly or to a designated tanker truck loading terminal commonly referred to as &#8220;racks,&#8221; which are owned and operated by our suppliers or other third &#8209;parties. We also maintain inventory in certain strategic locations including pipelines and we transport this inventory by railcar. Our cost of fuel is generally tied to market &#8209;based form ulas. &#160; 

During each of the years presented i n the accompanying consolidated financial statements no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of segment or consolidated revenue. 

Competitors 

We operate globally across industries that are highly fragmented with numerous competitors. Our competitors range in size and complexity from large multinational corporations, principally major oil producers, which have significantly greater capital resources, to relatively small and specia lized firms. We compete with major oil producers that market fuel directly to the large commercial airlines, shipping companies and petroleum distributors operating in the land transportation market as well as fuel resellers. We believe that our extensi ve market knowledge, worldwide footprint, logistics expertise, and the use of derivative contracts to provide fuel pricing alternatives give us the ability to compete with in th ose markets . 

Regulation 

Our current and past activities are subject to substantial regulation by federal, state and local government agencies, insi de and outside the U.S , which enforce laws and regulations governing the transportation, sale, storage and disposal of fuel and the collection, transportation, processing, storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including waste oil and petroleum products. For example, U.S. federal and state environmental laws applicable to us include statutes that: (i) allocate the cost of remedying contamination among specifically identified parties and prevent future contamination; (ii) impose national ambient standards and, in some cases, emission standards, for air pollutants that present a risk to public health or welfare; (iii) govern the management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; and (iv) regulate the discharge of pollutants into waterways. International treaties also prohibit the discharge of petroleum products at sea. The penalties for violations of environmental laws include injunctive relief, recovery of damages for injury to air, water or property, and fines for non &#8209;compliance. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors,&#8221; and &#8220;Item 3 &#8211; Legal Proceedings.&#8221; 

We may also be affected by new environmental laws and regulations that will apply to us or our customers in the future, some of which could increase the cost or reduce the demand for our products and services. For example, due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has finalized rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions by petroleum product suppliers and facilities meeting certain 

&#160;

annual emissions thresholds and to regulate emissions from major sources of GHGs under the Clean Air Act. In other countries, proposed regulations include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Although the ultimate impact of these or other future measures is difficult to accurately predict, they could make our products more expensive or reduce demand for petroleum products, as well as shift demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources. This, in turn, could affect our operations, earnings and competitive position.
