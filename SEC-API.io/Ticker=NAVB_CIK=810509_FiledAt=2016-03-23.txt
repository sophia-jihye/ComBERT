Development of the Business

Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (Navidea, the Company, or we), a Delaware corporation (NYSE MKT: NAVB), is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of precision immunodiagnostic agents and immunotherapeutics. Navidea is developing multiple precision-targeted products based on our Manocept&#8482; platform to help identify the sites and pathways of undetected disease and enable better diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision-making, targeted treatment and, ultimately, patient care.

Navidea&#8217;s Manocept platform is predicated on the ability to specifically target the CD206 mannose receptor expressed on activated macrophages. The Manocept platform serves as the molecular backbone of Lymphoseek &#174; (technetium Tc 99m tilmanocept) injection, the first product developed by Navidea based on the platform. Lymphoseek is a novel, state-of-the-art, receptor-targeted, small-molecule radiopharmaceutical used in the evaluation of lymphatic basins that may have cancer involvement in patients. Lymphoseek is designed for the precise identification of lymph nodes that drain from a primary tumor, which have the highest probability of harboring cancer. Lymphoseek is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in solid tumor cancers where lymphatic mapping is a component of surgical management and for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with clinically node negative breast cancer, melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Lymphoseek has also received European approval in imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with melanoma, breast cancer or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.

Building on the success of Lymphoseek, the flexible and versatile Manocept platform acts as an engine for the design of purpose-built molecules offering the potential to be utilized across a range of diagnostic modalities, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), intra-operative and/or optical-fluorescence detection in a variety of disease states.

Recent preclinical data generated by the Company in studies using tilmanocept linked to a therapeutic agent also suggest that tilmanocept&#8217;s binding affinity to CD206 receptors demonstrates the potential for this technology to be useful in treating diseases linked to the over-activation of macrophages. This includes various cancers as well as autoimmune, infectious, cardiovascular, and central nervous system diseases. Our efforts in this area were further supported by the January 2015 formation of Macrophage Therapeutics, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary that was formed specifically to further explore therapeutic applications for the Manocept platform.

Our focus on development of our proprietary Manocept platform technology further supports the 2014 decision by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors to reduce our support for, while seeking to partner or out-license, our two neurological development programs, NAV4694 and NAV5001. The NAV5001 sublicense was terminated in April 2015.

Other than Lymphoseek, none of the Company&#8217;s drug product candidates have been approved for sale in any market.

A Brief Look at Our History

We were originally incorporated in Ohio in 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1988. From inception until January 2012, we operated under the name Neoprobe Corporation. In January 2012, we changed our name to Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. in connection with both the sale of our medical device business and our strategic repositioning as a precision medicines company focused on &#8220;NAVigating IDEAs&#8221; that result in the development and commercialization of precision diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals.

&#160;

&#160;

Since our inception, the majority of our efforts and resources have been devoted to the research and clinical development of radiopharmaceutical technologies primarily related to t he intraoperative diagnosis and treatment of cancers. From the late 1990&#8217;s through 2011, we also devoted substantial effort towards the development and commercialization of medical devices, including a line of handheld gamma detection devices which was so ld in 2011 and a line of blood flow measurement devices which we operated from 2001 through 2009. 

From our inception through August 2011, we manufactured a line of gamma radiation detection medical devices called the neoprobe &#174; GDS system (the GDS Business). We sold the GDS Business to Devicor Medical Products, Inc. (Devicor) in August 2011. In exchange for the assets of the GDS Business, Devicor made net cash payments to us totaling $30.3 million, assumed certain liabilities of the Company associated with the GDS Business, and agreed to make royalty payments to us of up to an aggregate maximum amount of $20 million based on the net revenue attributable to the GDS Business through 2017. Based on the 2015 GDS Business revenue, we earned royalty payments of $1.2 million which we expect to receive in March 2016. We did not earn or receive any such royalty payments prior to 2015.

Following the sale of the GDS business and the subsequent strategic repositioning as a precision medicines company, the Company in-licensed the two neuro-tracer product candidates, NAV4694 and NAV5001. The Company progressed the development of both product candidates over the course of 2012 through 2014, moving both into Phase 3 clinical trials. However, in May 2014, the Navidea Board announced that, based on its belief that the public markets were not giving appropriate value to its Phase 3 pipeline products and were likely penalizing the Company for allocating resources to these programs, the Company would be restructuring its development efforts to focus on cost effective development of the Manocept platform while it sought development partners for NAV4694 and NAV5001. In April 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Alseres Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alseres) to terminate the NAV5001 sub-license agreement. The Company is currently engaged in discussions related to the potential partnering or divestiture of NAV4694.

In December 2014, we announced the formation of a new business unit, Macrophage Therapeutics, to further explore therapeutic applications for the Manocept platform, which was incorporated as Macrophage Therapeutics, Inc. in January 2015.

Our Technology and Product Candidates

Our primary development efforts over the last few years have been focused on diagnostic products including our now-approved Lymphoseek product, as well as other diagnostic and therapeutic line extensions based on our Manocept platform, while we have sought to partner or divest our two neuro-imaging product candidates. Efforts to partner or divest NAV4694 are still active, while the in-license of NAV5001 we had with Alseres was terminated in April 2015. 

Navidea remains committed to realizing the full potential of Lymphoseek. In mid-2015, we deployed our own field sales force and began implementing a new strategy to accelerate the strong year-over-year growth of this product. The Company believes that the resources being devoted to drive Lymphoseek sales will lead to positive cash flows and profitability. We are focused on expanding the market for Lymphoseek in all relevant markets.

The Company also continues working to establish new sources of non-dilutive funding, including collaborations and grant funding that can augment the balance sheet as the Company works to reduce spending to levels that can be increasingly offset by growing Lymphoseek revenue. In particular, substantial progress on the Manocept platform has resulted in several promising opportunities, including our R-NAV, LLC venture which began in July 2014, the formation of Macrophage Therapeutics, Inc. in January 2015, and Macrophage Therapeutics' research collaboration agreement with BIND Therapeutics, Inc. executed in June 2015.

Lymphoseek &#8211; Regulatory Background 

Lymphoseek is a lymph node targeting radiopharmaceutical agent intended for use in intraoperative lymphatic mapping procedures and lymphoscintigraphy employed in the overall diagnostic assessment of certain solid tumor cancers. Lymphoseek has the potential to provide oncology surgeons with information to identify key predictive lymph nodes that may harbor cancer and to help avoid the unnecessary removal of non-cancerous lymph nodes and the surrounding tissue in patients with a variety of solid tumor cancers. Lymphoseek was approved and indicated for use in lymphatic mapping for breast cancer and melanoma by the FDA in March 2013. In June 2014, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the expanded use of Lymphoseek indicated for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy in head and neck cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. In September 2014, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for use in sentinel lymph node detection in patients with cancer of the head and neck. This designation provides for a seven-year market exclusivity period in this indication as well as certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits and a waiver of filing fees. In October 2014, the FDA approved a second sNDA for lymphatic mapping in solid tumors and added sentinel lymph node detection for breast cancer and melanoma to the approved indications. The FDA also allowed expanded utilization of Lymphoseek with or without scintigraphic imaging, known as lymphoscintigraphy, to enable pre-operative imaging and mapping of lymph nodes to facilitate node localization during surgical procedures. Lymphoseek is now the first and only FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical agent for sentinel lymph node detection and is the only FDA-approved agent for 

&#160;

&#160;

lymphatic mapping of solid tumors. Additional trials, including trials in anal/rectal, endometrial, and cervical cancers, and others in various stages of execution, planning or consideration, are antic ipated to provide additional data to potentially support expansion of the Lymphoseek opportunity. 

We submitted our Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Lymphoseek to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in December 2012. In September 2014, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Lymphoseek for use in the EU in imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes draining a primary tumor in adult patients with breast cancer, melanoma, or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. The CHMP's positive opinion was reviewed by the European Commission (EC), which has the authority to approve medicinal products for use in the 28 countries of the EU and generally follows the recommendations of the CHMP. The EC granted marketing authorization for Lymphoseek in the EU in November 2014. Our partner, SpePharm AG, is currently performing the customary pre-launch market access activities to support commercial launch in the EU later in 2016. Concurrently, we are completing manufacturing validation activities on a finished drug product contract manufacturing facility to support the Company&#8217;s supply chain, primarily in Europe.

Lymphoseek - Clinical Data and Licensing Background 

In January 2015, we announced that an analysis comparing sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy procedures using Lymphoseek (TcTM) + vital blue dye (VBD) to filtered [99mTc] sulfur colloid (fTcSC) + VBD in breast cancer patients was published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology . Results demonstrated that (i) Lymphoseek patients had significantly fewer SLNs removed per procedure (mean TcTM: 1.85 vs. fTcSC: 3.24, p &#60; 0.0001); (ii) proportionally fewer nodes were necessary to detect cancer spread; and (iii) nodes removed using Lymphoseek held greater predictive value for diagnosing the spread of breast cancer to lymph nodes. The study, &#8220; Comparison of [99mTc]Tilmanocept and Filtered [99mTc]Sulfur Colloid for Identification of SLNs in Breast Cancer Patients, &#8221; authored by Anne Wallace, M.D., et. al., at the UC San Diego School of Medicine was published in the January print issue of the journal Annals of Surgical Oncology .

In February 2015, we announced the peer-reviewed publication of results from a Phase 3 clinical trial of Lymphoseek in patients with certain head and neck cancer in the journal Annals of Surgical Oncology . The trial assessed the performance of Lymphoseek-guided sentinel node biopsy against the standard of care, nodal pathology, in planned elective neck dissection. Results demonstrated that Lymphoseek met the primary efficacy endpoint of accurately identifying sentinel lymph nodes in subjects with node-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, as compared to the removal of all lymph nodes during multiple level nodal dissection surgery of the head and neck. Pathology assessment of lymph nodes from the multiple-level nodal dissection surgery is considered the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; to determine the presence and extent of cancer spread. The study, &#8220; [99mTc]Tilmanocept Accurately Detects Sentinel Lymph Nodes and Predicts Pathology Status in Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck: Results of a Phase III Multi-Institutional Trial &#8221; was published as an Online First article in the journal Annals of Surgical Oncology . Data from this study were previously presented in part at the 2013 Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Annual Meeting (Vancouver, British Columbia), at the 2013 American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress (Washington, DC), and at the 6th European Congress on Head and Neck Oncology-2014 (Liverpool, UK).

In June 2015, results of an investigator-initiated, comparative study of Lymphoseek versus fTcSC measuring injection site pain in patients with breast cancer undergoing lymphoscintigraphy were presented at the 2015 Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging conference. The results of the trial, led by Anne Wallace, M.D., professor of surgery at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine, highlighted that fTcSC caused statistically significant greater levels of pain after injection compared to Lymphoseek. The randomized, double-blind clinical trial compared post-injection site pain using fTcSC versus Lymphoseek in 52 [(27) fTcSC and (25) Lymphoseek] breast cancer patients undergoing lymphoscintigraphy. Pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale and short form McGill Pain Questionnaire at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15 and 30 minutes post-injection. Analysis of the data indicates baseline pain scores were similar between groups. At one minute post-injection, patients receiving fTcSC experienced a mean change in pain of 16.8mm (standard deviation (SD) 19.5) compared to 0.2mm (SD 7.3) in the Lymphoseek group (p =0.0002). Overall, patients receiving Lymphoseek experienced statistically significant less change in pain scores compared to patients receiving fTcSC at 1-3 minutes post-injection.

In July 2015, we announced the peer-reviewed publication of data verifying the Lymphoseek CD206-binding mechanism of action in the Journal of Immunology . Strong evidence-based studies demonstrate macrophages are the major target cell and identify CD206, the mannose receptor, as the tilmanocept-binding receptor. CD206 is highly expressed on the surface of tissue macrophages that are known to reside in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) draining a primary tumor.

In August 2015, we announced the publication of the results from an investigator-initiated, comparative study of Lymphoseek versus filtered Tc-99m Sulfur Colloid (fTcSC) measuring injection site pain in patients with breast cancer undergoing lymphoscintigraphy. The paper, titled &#8220;Comparison of Post-injection Site Pain Between Technetium Sulfur Colloid and Technetium Tilmanocept in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy,&#8221; was published online in the Annals of Surgical Oncology and indicated, with patient-reported data, a statistically significant reduction in the level of post-injection associated pain using Lymphoseek 

&#160;

&#160;

compared with use of an fTcSC tracer. The publication included results of the randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing post-injection site pain using fTcSC versus Lymphoseek in 52 [(27) fTcSC and (25) Lymphoseek] breast cancer patients unde rgoing lymphoscintigraphy. Pain was evaluated with a visual analogue scale and short form McGill Pain Questionnaire at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15 and 30 minutes post-injection. Analysis of the data indicated baseline pain scores were similar between groups. At o ne minute post-injection, patients receiving fTcSC experienced a mean change in pain of 16.8mm (standard deviation (SD) 19.5) compared to 0.2mm (SD 7.3) in the Lymphoseek group (p =0.0002). Overall, patients receiving Lymphoseek experienced statistically significant less change in pain scores compared to patients receiving fTcSC at 1-3 minutes post-injection. 

In December 2015, we announced that results from an investigator-initiated imaging study demonstrated Lymphoseek reduced imaging time by more than 50% in SLN biopsy procedures in malignant melanoma compared to Tc99m sulfur colloid (SC). This finding suggests hospitals and oncology treatment teams can achieve greater patient throughput and workflow efficiencies utilizing Lymphoseek. Results of the study, conducted at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals and led by Charles M. Intenzo, M.D., Professor of Radiology, Director, Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging in the Department of Radiology, were presented at the Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting (RSNA 2015) in Chicago, Illinois. A total of 34 consecutive patients with malignant melanoma underwent SLN mapping with Lymphoseek. Patients received the Lymphoseek dose in 4 intradermal administrations around the tumor site. Images were acquired at intervals up to 40 minutes after injection, which is the department&#8217;s standard-of-care protocol used for SC procedures. This site&#8217;s previous experience showed that SC injections required 40 to 45 minutes after injection for visualization of all lymph nodes in patients with malignant melanoma. Using Lymphoseek, the results show that in all 34 patients, all lymph nodes seen in the final 40-minute image were identified in the 20-minute image, providing rapid and stable localization and identification of the sentinel nodes. The study concludes that in malignant melanoma, SLN mapping with Lymphoseek involves a total imaging time of 20 minutes which is one-half of the time required for SC. From a clinical perspective, the authors conclude that utilizing Lymphoseek is more time-efficient than SC by facilitating patient throughput and expediting subsequent transport to the operating room.

Also in December 2015, we announced that results from an investigator-initiated retrospective analysis demonstrated Lymphoseek was successful in lymph node identification rate, node-positivity rate, and number of total nodes evaluated in SLN biopsy procedures in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAT) compared to patients undergoing initial surgical treatment. These findings suggest that Lymphoseek offers breast surgeons the confidence to specifically identify and remove sentinel lymph nodes in this patient population. Results of the study conducted at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, led by Anne Wallace M.D., Professor of Surgery, and Jonathan Unkart, M.D., Department of Surgery, UC San Diego Health, were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Conference in San Antonio, Texas. The aim of the study was to compare identification rate, node-positivity rate and total number of nodes evaluated during SLN biopsy with Lymphoseek and VBD in clinically node-negative patients receiving neoadjuvant endocrine or chemotherapy versus initial surgical treatment. A retrospective review of patients undergoing SLN biopsy with Lymphoseek plus VBD from May 2013-2015 at UCSD was conducted. Of the 417 total SLN cases identified, 72 (17.2%) cases were in patients who had received NAT (61- chemo, 11- endocrine). The SLN identification rate was 100% in both groups (p=1.0). Overall, there were 68 (16.3%) cases of SLN-positivity, 14 (19.4%) in the NAT group versus 54 (15.7%) in the non-NAT group (p= 0.54). The median number of identified nodes was 3 in both groups. In the a zero-truncated negative binomial count model, age, surgeon and evaluating pathologist were significant predictors of the total number of SLNs evaluated. The use of NAT did not significantly affect the number of SLNs evaluated. These findings show Lymphoseek&#8217;s usefulness in the complicated NAT population and that the outcomes are not different from the standard breast cancer population. This analysis provides compelling evidence that Lymphoseek was successfully used for SLN biopsy in the breast cancer NAT population and could potentially reduce the necessity for unnecessary and morbid axillary dissections, and improve the quality of life for patients.

In January 2016, we announced that the first pediatric patient was enrolled in a clinical study comparing Lymphoseek and VBD in a pediatric population of patients with melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or other solid tumors. The study is designed to investigate how Lymphoseek compares with VBD in identifying lymph nodes as well as evaluate safety and tolerability in the pediatric population. Lymphoseek is currently approved for adult use only. Enrollment is currently planned at approximately six sites throughout the U.S. The first patient was enrolled by Jennifer Aldrink, M.D., Assistant Professor of Clinical Surgery at The Ohio State University College of Medicine and Director of Surgical Oncology, Division of Pediatric Surgery at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Primary goals of this prospective, open-label, multicenter study are to evaluate safety and tolerability of Lymphoseek in this subject population and determine the concordance of in vivo detection rates of Lymphoseek and of VBD in tissue excised and histologically confirmed as lymph nodes. In addition, the study will measure other efficacy signals including assessment of the identified lymph node(s) to confirm: the presence/absence of tumor metastases; agent localization per tumor type; degree of localization (nodes per subject both intraoperatively and with preoperative SPECT/CT); reverse concordance parameters; change of subject stage based on histopathology and descriptive assessment on change in treatment plan; and number of lymph nodes detected with Lymphoseek intraoperatively compared with preoperative SPECT/CT imaging.

In February 2016, we announced enrollment of the first patient in a clinical study evaluating Lymphoseek in women with known cervical cancer. The study, funded by a Fast Track grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), will assess the use of Lymphoseek in SLN biopsy during cervical cancer surgery in support of the existing Lymphoseek label in lymphatic mapping. 

&#160;

&#160;

Enrollment is currently planned in up to six sites throughout the U.S. The first patient was enrolled by Michael M. Frumovi tz, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor, Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine, principal investigator at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. This multi-center, prospective, open-label study intends to enroll up to 40 wo men with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics IA2-IIA1 staging. Subjects will receive a single dose of Lymphoseek administered peritumorally approximately 1-2 hours before surgery. The results will report per-patient false negative rates and compare the pathology status of Lymphoseek-identified sentinel lymph nodes relative to the pathology status of non-sentinel lymph nodes in nodal staging of patients. Additionally, the study will report sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accu racy. 

Manocept Platform - Diagnostics and Therapeutics Background 

Navidea&#8217;s Manocept platform is predicated on the ability to specifically target the CD206 mannose receptor expressed on activated macrophages. Activated macrophages play important roles in many disease states and are an emerging target in many diseases where diagnostic uncertainty exists. This flexible and versatile platform serves as an engine for purpose-built molecules that may significantly impact patient care by providing enhanced diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision-making, and target-specific treatment. This disease-targeted drug platform provides the capability to utilize a breadth of diagnostic modalities, including SPECT, PET, intra-operative and/or optical-fluorescence detection, as well as delivery of therapeutic compounds that target macrophages, and their role in a variety of immune- and inflammation-based disorders. The Company&#8217;s FDA-approved sentinel node/lymphatic mapping agent, Lymphoseek, is representative of the ability to successfully exploit this mechanism to develop powerful new products.

Impairment of the macrophage-driven disease mechanisms is an area of increasing focus in medicine. The number of people affected by all the inflammatory diseases combined is estimated at more than 40 million in the United States and perhaps 700 million worldwide, making macrophage-mediated diseases an area of remarkable clinical importance. There are many recognized disorders having macrophage involvement, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atherosclerosis/vulnerable plaque, Crohn&#8217;s disease, systemic lupus erythematosis, Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma (KS), and others that span clinical areas in oncology, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, cardiology, central nervous system (CNS) diseases, and inflammation. Data from studies using agents from the Manocept platform in RA, KS and tuberculosis (TB) were published in a special supplement, Nature Outlook: Medical Imaging , in Nature&#8217;s October 31, 2013 issue. The supplement included a White Paper by Navidea entitled &#8220; Innovations in receptor-targeted precision imaging at Navidea: Diagnosis up close and personal ,&#8221; focused on the Manocept platform.

Manocept Platform - Diagnostics Clinical Data 

In February 2014, data utilizing compounds from our Manocept platform in models of RA were presented by representatives from The Ohio State University at a Keystone Symposia on Molecular Cell Biology of Macrophages in Human Disease. The studies demonstrate the ability of fluorescent Cy3-tilmanocept to identify and localize to disease-state macrophages when administered intravenously, enabling detection of immune-mediated arthritis in affected joints in vivo in mice. Results were confirmed using histopathology. The data highlighted the identification of immune-mediated inflammation seen in arthritic joints of arthritis-affected mice but not in control mice or un-affected joints within arthritis-affected mice. The imaging results in this study showed preferential localization of macrophages by Cy3-tilmanocept in affected joints with little to no localization in unaffected joints.

In April 2014, collaborators from the University of California, San Francisco presented results at the 2014 American Association for Cancer Research conference, highlighting the potential utility of imaging agents derived from the Manocept platform in identifying affected tissues and lymph nodes in patients with KS. The investigators concluded that, based on the results obtained, labeled imaging agents from the CD206-targeting Manocept platform provide potential avenues to enhance diagnosis and staging in this disorder.

In July 2014, Navidea announced that it formed a joint enterprise with Essex Woodlands-backed Rheumco, LLC, to develop and commercialize radiolabeled diagnostic and therapeutic products for rheumatologic and arthritic diseases. The joint enterprise, called R-NAV, LLC (R-NAV), will combine Navidea&#8217;s proprietary Manocept CD206 macrophage targeting platform and Rheumco&#8217;s proprietary Tin-117m radioisotope technology to focus on leveraging the platforms across several indications with high unmet medical need.

Also in July 2014, the Company completed a license agreement with UCSD for the exclusive world-wide rights in all diagnostic and therapeutic uses of tilmanocept. The license agreement is effective until the third anniversary of the expiration date of the longest-lived underlying patent. Under the terms of the license agreement, UCSD has granted Navidea the exclusive rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import licensed products for all diagnostic and therapeutic uses as defined in the agreement and to practice the defined licensed methods during the term of the agreement. Navidea may also sublicense the patent rights, subject to certain sublicense terms as defined in the agreement. In consideration for the license rights, Navidea agreed to pay UCSD a license issue fee of $25,000 and license maintenance fees of $25,000 per year. We also agreed to make payments to UCSD upon successfully reaching certain clinical, regulatory and cumulative sales milestones, and a royalty on net sales of licensed products subject to a $25,000 minimum annual royalty. Navidea also agreed to reimburse UCSD for all patent-related costs and to meet certain diligence targets.

&#160;

&#160;

In June 2015, results from several pre-clinical Manocept studies in RA were presented at the EULAR 2015 European Congress of Rheumatology. The results of the studies, led by Wael Jarjour, M.D. and Thomas J. Rosol , D.V.M., Ph.D., of The Ohio State University Wexner Med ical Center and College of Veterinary Medicine, respectively , highlighted the potential of CD206-targeting Manocept constructs to detect immune-mediated inflammation in RA which could be used diagnostically, to monitor therapeutic efficacy, or as a potenti al therapeutic platform. The presentation showed results from synovial fluid and tissue acquired from RA patients for comparison to normal frozen archival tissue and synovial tissue procured from patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Tissues were probed wit h Manocept-Cy3, DAPI nuclear stain, and anti CD206-cyanine. Mononuclear cells were isolated from RA synovial fluid and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results demonstrated that archival synovial tissue and synovial fluid obtained from patients diagnosed with RA contain a significant population of macrophages that express high levels of the CD206 receptor. It was shown that these macrophages strongly co-localize Manocept-Cy3 and CD206 receptors. The degree of macrophage infiltration in tissue from healthy or osteoarthritic patients was significantly lower than in RA tissues. Additionally, in an in-vivo animal study, arthritis was induced in mice and was followed with intravenous injection of Manocept-Cy3 and epi-fluorescent imaging. Imaging results indicated that Manocept can be detected in inflamed joints in an in vivo animal model of RA. 

In July 2015, imaging results from the Manocept clinical trial in KS and other preclinical studies were presented at the 18th International Workshop on Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus (KSHV) and Related Agents. The clinical imaging study, using Tc 99m tilmanocept in both HIV+ and HIV- patients suggests that KS tumor lesions, both cutaneous and suspected extra-cutaneous sites, can be easily visualized and mapped, demonstrating that this technique may potentially provide a means for routine patient assessment. The results also demonstrate that use of Manocept represents a potential therapeutic pathway for targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Manocept agents are designed to target CD206, which is highly expressed on TAMs and the KS tumor itself. As a potential therapeutic, Manocept could be used as a precision vehicle to deliver payloads to tumor sites throughout the body. Five Human Herpes Virus8 positive (HHV8+) patients (4 HIV+, 1HIV-) were enrolled in the NAV3-12 study. Patients received a single subcutaneous injection of Tc 99m tilmanocept in the region of a cutaneous KS lesion and imaging was performed at 1, 4 and 24 hours post-injection to visualize localization of tilmanocept. Results represented by whole body SPECT/CT imaging scans from study patients were presented. Collectively, the scans show localization of tilmanocept specifically in KS and detected multiple cutaneous lesions in the extremities, as well as extra-cutaneous localization found in the nasopharynx, lymph nodes and brain. Results also indicate that KS lesions are anatomically linked in chains by and within the lymph ducts. The study concludes that both HIV+ and HIV- patients have pan-tumor expression of CD206, strongly suggests tilmanocept crosses the blood-brain barrier and that a Manocept-drug conjugate may have the potential as a therapeutic with high target effect and low off-target concerns. The data from these studies also suggest a novel theory on the genesis of KS in which KS arises from an HHV8 infected macrophage type cell and its interaction with the lymphatic system. This interaction provides the means for access of the KS through CD206 receptor for diagnosis, evaluation, and potential therapy using the Manocept platform.

In July 2015, we received a notice of award for a Phase 1 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant providing $322,000 from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, NIH. The study, currently ongoing in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, will examine the ability of Tc 99m tilmanocept to localize in high-risk atherosclerotic plaques. These specific plaques are rich in CD206 expressing macrophages and are at high risk for near term rupture resulting in myocardial infarctions, sudden cardiac death and strokes. The consequences of atherosclerosis and the cardiovascular disease that atherosclerosis causes, while severe in all populations of people, are particularly concentrated in HIV+ patients. Recently, it has been observed that CD206 expressing macrophages densely populate vulnerable plaques or thin cap fibroatheromas but not other kinds (i.e., calcified plaques) of atherosclerotic plaques. A primary goal for this grant involves an approved clinical investigation of up to 18 individuals with and without aortic and high risk coronary atherosclerotic plaques and with and without HIV infection to determine the feasibility of Tc 99m tilmanocept to image high risk plaque by SPECT/CT. Contrast with NaF18 is a parallel evaluation. Results have the potential to provide evidence of the potential of Tc 99m tilmanocept to accumulate in high risk morphology plaques, the ability to make preliminary comparisons of aortic Tc 99m tilmanocept uptake by SPECT/CT in each group, and to evaluate the ability of Tc 99m tilmanocept to identify the same aortic atherosclerotic plaques that are identified by contrast enhanced coronary computed tomography angiography and/or PET/CT.

Also in July 2015, we received an initial notice of award for a Fast Track SBIR grant providing for up to $1.7 million from the NIH's National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, to fund preclinical animal studies and a Phase 1/2 human clinical study examining the ability of Tc 99m tilmanocept to identify skeletal joints that are inflamed due to RA. RA is a chronic, progressive, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of numerous skeletal joints. If not treated successfully, RA can lead to disability, disfigurement and premature death. The funds for this Fast Track grant will be released in two parts, which together have the potential to provide a total of $1.7 million in resources over two and a half years to achieve the specific aims and objectives of the grant. The first part will provide $225,000 to support preclinical animal studies and to support activities needed to prepare for the Phase 1/2 clinical study. The second part of the award will support the Phase 1/2 study, the results from which are expected to confirm the safety and effectiveness of Tc 99m tilmanocept to identify skeletal joint inflammation due to RA.

In September 2015, we received an initial notice of award for a Fast Track SBIR grant providing for up to $1.8 million from the NIH&#8217;s National Cancer Institute to fund preclinical studies examining the safety of intravenous (IV) injection of Tc99m tilmanocept, a Manocept platform product, followed by a clinical study providing the initial evaluation of the safety and efficacy of SPECT imaging

studies with IV Tc99m tilmanocept to identify and quantify both skin- and organ-associated KS lesions in human patients. &#160; The grant is awarded in two parts with the potential for total grant money of up to $1.8 mill ion over two and a half years. The first six-month funding segment of $300,000, which has already been awarded, is expected to enable Navidea to secure necessary collaborations and Institutional Review Board approvals. The second funding segment could pr ovide for up to an additional $1.5 million to be used to accrue participants, perform the Phase 1/2 study and perform data analyses to confirm the safety and effectiveness of intravenously administered Tc99m tilmanocept. 

Over the course of the last few years, management has provided periodic updates regarding the status of the NAV1800 development program we previously referred to as the RIGS &#174; (radioimmunguided surgery) program. NAV1800 was originally intended to use a monoclonal antibody as an aid in identifying TAG-72, a specific factor associated with a primary tumor, ascertaining tumor margins, or determining the extent and location of occult and metastatic tumor in patients with solid tumor cancers, such as colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, or endometrial cancer. The detection of clinically occult tumor was originally intended to provide the surgeon with a more accurate assessment of the extent and location of disease, and therefore impact the surgical and therapeutic management of the patient.

Over the last few years, our commercial evaluation of new clinical data has caused us to question the viability of the monoclonal antibody initiative as it was originally envisioned. During the same time period, we learned significantly more about tilmanocept, the underlying Manocept backbone, and the potential utility of tilmanocept in identifying TAMs, and their consequent potential utility in identifying multifocal tumor disease itself. To that end, we petitioned the NIH to repurpose the $1.5 million grant we were previously awarded towards the study of TAMs in colorectal cancer, and subsequently received confirmation of the acceptance of this repurposing. This repurposed grant now supports a Manocept-based diagnostic approach in patients with anal/rectal cancer and possibly colon cancer. We recognize this repurposing represents a major refocusing of the original NAV1800 initiative, but we are confident that this change represents the best course of action at this time towards benefiting patients afflicted with colorectal cancer and is one which is consistent with the excitement we are seeing on many fronts related to our work on the Manocept platform. However, we cannot assure you that if further clinical trials for this product proceed, that they will be successful, that the product will achieve regulatory approval, or if approved, that it will achieve market acceptance. See Risk Factors.

Macrophage Therapeutics Background 

In December 2014, the Company formed a new business unit, Macrophage Therapeutics, to further explore therapeutic applications for the Manocept platform. In January 2015, Navidea incorporated the business unit as Macrophage Therapeutics, Inc. (MT), initially a wholly-owned subsidiary of Navidea.

In December 2014, MT hosted a conference where data were presented using the Manocept platform compound, tilmanocept, that was generated by Navidea and independent academic collaborators with expertise in the HIV/AIDS, cancer, TB, RA and cardiovascular disease therapeutic areas. The technical presentations highlighted tilmanocept&#8217;s ability to target activated macrophages implicated in the natural history of numerous diseases.

In February 2015, Navidea announced the appointment of leading experts to a newly formed scientific advisory board (SAB) to serve as a strategic resource to MT as MT looks to develop therapeutic applications for Navidea&#8217;s Manocept platform. The inaugural SAB consortium is comprised of world-renowned scientists and clinicians in the areas of oncology, immunology, autoimmune diseases and macrophage biology. The SAB will serve as an ongoing resource to provide counsel and guidance pertaining to the research, development, and clinical use of our Manocept technology in therapeutic applications.

In March 2015, MT entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to sell up to 50 shares of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (MT Preferred Stock) and warrants to purchase up to an additional 1,500 common shares of Macrophage Therapeutics, Inc. (MT Common Stock) to Platinum-Montaur Life Sciences LLC, an affiliate of Platinum Management (NY) LLC, Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage Fund L.P., Platinum Partners Liquid Opportunity Master Fund L.P., Platinum Liquid Opportunity Management (NY) LLC, and Montsant Partners LLC (collectively, Platinum) and Dr. Michael Goldberg, one of our directors and CEO of Macrophage Therapeutics, Inc. (collectively, the Investors); the agreed purchase price was $50,000 per unit. On March 13, 2015, Navidea announced that definitive agreements with the Investors had been signed for the sale of the first 10 shares of MT Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 300 shares of MT Common Stock to the Investors, with gross proceeds to MT of $500,000. Under the agreement, 40% of the MT Preferred Stock and warrants are committed to be purchased by Dr. Goldberg, and the balance by Platinum. The full 50 shares of MT Preferred Stock and warrants that may be sold under the agreement are convertible into and exercisable for MT Common Stock representing an aggregate 1% interest on a fully converted and exercised basis. Navidea retains ownership of the remainder of MT Common Stock.

In addition, Navidea entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement with the Investors providing them an option to exchange their MT Preferred Stock for our common stock in the event that MT has not completed a public offering with gross proceeds to MT of at least $50 million by the second anniversary of the closing of the initial sale of MT Preferred Stock, at an exchange rate per share obtained by dividing $50,000 by the greater of (i) 80% of the twenty-day volume weighted average price per share of our common stock on the second anniversary of the initial closing or (ii) $3.00. To the extent that the Investors do not timely exercise their exchange right, MT 

&#160;

&#160;

has the right to redeem their MT Preferred Stock for a price equal to $58,320 per share. Navidea also granted MT an exclusive license for certain therapeutic appli cations of the Manocept technology. 

In June 2015, BIND Therapeutics, Inc. (BIND), an early clinical-stage nanomedicine company developing targeted and programmable therapeutics called Accurins&#8482;, and MT entered into a research collaboration to engineer Accurins with the Manocept targeting platform. This agreement was renewed in February 2016 to extend the agreement through February 2017. Disease-associated macrophages generally play a pro-tumoral role and are immunosuppressive, preventing the immune system from mounting an attack on tumor cells. Based on the expression of CD206 mannose receptors on disease-associated macrophages, BIND and MT plan to consider joint research programs that may be capable of concentrating various therapeutic payloads to the tumor microenvironment.

In September 2015, MT announced that it had developed preliminary processes for producing the first two therapeutic Manocept immunoconstructs, MT-1001, designed to specifically target and kill activated CD206+ macrophages and MT-2001, designed to inhibit the inflammatory activity of activated CD206+ macrophages. These constructs are the result of the activities of Navidea&#8217;s clinical development and research group. MT-1001 and MT-2001 were developed from the Manocept platform technology and the efforts of Navidea&#8217;s development team and contain a similar chemical scaffold and targeting moieties designed to selectively target CD206+ macrophages. A payload of a therapeutic molecule is conjugated to each immunoconstruct through a linkage that will release the molecule within the targeted tissue: MT-1001 has doxorubicin, an anthracycline antitumor antibiotic, conjugated to the Manocept backbone and MT-2001 has a potent anti-inflammatory agent conjugated to it. MT has contracted with an independent facility to produce sufficient quantities of MT-1001 and MT-2001 along with the concomitant analytical standards, to provide material for planned preclinical animal studies.

Macrophage Therapeutics Clinical Data 

In March 2015, Navidea and MT announced that data from an ongoing human study indicated that the Manocept technology platform has the ability to safely cross the blood brain barrier without losing its ability to deliver its payload to the intended target. Based on these data and on the advice of the Company&#8217;s SAB, MT hopes to expand the SAB to include members with specific expertise in CNS diseases. The blood brain barrier has proven to be a significant obstacle to treating many diseases of the central nervous system. In an imaging study using the Manocept targeted delivery system, foci on the other side of the blood brain barrier were observed that strongly and specifically localized tilmanocept. Many of the leading diseases of the central nervous system such as Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s diseases as well as autoimmune CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis and ALS have pathologies that can in part be attributed to over-active macrophages, the target for Manocept delivery technology.

In July 2015, Navidea and MT announced that preclinical results in KS demonstrated that a cytotoxic drug, doxorubicin, linked to Manocept was targeted to and dose-dependently taken up in CD206+ KS tumor cells and TAMs and caused apoptotic death of the KS tumor cells and TAMs. The results were presented at the 18th International Workshop on KSHV and Related Agents by Michael S. McGrath, M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Departments of Laboratory Medicine, Pathology, and Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The study also shows that Cy3-Manocept and a Cy3-Manocept-doxorubicin conjugate quantitatively permitted the evaluation of tumor burden, tissue uptake of Manocept and tumor response to therapy in vitro and ex vivo , supporting the potential for the Manocept platform to be used not only diagnostically but as a precision targeted molecule to deliver payloads to tumor sites throughout the body. In summary, the data presented include evidence that:

&#160;

&#183; 

KS tissue based cells take up Cy3-Manocept or Cy3-Manocept-doxorubicin into both KS tumor cells and TAMs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Manocept conjugate uptake is dose and time dependent in CD206+ macrophages. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Cy3-Manocept and Cy3-Manocept-doxorubicin bind to CD206 positive macrophages equivalently indicating that the linkage of a drug conjugate did not lessen the CD206 binding ability. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Manocept-doxorubicin killed CD206 expressing macrophages. After 24 hours, Cy3-Manocept-doxorubicin killed 70% of CD206 positive macrophages in tissue cultures. Doxorubicin alone showed no toxicity. 

&#160;

&#183; 

KS organ culture treated with Manocept-doxorubicin resulted in the loss of macrophages and induced programmed tumor cell death and apoptosis in KS HHV8+ spindle cells, and showed anti-HIV activity in HIV infected macrophage cultures. 

Navidea and MT continue to evaluate emerging data in other disease states to define areas of focus, development pathways and partnering options to capitalize on the Manocept platform, including ongoing studies in KS and RA. The immune-inflammatory process is remarkably complex and tightly regulated with indicators that initiate, maintain and shut down the process. Macrophages are immune cells that play a critical role in the initiation, maintenance, and resolution of inflammation. They are activated and deactivated in the inflammatory process. Because macrophages may promote dysregulation that accelerates or enhances disease progression, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that target macrophages may open new avenues for controlling inflammatory diseases. We cannot assure you that further evaluation or development will be successful, that any Manocept platform product candidate will ultimately achieve regulatory approval, or if approved, the extent to which it will achieve market acceptance. See Risk Factors.

NAV4694 (Candidate for Out-License) 

NAV4694 is a fluorine-18 (F-18) labeled PET imaging agent being developed as an aid in the imaging and evaluation of patients with signs or symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). NAV4694 binds to beta-amyloid deposits in the brain that can then be imaged in PET scans. Amyloid plaque pathology is a required feature of AD and the presence of amyloid pathology is a supportive feature for diagnosis of probable AD. Patients who are negative for amyloid pathology do not have AD. NAV4694 has been studied in rigorous pre-clinical studies and clinical trials in humans. Clinical studies through Phase 3 have included subjects with MCI, suspected AD patients, and healthy volunteers. Results suggest that NAV4694 has the potential ability to image patients quickly and safely with high sensitivity and specificity.

In May 2014, the Board of Directors made the decision to refocus the Company's resources to better align the funding of our pipeline programs with the expected growth in Lymphoseek revenue. This realignment primarily involved reducing our near-term support for our neurological product candidates, including NAV4694, as we sought a development partner or partners for these programs. The Company is currently engaged in discussions related to the potential partnering or divestiture of NAV4694. We continue to have active interest from potential partners or acquirers; however, our negotiations have experienced delays due in large part to litigation brought by one of the potential partners (see Item 3 &#8211; Legal Proceedings). The Company believes the suit is without merit and has filed a motion to dismiss the action. While it is not possible to determine with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding, including making a determination of liability, we believe that we have meritorious defenses with respect to the claims asserted against us and intend to vigorously defend our position.

NAV5001 (In-License Terminated) 

NAV5001 is an iodine-123 (I-123) labeled SPECT imaging agent being developed as an aid in the diagnosis of Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) and other movement disorders, with potential use as a diagnostic aid in dementia. The agent binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT) on the cell surface of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra regions of the brain. Loss of these neurons is a hallmark of PD. In addition to its potential use as an aid in the differential diagnosis of PD and movement disorders, NAV5001 may also be useful in the diagnosis of Dementia with Lewy Bodies, one of the most common forms of dementia after AD.

In May 2014, the Board of Directors made the decision to refocus the Company's resources to better align the funding of our pipeline programs with the expected growth in Lymphoseek revenue. This realignment primarily involved reducing our near-term support for our neurological product candidates, including NAV5001.

In April 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with Alseres to terminate the sub-license agreement dated July 31, 2012 for research, development and commercialization of NAV5001. Under the terms of this agreement, Navidea transferred all regulatory, clinical and manufacturing-related data related to NAV5001 to Alseres. Alseres agreed to reimburse Navidea for any incurred maintenance costs of the contract manufacturer retroactive to March 1, 2015. In addition, Navidea has supplied clinical support services for NAV5001 on a cost-plus reimbursement basis. However, to this point, Alseres has been unsuccessful in raising the funds necessary to restart the program and reimburse Navidea. As a result, we have taken steps to end our obligations under the agreement and notified Alseres that we consider them in breach of the agreement. We are in the process of trying to recover the funds we expended complying with our obligations under the termination agreement.

Market Overviews

Lymphoseek - Cancer Market Overview

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the U.S. and Western Europe. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that cancer will cause over 596,000 deaths in 2016 in the U.S. alone. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has estimated that the direct medical costs for cancer in the U.S. for 2013 were $74.8 billion. Additionally, the ACS estimates that approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the U.S. during 2016. For the types of cancer to which our oncology agents may be applicable (breast, melanoma, head and neck, prostate, lung, colorectal, gastrointestinal and gynecologic), the ACS has estimated that over 1.1 million new cases will occur in the U.S. in 2016.

Currently, the application of intraoperative lymphatic mapping (ILM) is most established in breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer among all women in the U.S. The probability of developing breast cancer generally increases with age, rising from about 1.9% in women under age 49 to 6.7% in women age 70 or older. According to the ACS, over 247,000 new cases of breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed during 2016 in the U.S. alone. The incidence rate for breast cancer appears to be stable. Thus, we believe that the aging of the population, combined with improved education and awareness of breast cancer and diagnostic methods, will continue to lead to an increased number of breast cancer surgical diagnostic procedures.

&#160;

&#160;

The use of ILM is also common in melanoma. T he ACS estimates that approximately 7 6 ,000 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in the U.S. during 201 6 . In addition to breast cancer and melanoma, we believe that our oncology products may have utility in other cancer types with another 809,000 new cases expected during 201 6 in the U.S. 

If the potential of Lymphoseek as a radioactive tracing agent is ultimately realized, it may address not only the breast and melanoma markets on a procedural basis, but also assist in the clinical evaluation and staging of solid tumor cancers and expanding lymph node mapping to other solid tumor cancers such as prostate, gastric, colon, head and neck, gynecologic, and non-small cell lung. Lymphoseek is approved by the U.S. FDA for use in solid tumor cancers where lymphatic mapping is a component of surgical management and for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with clinically node negative breast cancer, melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Lymphoseek has also received European approval in imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with melanoma, breast cancer or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.

Manocept Diagnostics and Macrophage Therapeutics Market Overview

Impairment of the macrophage-driven disease mechanism is an area of increasing focus in medicine. The number of people affected by all the inflammatory diseases combined is estimated at more than 40 million in the United States and perhaps 700 million worldwide, making these macrophage-mediated diseases an area of remarkable clinical importance. There are many recognized disorders having macrophage involvement, including RA, atherosclerosis/vulnerable plaque, Crohn&#8217;s disease, TB, systemic lupus erythematosis, KS, and others that span clinical areas in oncology, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, cardiology, and inflammation. Data from studies using agents from the Manocept platform in RA, KS and TB were published in a special supplement, Nature Outlook: Medical Imaging , in Nature&#8217;s October 31, 2013 issue. The supplement included a White Paper by Navidea entitled &#8220; Innovations in receptor-targeted precision imaging at Navidea: Diagnosis up close and personal, &#8221; focused on the Manocept platform. While Navidea&#8217;s development of the Manocept platform still in relatively early stage, below is a table summarizing potential target markets in which Manocept may have potential diagnostic or therapeutic applications:

NAV4694 - Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Market Overview

The Alzheimer&#8217;s Association (AA) estimates that more than 5.3 million Americans had AD in 2015. On a global basis, Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease International estimated in 2015 that there were 46.8 million people living with dementia. AA estimates that total costs for AD care was approximately $226 billion in 2015 and is expected to rise to more than $1 trillion by 2050. AA also estimates that there are over 15 million AD and dementia caregivers providing 17.9 billion hours of unpaid care valued at $217.7 billion. AD is the sixth-leading cause of death in the country and the only cause of death among the top 10 in the U.S. that cannot be prevented, cured or even slowed. Based on mortality data from 2000-2013, deaths from AD have risen 71 percent while deaths attributed to the number one cause of death, heart disease, decreased 14 percent during the same period. In February 2013, the American Academy of Neurology reported in the online issue of Neurology that the number of people with AD may triple by 2050.

Marketing and Distribution

We believe the most preferable and likely distribution partners for Lymphoseek would be entities with established radiopharmaceutical distribution channels, although it is possible that other entities with more traditional oncology or neurological pharmaceutical portfolios may also have interest.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we executed an agreement with Cardinal Health Inc.&#8217;s (Cardinal) Nuclear Pharmacy Services division for the exclusive distribution of Lymphoseek in the U.S. The agreement is for a term of five years from the date of FDA marketing clearance, March 13, 2013. Under the terms of this agreement, Navidea receives a significant share of the revenue from each patient dose of Lymphoseek sold. In addition, Navidea will receive up to $3 million in payments upon the achievement of certain sales milestones by Cardinal Health. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain a successful relationship with Cardinal Health, on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.

In May 2013 the Company announced the commercial launch of Lymphoseek in the U.S. through a distribution agreement with Cardinal. In addition to distributing Lymphoseek to hospitals, Cardinal augments product promotion to nuclear medicine professionals. The Navidea commercial team is responsible for designing and driving Lymphoseek promotional activities and conducting medical education programs tailored to the oncology treatment team, including surgeons and nuclear medicine physicians. Although it is early after the most recent FDA label expansion, we believe we are seeing positive signs in measures of success we believe are critical to the success of our new commercial strategy and deployment.

&#160;

&#160;

With respect to Lymphoseek commercialization in Europe, we are aiming to deploy a specialty pharmaceutical strategy to co mmercialization that would be supportive of premium product positioning and reinforce Lymphoseek's clinical value proposition, as opposed to a commodity or a generics positioning approach. Unlike the U.S., where institutions typically rely on radiopharmac eutical products which are compounded and delivered by specialized radiopharmacy distributors such as Cardinal, institutions in Europe predominantly purchase non-radiolabeled material and compound the radioactive product on-site. In March 2015, we entered into an exclusive sublicense agreement for the commercialization and distribution of Lymphoseek 250 microgram kit for radiopharmaceutical preparation (tilmanocept) in the European Union with SpePharm AG (an affiliate of Norgine BV), a European specialist pharmaceutical company with an extensive pan-European presence. Under the terms of the exclusive license agreement, Navidea will supply Lymphoseek product to SpePharm ; however, Navidea will transfer responsibility for regulatory maintenance of the Lymphos eek Marketing Authorization to SpePharm . SpePharm will also be responsible for pricing, reimbursement, sales, marketing, medical affairs, and regulatory activities. In connection with entering into the agreement, Navidea is entitled to an upfront payment of $2 million, milestones totaling up to an additional $5 million, and royalties on European net sales. The initial territory covered by the agreement includes all 28 member states of the European Economic Community with the option to expand into additio nal geographical areas. SpePharm is currently performing the customary pre-launch market access activities to support commercial launch in the EU later in 2016. Concurrently, we are completing manufacturing validation activities on a finished drug produc t contract manufacturing facility to support the Company&#8217;s supply chain, primarily in Europe. 

In August 2014, Navidea entered into an exclusive agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hainan Sinotau Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Sinotau), a pharmaceutical organization with a broad China focus in oncology and other therapeutic areas, who will develop and commercialize Lymphoseek in China. In exchange, Navidea will earn revenue based on unit sales to Sinotau, a royalty based on Sinotau&#8217;s sales of Lymphoseek and up to $2.5 million in milestone payments from Sinotau, including a $300,000 non-refundable upfront payment. As part of the agreement, Sinotau is responsible for costs and conduct of clinical studies and regulatory applications to obtain Lymphoseek approval by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). Upon approval, Sinotau will be responsible for all Lymphoseek sales, marketing, market access and medical affairs activities in China and excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Navidea and Sinotau will jointly support certain pre-market planning activities with a joint commitment on clinical and market development programs pending CFDA approval. In addition to the $300,000 upfront payment, Navidea is eligible for $700,000 in milestone payments up to and through product approval, and an additional $1.5 million in sales milestones.

The Company also has distribution arrangements covering other global markets such as Canada, Taiwan, Puerto Rico, and select medical centers in the Middle East. Lymphoseek is in various stages of approval in these territories and sales to this point in these markets, if any, have not been material. However, we believe that with international partnerships to complement our position in the U.S. and EU, we will help establish Lymphoseek as a global leader in lymphatic mapping, as we are aware of no other company which has this global geographic range. We cannot assure you that Lymphoseek will achieve regulatory approval in any market outside the U.S. or EU, or if approved, that it will achieve market acceptance in any market. We also cannot assure you that we will be successful in securing collaborative partners for other global markets or radiopharmaceutical products, or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms for such arrangements. See Risk Factors.

Manufacturing

We currently use and expect to continue to be dependent upon contract manufacturers to manufacture each of our product candidates. We have established a quality control and quality assurance program, including a set of standard operating procedures and specifications with the goal that our products and product candidates are manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and other applicable domestic and international regulations. We will need to invest in additional manufacturing and supply chain resources, and may seek to enter into additional collaborative arrangements with other parties that have established manufacturing capabilities. It is likely that we will continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for our development and commercial products on a contract basis.

Lymphoseek Manufacturing

Reliable Biopharmaceutical Corporation (Reliable) produces the drug substance and OSO BioPharmaceuticals Manufacturing, LLC (OsoBio) performs final product manufacturing including final drug formulation, lyophilization (freeze-drying) and packaging processes for Lymphoseek to be sold in the U.S. Gipharma S.r.l. (Gipharma) will perform final product manufacturing for reduced-mass vials to be sold in the EU. Once packaged, the vialed drug can then be shipped to a hospital or regional commercial radiopharmacy where it will be made radioactive (radiolabeled) with 99m Tc to become the final form of Lymphoseek to be administered to a patient. All three organizations have assisted Navidea in the preparation of the chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) sections of our submissions to the FDA and the EMA. Reliable, OsoBio and Gipharma are registered manufacturers with the FDA and the EMA.

In November 2009, we completed a Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Reliable for the manufacture of the bulk drug substance with an initial term of 10 years. In September 2013, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with OsoBio for contract 

&#160;

&#160;

pharmaceutical devel opment, manufacturing, packaging and analytical services for Lymphoseek. The current agreement with OsoBio runs through December 2016, and automatically renews for additional two-year periods. Also in September 2013, we completed a Service and Supply Mas ter Agreement with Gipharma for process development, manufacturing and packaging of reduced-mass vials for sale in the EU. The agreement with Gipharma has an initial term of three years and automatically renews for additional one-year periods. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing future agreements for the supply of Lymphoseek on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. 

NAV4694 Manufacturing

Supplies of NAV4694 used in clinical development through Phase 2b were manufactured by AstraZeneca through various arrangements. In May 2012, we executed an agreement with Molecular NeuroImaging, LLC (MNI) to produce and distribute NAV4694 to imaging centers within a specified geographic region. In October 2012, we completed an agreement with Spectron mrc, LLC (Spectron) to produce NAV4694 for use at certain clinical trial sites. In August 2013, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with PETNET Solutions, Inc. (PETNET) for the manufacture and distribution of NAV4694 with an initial term of 3 years. Under the terms of the agreement, PETNET will manufacture NAV4694 clinical trial material at select U.S. radiopharmacies, with the possibility of expanding into additional PETNET locations in the future. Navidea has continued to incur costs related to maintaining our NAV4694 manufacturing sites while seeking to partner or out-license the product, and we expect to continue to incur such costs while we complete our partnering/divestiture activities.

Summary

We cannot assure you that we will be successful in securing and/or maintaining the necessary manufacturing, supply and/or radiolabeling capabilities for our product candidates in clinical development. If and when established, we also cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain agreements or other purchasing arrangements with our subcontractors on terms acceptable to us, or that our subcontractors will be able to meet our production requirements on a timely basis, at the required levels of performance and quality, including compliance with FDA cGMP requirements. In the event that any of our subcontractors are unable or unwilling to meet our production requirements, we cannot assure you that an alternate source of supply could be established without significant interruption in product supply or without significant adverse impact to product availability or cost. Any significant supply interruption or yield problems that we or our subcontractors experience would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture our products and, therefore, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations until a new source of supply is qualified. See Risk Factors.

Competition

Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We face competition from a variety of companies focused on developing oncology and neurology diagnostic drugs. We compete with large pharmaceutical and other specialized biotechnology companies. We also face competition from universities and other non-profit research organizations. Many emerging medical product companies have corporate partnership arrangements with large, established companies to support the research, development, and commercialization of products that may be competitive with our products. In addition, a number of large established companies are developing proprietary technologies or have enhanced their capabilities by entering into arrangements with or acquiring companies with technologies applicable to the detection or treatment of cancer and other diseases targeted by our product candidates. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of these competitors have products that have been approved or are in development and operate large, well-funded research and development programs. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, regulatory, marketing, and production resources than we have. Other companies may develop and introduce products and processes competitive with or superior to ours.

We expect to encounter significant competition for our pharmaceutical products. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage if their products work through a similar mechanism as our products and if the approved indications are similar. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases being targeted by us. In some instances, such products have already entered late-stage clinical trials or received FDA approval and may be marketed for some period prior to the approval of our products.

We believe that our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced &#8220;best-in-class&#8221; technology, develop proprietary products, attract and retain scientific personnel, obtain patent or other protection for our products, obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products, either alone or through third parties. We expect that competition among products cleared for marketing will be based on, among other things, product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, and patent position. See Risk Factors.

&#160;

&#160;

Lymphoseek Competition 

Surgeons who practice the lymphatic mapping procedure for which Lymphoseek is intended currently use other radiopharmaceuticals such as a sulfur colloid compound in the U.S., and other colloidal compounds in other markets. In addition, some surgeons still use vital blue dyes to assist in the visual identification of the draining lymphatic tissue around a primary tumor. In the U.S., sulfur colloid is manufactured by Pharmalucence, a subsidiary of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Sulfur colloid had been used &#8220;off-label&#8221; in the U.S. for ILM until July 2011, when it was approved by the FDA for use in lymphatic mapping in breast cancer patients based on a statistical meta-analysis of published literature that compared the use of sulfur colloid with that of the vital blue dyes. The product label for sulfur colloid was expanded to cover lymphatic mapping in melanoma in August 2012, again on the basis of a meta-analysis of published literature. In the EU and certain Pacific Rim markets, there are other colloidal-based compounds with various levels of approved labeling for use in lymphatic mapping, although a number of countries still employ the use of products used &#8220;off-label.&#8221;

NAV4694 Competition

Several potential competitive [ 18 F] products have been approved for use as biomarkers to aid in detection of AD. Developed through Eli Lilly&#8217;s wholly-owned Avid Radiopharmaceuticals (Avid), florbetapir, now known as Amyvid, received FDA approval to market in April 2012. Florbetapir also received marketing authorization in the EU in January 2013. In addition to fluorbetapir, there are two other beta-amyloid imaging agents available: florbetaben from Piramal Enterprises, Imaging Division, and flutemetamol from GE Healthcare. In October 2013, the FDA approved flutemetamol, under the name VizamylTM, for adults being evaluated for AD and dementia with PET brain imaging. Florbetaben, now called NeuraceqTM, received EMA approval for use in PET imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment who are being evaluated for AD and other causes of cognitive decline from the EMA in February 2014 and from the FDA in March 2014.

Patents and Proprietary Rights

The patent position of biotechnology, including our company, generally is highly uncertain and may involve complex legal and factual questions. Potential competitors may have filed applications, or may have been issued patents, or may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights relating to products or processes in the same area of technology as that used by the Company. The scope and validity of these patents and applications, the extent to which we may be required to obtain licenses thereunder or under other proprietary rights, and the cost and availability of licenses are uncertain. We cannot assure you that our patent applications or those licensed to us will result in additional patents being issued or that any of our patents or those licensed to us will afford protection against competitors with similar technology; nor can we assure you that any of these patents will not be designed around by others or that others will not obtain patents that we would need to license or design around.

We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets. We cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets.

We require our employees, consultants, advisers, and suppliers to execute a confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of an employment, consulting or manufacturing relationship with us. The agreement provides that all confidential information developed by or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship will be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual will be the exclusive property of our company. We cannot assure you, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. We also employ a variety of security measures to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and to limit access by unauthorized persons. We cannot assure you, however, that these measures will be adequate to protect our trade secrets from unauthorized access or disclosure. See Risk Factors.

Manocept/Lymphoseek Intellectual Property

Lymphoseek, as well as certain aspects of intellectual property underlying the Manocept platform, is under exclusive worldwide license from the Regents of the University of California. The license grants Navidea the commercialization rights to Lymphoseek for diagnostic imaging and intraoperative detection applications.

Lymphoseek, including the Manocept backbone composition and methods of use, is the subject of multiple patent families totaling 26 patents and patent applications in the United States and certain major foreign markets. The patents and patent applications held by the Regents of the University of California have been licensed exclusively to Navidea for all diagnostic and therapeutic uses worldwide.

The first composition of matter patent covering Manocept was issued in the United States in June 2002. This patent will expire in May 2020, but a request for patent term extension has been filed to further extend the life of this patent. The claims of the composition of matter patent covering Manocept have been allowed in the EU and issued in the majority of major-market EU 

&#160;

&#160;

countries in 2005. These patents will expire in 2020, but a request for supplemental protection certificates are in process to furthe r extend the life of these patents. The composition of matter patent has also been issued in Japan. This patent will expire in 2020. 

We have filed additional patent applications in the U.S. and certain major foreign markets related to manufacturing processes for Lymphoseek and Manocept, the first of which was issued in the U.S. in 2013. These patents and/or applications will expire between 2029 and 2032. We have filed further patent applications jointly with The Ohio State Innovation Foundation related to CD206 expressing cell-related disorders. These patents and/or applications will expire between 2034 and 2035. We have filed further patent applications related to 2-heteroaryl substituted benzofurans. These patents and/or applications will expire between 2036 and 2037.

We will also rely on trademark protection for products that we expect to commercialize and have registered or are in the process of registering the marks Lymphoseek &#174; , Manocept&#8482;, and the Lymphoseek logo&#8482; in the U.S. and other markets.

NAV4694 Intellectual Property

NAV4694 is being developed under an exclusive worldwide license from AstraZeneca. The NAV4694 license grants Navidea commercialization rights to the fluorine-18 labeled biomarker for use as an aid in the diagnosis of AD. NAV4694 is the subject of 3 issued patents in the U.S. and 29 patents issued or pending in 13 foreign jurisdictions covering the [ 18 F]NAV4694 drug substance and the NAV4694 precursor. These patents and/or applications will expire between 2028 and 2029.

Government Regulation

The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Public Health Service Act, and their implementing regulations. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications or supplemental applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. We also may be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Atomic Energy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Export Control Act and other present and future laws of general application as well as those specifically related to radiopharmaceuticals.

Most aspects of our business are subject to some degree of government regulation in the countries in which we conduct our operations. As a developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical products, we are subject to extensive regulation by, among other governmental entities, the FDA and the corresponding state, local and foreign regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which our products are intended to be sold. These regulations govern the introduction of new products, the observance of certain standards with respect to the manufacture, quality, safety, efficacy and labeling of such products, the maintenance of certain records, the tracking of such products, performance surveillance and other matters.

Failure to comply with applicable federal, state, local or foreign laws or regulations could subject us to enforcement action, including product seizures, recalls, withdrawal of marketing clearances, and civil and criminal penalties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such governmental regulations. However, federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of radiopharmaceuticals are subject to future changes. We cannot assure you that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on our company.

For some products, and in some countries, government regulation is significant and, in general, there is a trend toward more stringent regulation. In recent years, the FDA and certain foreign regulatory bodies have pursued a more rigorous enforcement program to ensure that regulated businesses like ours comply with applicable laws and regulations. We devote significant time, effort and expense addressing the extensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to our business. To date, we have not received a noncompliance notification or warning letter from the FDA or any other regulatory bodies of alleged deficiencies in our compliance with the relevant requirements, nor have we recalled or issued safety alerts on any of our products. However, we cannot assure you that a warning letter, recall or safety alert, if it occurred, would not have a material adverse effect on our company. See Risk Factors.

In the early- to mid-1990s, the review time by the FDA to clear medical products for commercial release lengthened and the number of marketing clearances decreased. In response to public and congressional concern, the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 (the 1997 Act) was adopted with the intent of bringing better definition to the clearance process for new medical products. While the FDA review times have improved since passage of the 1997 Act, we cannot assure you that the FDA review processes will not delay our Company's introduction of new products in the U.S. in the future. In addition, many foreign countries have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements that also have added to the delays and uncertainties associated with the development and release of new products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting such releases. It is possible that delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, any necessary clearance for our new product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Risk Factors.

The U.S. Drug Approval Process 

None of our drugs may be marketed in the U.S. until such drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. include:

&#160;

&#183; 

preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA); 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of the manufacturing and clinical facilities at which the drug is produced, tested, and/or distributed to assess compliance with cGMPs and current good clinical practices (cGCP) standards; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless, before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. The study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board at each institution where the trials will be conducted. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational product into people to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited subject population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and further test its safety by using the product candidate in its final form in an expanded subject population. There can be no assurance that Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

The FDA and the IND sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical studies intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA application. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA). These agreements may not be changed after the clinical studies begin, except in limited circumstances. The existence of a SPA, however, does not assure approval of a product candidate.

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacturing quality and composition of the investigational product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial review user fee to the FDA. Before approving a NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities where the product is manufactured, tested and distributed and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product&#8217;s safety or efficacy, or impose other post-approval commitment conditions.

The NDA for Lymphoseek was submitted with the intention for use in intraoperative lymphatic mapping across a broad range of cancers. As a part of their review, the FDA examined the pre-clinical, clinical and CMC data supporting our application, and, as is also typical of such reviews, conducted site audits of our facilities and those of the sites where the referenced clinical trials were performed, as well as of contract suppliers and third party vendors being used in the manufacturing and quality assessment processes 

&#160;

&#160;

for Lymphoseek. Lymphoseek was approved and indicated for use in lymphatic mapping for breast cancer and melanoma by the FDA in March 2013. In June 2014, the FDA approved a sNDA for the expanded use of Lymphoseek indicated for guiding sentinel lymph node biopsy in head and neck cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. In October 2014, the FDA approved a second sNDA for lympha tic mapping in solid tumors and added sentinel lymph node detection for breast cancer and melanoma to the approved indications. The FDA also allowed expanded utilization of Lymphoseek with or without scintigraphic imaging, known as lymphoscintigraphy, to enable pre-operative imaging and mapping of lymph nodes to facilitate node localization during surgical procedures. Additional trials, including an ongoing trial in colorectal cancer, and others in various stages of execution, planning or consideration, a re anticipated to provide additional data to potentially support expansion of the Lymphoseek opportunity. We cannot assure you that Lymphoseek will achieve regulatory approval in any market outside the U.S. or EU, or if approved, that it will achieve mark et acceptance in any market. See Risk Factors. 

The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process of reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those for serious or life threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. We cannot assure you that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these programs, or that, if a drug candidate does qualify, the review time will be reduced or the product will be approved.

After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted.

U.S. Post-Approval Requirements 

Holders of an approved NDA are required to: (i) conduct pharmacovigilance and report certain adverse reactions to the FDA, (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor&#8217;s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing and distribution facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality control and distribution to maintain cGMP compliance. We use and will continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market.

Marketing of prescription drugs is also subject to significant regulation through federal and state agencies tasked with consumer protection and prevention of medical fraud, waste and abuse. We must comply with restrictions on off-label use promotion, anti-kickback, ongoing clinical trial registration, and limitations on gifts and payments to physicians.

Non-U.S. Regulation

Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the U.S., although the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including additional clinical trials that may be required, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.

In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level. The centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states. As of January 1995, a mutual recognition procedure is available at the request of the applicant for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure.

We submitted our MAA for Lymphoseek to the EMA in December 2012. In September 2014, the CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization for Lymphoseek for use in the EU in imaging and intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes draining a primary tumor in adult patients with breast cancer, melanoma, or localized squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. The CHMP's positive opinion was reviewed by the EC, which has the authority to approve medicinal products for use in the 28 countries of the EU and generally follows the recommendations of the CHMP. The EC granted marketing authorization for Lymphoseek in the EU in November 2014.

&#160;

&#160;

While we are unable to predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future regulatory developments, we believe that our substantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions on our operations throughout the world, and our development of new and improved products, should enable us to compete effectively within this environ ment. 

Regulation Specific to Radiopharmaceuticals

Our radiolabeled targeting agents and biologic products, if developed, would require a regulatory license to market from the FDA and from comparable agencies in foreign countries. The process of obtaining regulatory licenses and approvals is costly and time consuming, and we have encountered significant impediments and delays related to our previously proposed biologic products.

The process of completing pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing validation and submission of a marketing application to the appropriate regulatory bodies usually takes a number of years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources, and we cannot assure you that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, the length of time it takes for the various regulatory bodies to evaluate an application for marketing approval varies considerably, as does the amount of preclinical and clinical data required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a specific product. The regulatory bodies may require additional clinical studies that may take several years to perform. The length of the review period may vary widely depending upon the nature and indications of the proposed product and whether the regulatory body has any further questions or requests any additional data. Also, the regulatory bodies require post-marketing reporting and surveillance programs (pharmacovigilance) to monitor the side effects of the products. We cannot assure you that any of our potential drug or biologic products will be approved by the regulatory bodies or approved on a timely or accelerated basis, or that any approvals received will not subsequently be revoked or modified.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) oversees medical uses of nuclear material through licensing, inspection, and enforcement programs. The NRC issues medical use licenses to medical facilities and authorized physician users, develops guidance and regulations for use by licensees, and maintains a committee of medical experts to obtain advice about the use of byproduct materials in medicine. The NRC (or the responsible Agreement State) also regulates the manufacture and distribution of these products. The FDA oversees the good practices in the manufacturing of radiopharmaceuticals, medical devices, and radiation-producing x-ray machines and accelerators. The states regulate the practices of medicine and pharmacy and administer programs associated with radiation-producing x-ray machines and accelerators. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all necessary licenses and permits and be able to comply with all applicable laws. The failure to obtain such licenses and permits or to comply with applicable laws would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
