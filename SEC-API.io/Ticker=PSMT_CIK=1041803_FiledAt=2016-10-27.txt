&#65279; 

Our Company 

&#65279; 

PriceSmart owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouse clubs in Latin America and the Caribbean that offer high quality brand name and private label consumer goods at low prices to individuals and businesses. Our typical no-frills warehouse club-type buildings range in size from 48,000 to 100,000 square feet and are located primarily in and around the major cities in our markets to take advantage of dense populations and relatively higher levels of disposable income. During fiscal year 2016 , average net sales per warehouse club were approximately $7 4.2 million . By offering our members high quality merchandise at competitive prices, we seek to reinforce the value of a PriceSmart membership. We also seek to provide above market and fair wages and benefits to all of our employees as well as a fair return to our stockholders. 

&#65279; 

Our warehouse clubs operate in developing markets that historically have had higher growth rates and lower warehouse club market penetration than the U.S. market. In the countries in which we operate , we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers, specialty stores and traditional wholesale distribution. 

&#65279; 

The numbers of warehouse clubs in operation as of August 31, 2016 for each country or territory were as follows:

In fiscal year 2014, we purchased land in Pereira and Medellin, Colombia and leased land in the city of Bogota, Colombia. We built new warehouse clubs on these three sites. During fiscal year 2015 we opened the Bogota location in October 2014 and the Pereira and Medellin locations in November 2014. Together with the three warehouse clubs that were already operating in Colombia (one in Barranquilla and two in Cali), these three new clubs brought the number of operating PriceSmart warehouse clubs in Colombia to six at the end of fiscal year 2015. We constructed a new warehouse club on land acquired in May 2015 in Chia, Colombia that opened in September 2016, fiscal year 2017, bringing the total of warehouse clubs operating in Colombia to seven. In September 2014, we acquired land in La Chorrera ("Costa Verde"), west of Panama City, Panama, on which we opened our fifth PriceSmart warehouse club in Panama in June 2015. In April 2015, we acquired land in Managua, Nicaragua. We constructed and then opened a warehouse club on this site in November 2015. On December 4, 2015 

&#160;

&#160; 

we signed an option to acquire two properties and then swap them for 59,353 square feet of land adjacent to our San Pedro Sula warehouse club in Honduras. We exercised this option and completed the swap during May 2016. We will use the acquired land to expand the parking lot for the San Pedro Sula warehouse club. The expansion is scheduled to be completed by the end of calendar year 2016.

Competitive Strengths 

Low Operating Costs . Our format is designed to move merchandise from our suppliers to our members at a lower expense ratio than our competitors. We focus on achieving efficiencies in product distribution, minimizing the labor required to stock and display merchandise, limiting non-payroll operating expenses and maintaining low occupancy costs. For example, we offer a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) (approximately 2,400 per warehouse club) with large pack sizes, which allows us to keep shelves stocked with less labor cost than competitors that offer a greater number of SKUs. We also have opened distribution centers in certain of our high volume markets to improve in-stock rates on high volume products. Our focus on driving down operating costs relative to net warehouse club sales allows us to offer lower prices to our members, which we believe helps generate member loyalty and increased sales. 

Membership. Membership has been a basic operating characteristic in the warehouse club industry beginning 40 years ago at Price Club, the first warehouse club. Membership fees enable us to operate our business on lower margins than conventional retail and wholesalers and represent approximately 1.4% of net warehouse club sales. In addition, membership serves to promote customer loyalty. 

Business Members. Our product selection, marketing and general business focus are directed to both business and retail consumers. Our business members include a broad cross section of businesses such as restaurants, institutions including schools, and other businesses that purchase products for resale or use in their businesses. These business members represent a significant source of sales and profit and provide purchasing volume that gives us better prices from our suppliers. 

Innovation. The warehouse club industry recently reached a milestone celebrating forty years since the founding of Price Club in 1976. The world of merchandising has changed greatly in those 40 years , particularly related to technology, the worldwide sourcing of products, a growing middle class in developing countries and ever changing consumer preferences. We have d eveloped know-how to operate effectively in multiple markets, many of which are relatively small, each with different legal requirements, local buying opportunities, cultural norms, unique distribution and logistical challenges and member preferences that require a studied mix of local v ersus imported merchandise. We believe that fundamental to our future success is our capacity to continue to adapt and innovate to meet the needs of our current and future members. 

Experienced Management Team. Our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and many of our senior executives and managers have worked in the warehouse club business most, if not all, of their careers. Their experience and knowledge represent a key strength and competitive advantage for our company. 

Growth Strategy 

Our Board of Directors has approved a growth strategy that includes the following elements: 

Increasing Sales in Current PriceSmart Locations. Our approach for increasing sales at current PriceSmart locations focuses primarily on expanding or reconfiguring our buildings to add selling space and additional parking in our higher volume locations; identifying and purchasing the right products at the lowest possible prices to provide value to our members; and expanding the number of private label products we sell under our Member&#8217;s Selection brand. 

Adding New Warehouse Clubs in Existing Markets. We operate in 13 countries. All of our country markets are small in terms of population and gross domestic product ( &#8220; GDP &#8221; ) except Colombia. In our non-Colombia markets, we plan to add additional warehouse clubs where we believe the markets can support additional clubs. We also plan to continue to add warehouse clubs in Colombia, which is a large market that we believe can potentially provide significant expansion opportunities. 

Efficient Distribution Center Network. &#160; Our distribution center network is an extremely important component of our business success. Our primary distribution center is in Medley, Florida, a suburb of Miami. We recently entered into an agreement to purchase a new 322,000 square foot distribution center in Medley that is designed to improve product handling efficiencies and to replace our current Medley dry products warehouse that we rent. Our distribution centers, both in the Miami area and in many of our countries, enable us to purchase products at low prices, maintain high in-stock levels, increase inventory turn s and support efficient product handling. Not only are our distribution centers currently contributing to efficiencies in buying and product handling, but we believe that our in-country distribution centers will continue to expand their range of operations to increase PriceSmart sales and to lower operating expenses. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; New Products and Services. PriceSmart markets have a combined population of approximately 100 million people and a combined GDP of $800 billion. We currently have a total of 1.5 mil lion membership accounts and 2. 9 individual membership card holders. We believe that there is significant opportunity to increase sales and profits with our current and future members through increasing online shopping opportunities; providing home and business product delivery; and offering additional products and services not currently available to our members. 

New Markets. &#160; We are focused on efforts to expand in Colombia, a market where our membership concept has proven to be well-received and holds significant potential to grow our business, while we continually evaluate potential opportunities for future expansion into new markets in South America. 

Our Membership Policy 

We offer three types of memberships: Business, Diamond, and in Costa Rica Platinum memberships. Businesses qualify for Business membership. We promote Business membership through our marketing programs and by offering certain merchandise targeted primarily to businesses such as restaurants, hotels, convenience stores, offices and institutions. Business members pay an annual membership fee of approximately the equivalent of $30 for a primary and secondary membership card and approximately $10 for additional add-on membership cards. 

The Diamond membership is targeted at individuals and families. The annual fee for a Diamond membership in most markets is approximately $35 (entitling members to two cards). We increased the fee in June 2012 from approximately $30. 

The Company began offering Platinum memberships in Costa Rica during fiscal year 2013, which provides members with a &#160; 2% &#160; rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of &#160; $500.00. Platinum members can apply this rebate to future purchases at the warehouse club at the end of the annual membership period. The Company records this 2% rebate as a reduction of revenue at the time of the sales transaction. Accordingly, the Company has reduced warehouse sales and has accrued a liability within other accrued expenses. The rebate is issued annually to Platinum members on March 1 and expires August 31. Any rebate amount not redeemed by August 31 is recognized as breakage revenue. The Company periodically reviews expired unused rebates outstanding, and the expired unused rebates are recognized as Revenues: Other income on the consolidated statements of income. &#160; &#160; The Company has determined that breakage revenue is insignificant; therefore, it records &#160; 100% &#160; of the Platinum membership liability at the time of sale, rather than estimating breakage. We are considering expanding Platinum membership to other PriceSmart markets and may do so during fiscal year 2017. 

We recognize membership income over the 12-month term of the membership. Deferred membership income is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheet and totaled $20.9 million and $20.2 million as of August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 , respectively. Our membership agreements provide that our members may cancel their membership and may receive a refund of the prorated share of their remaining membership fee if they so request. 

Our &#160; Intellectual Property Rights 

It is our policy to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for trademarks by filing applications for registration of eligible trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers and other similar measures. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While management believes that our trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary know-how have significant value, changing technology and the competitive marketplace make our future success dependent principally upon our employees&#8217; technical competence and creative skills for continuing innovation. 

Our Competition 

Our international merchandising business competes with a wide range of international, regional, national and local retailers, and traditional wholesale distributors. Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, warehouse location and member service. Some of our competitors may have greater resources, buying power and name recognition. In the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in Central America and Grupo &#201;xito and Cencosud in Colombia. We have competed effectively in these markets in the past and expect to continue to do so in the future due to the unique nature of the membership warehouse club format. We have noted that certain retailers are making investments in upgrading their locations within our markets. These actions may result in increased competition within our markets. Further, it is possible that additional U.S. warehouse club operators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with us in a similar warehouse club format. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Employees 

As of August 31, 2016, we had a total of 7,835 employees. Approximately 95% of our employees were employed outside of the United States, and approximately 1,276 employees are represente d by unions. Our policy is to provide employees with good wages relative to the competition in the markets in w hich they work and to provide good benefits which often exceed the legal requirements for countries in which we do business. &#160; We believe that investing in our employees, treating them as partners in our business and providing opportunities for career advancement lead to long-serving, loyal employees, which in turn creates efficiencies in operations and results in better service to our members . We consider our employee relations to be very good. 

Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations 

&#65279; 

Historically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in our markets. In addition fluctuations in our comparable store n et sales, operating income and net income occur as a result of a variety of factors in our markets. &#160; These factors, include but are not limited to: 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

shifts in the timing of certain holidays, especially Easter; 

&#183; 

the timing of new store openings; 

&#183; 

the net sales contributed by new stores; 

&#183; 

changes in our merchandise mix; 

&#183; 

changes in the currency exchange rates that affect the cost of U.S.-sourced products, which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable; 

&#183; 

weather; and 

&#183; 

competition . 

&#65279; 

Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.
