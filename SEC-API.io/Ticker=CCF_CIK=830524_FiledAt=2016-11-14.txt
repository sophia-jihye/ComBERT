Primary Operating Divisions and Facilities and Industry Segments 

&#160; 

Chase Corporation (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;Chase,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;), founded in 1946, is a leading manufacturer of protective materials for high-reliability applications. Our strategy is to maximize the performance of our core businesses and brands while seeking future opportunities through strategic acquisitions. We are organized into two operating segments, an Industrial Materials segment and a Construction Materials segment. The segments are distinguished by the nature of the products we manufacture and how they are delivered to their respective markets. The Industrial Materials segment includes specified products that are used in, or integrated into, another company&#8217;s product, with demand typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Construction Materials segment is principally composed of project-oriented product offerings that are primarily sold and used as "Chase" branded products. Our manufacturing facilities are distinct to their respective segments with the exception of our O&#8217;Hara Township, PA and Blawnox, PA facilities, which produce products related to both operating segments. A summary of our operating structure as of August 31, 2016 is as follows:

As part of this transaction, Chase is acquiring all working capital and fixed assets of the business, and entering into multi-year leases at both locations. The purchase was funded entirely with available cash on hand. Resin Designs is a formulator of customized adhesive and sealant systems used in high-reliability electronic applications. The Company anticipates the acquisition will broaden its adhesives and sealants product offering and manufacturing capabilities, and expand its market reach. The Company is currently in the process of finalizing purchase accounting, and anticipates completion within the first half of fiscal 2017.

&#160; 

Products and Markets 

&#160; 

Our principal products are specialty tapes, laminates, sealants, coatings and chemical intermediates that are sold by our salespeople, manufacturers' representatives and distributors. In our Industrial Materials segment, these products consist of: 

&#160; 

(i) 

insulating and conducting materials for the manufacture of electrical and telephone wire and cable, electrical splicing, and terminating and repair tapes, which are marketed to wire and cable manufacturers; 

&#160; 

(ii) 

laminated film foils, including EMI/RFI shielding tapes used in communication cables; 

&#160; 

(iii) 

moisture protective coatings, which are sold to the electronics industry for circuitry manufacturing including circuitry used in automobiles and home appliances; 

&#160; 

(iv) 

laminated durable papers, including laminated paper with an inner security barrier used in personal and mail-stream privacy protection, which are sold primarily to the envelope converting and commercial printing industries; 

&#160; 

(v) 

pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cables, water and natural gas lines, and power, data, and video cables for commercial buildings; 

&#160; 

(vi) 

cover tapes with reliable adhesive and anti-static properties essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape and reel packaging; 

&#160; 

(vii) 

flexible, rigid and semi-rigid fiber optic strength elements designed to allow fiber optic cables to withstand mechanical and environmental strain and stress; 

&#160; 

(viii) 

polymeric microspheres utilized by various industries to allow for weight and density reduction and sound dampening; 

&#160; 

(ix) 

water-based polyurethane dispersions utilized for various coating products; and 

&#160; 

(x) 

composite strength elements. 

&#160; 

In our Construction Materials segment, these products consist of: 

&#160; 

(i) 

protective pipe coating tapes and other protectants for valves, regulators, casings, joints, metals, concrete and wood, which are sold to oil companies, gas utilities, and pipeline companies for utilization in both the construction and maintenance of oil and gas, water and wastewater pipelines; 

&#160; 

(ii) 

protectants for highway bridge deck metal-supported surfaces, which are sold to municipal transportation authorities; 

&#160; 

(iii)

&#160; 

(iv) 

expansion and control joint systems designed for roads, bridges, stadiums and airport runways. 

&#160;

&#160; 

There is some seasonality in selling products into the construction market. Higher demand is often experienced when temperatures are warmer in most of North America (April through October), with lower demand occurring when temperatures are colder (typically our second fiscal quarter). We did not introduce any new products requiring an investment of a material amount of our assets during fiscal year 2016. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of October 31, 2016, we employed approximately 677 people (including union employees). We consider our employee relations to be good. In the US, we offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. In our operations outside the US, we offer benefits that may vary from those offered to our US employees due to customary local practices and statutory requirements. 

&#160; 

Backlog, Customers and Competition 

&#160; 

As of October 31, 2016, the backlog of customer orders believed to be firm was approximately $17,583,000. This compared with a backlog of $12,717,000 as of October 31, 2015. The increase in backlog from the prior year amount is primarily due to current period increases in wire and cable, pipeline coatings and pulling and detection products, in addition to the inclusion of the Resin Designs LLC backlog. During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination of profits or contracts at the election of the United States Federal Government. 

&#160; 

There are other companies that manufacture or sell products and services similar to those made and sold by us. Many of those companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We compete principally on the basis of technical performance, service reliability, quality and price. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We obtain raw materials from a wide variety of suppliers, with alternative sources of most essential materials available within reasonable lead times. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions &#160; 

&#160;

We do not have any other material trademarks, licenses, franchises, or concessions. While we do hold various patents, as well as other trademarks, we do not believe that they are material to the success of our business. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Working Capital 

&#160; 

We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facility is available for additional working capital needs or investment opportunities. We have historically funded acquisitions through both available cash on hand and through additional borrowings and financing agreements with our bank lenders. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Approximately $2,792,000, $2,690,000 and $2,599,000 was expensed for Company-sponsored research and development during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development increased by $102,000 in fiscal 2016 due to continued focused development work on certain product lines, and twelve full months of research and development related to our specialty chemical intermediates product line, acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.
