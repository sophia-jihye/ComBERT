Company Overview 

&#160; 

We provide one of the most popular content distribution platforms, worldwide, centered on self-expression, attracting both creators looking to promote their content and consumers who utilize such content to express their identity, feelings, tastes and interests. Users primarily access our content via our smartphone app, called Zedge, which offers an easy and modular way to customize smart phones. Depending on the phone&#8217;s mobile operating system, our Zedge app users are able to select personalization content from all or some of the following categories: ringtones, alarms, notification sounds, wallpapers, home screen widgets and app icons. In each category, we offer a wide array of high-quality, free content and content recommendations.

&#160; 

Our smartphone app, available in the Google Play and iTunes app stores, has been installed over 216 million times, has more than 31 million monthly active users, or MAUs, and has averaged among the top 25 free applications in the Google Play store in the U.S. for the past six years and is ranked in the top 15 most popular free apps in the iTunes Entertainment category. MAU is a performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that opened our app in the previous 30-day period. Zedge has grown its user base without material investment in marketing, user acquisition or advertising.

&#160; 

According to a 2014 study conducted by Business Intelligence , mobile users want highly personalized smartphone experiences. Furthermore, in January 2016, Flurry Analytics revealed that personalization apps saw their sessions increase more than 332% in 2015. Although much of this growth was attributable to Emoji keyboards, the appeal for personalization is evident from their research. We believe that our Zedge app&#8217;s popularity stems from its ability to fulfill the demand for smartphone personalization by offering a large and diverse content catalogue, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience and rendering the content in a customized and personally relevant manner. To this end, we invest heavily in both product design and development and the underlying technology required to satisfy our user&#8217;s expectations. As a result of Zedge&#8217;s large, active user base, we offer advertisers, marketers, consumer brands and content providers, including, musicians, artists and brands a powerful way to engage with their prospects and customers. 

&#160; 

Our Zedge app does all of this without handing over core elements of the native operating system to a third party or overwhelming the user with a myriad of complex options. Once installed, the app does not require the user to utilize or install additional apps. As a result, the app provides an intuitive experience that allows the user to maintain the control that we believe they desire. 

&#160; 

As of July 31, 2016, Zedge had in excess of 31 million MAUs. Close to 40% of our Zedge app&#8217;s user base is located in North America with around 30% in Europe. Approximately 65% of our Zedge app&#8217;s users are male.

&#160;

We generate over 90% of our revenues from selling advertising inventory to advertising networks/exchanges, real time bidding platforms, and game publishers. Advertisers are attracted to Zedge because of our sizable and growing user base; user demographics; non-incentivized acquisition platform specifically for mobile game publishers; and our focus on mobile phone personalization. The remainder of our revenue is primarily generated from managing and optimizing advertising inventory for a third-party app publisher, as well as revenue billing, collection and reporting with respect to the advertising.

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, we generated revenues of $11.1 million and income from operations of $1.2 million, compared to revenues of $9.1 million and income from operations of $1.6 million in fiscal year 2015. Of the $11.1 million and $9.1 million in revenues, 94% in each fiscal year was related to or generated from advertising.

&#160;

During fiscal 2016, MoPub represented 45% of our revenue, Google represented 20% of our revenue and Facebook represented 13% of our revenue. During fiscal 2015, MoPub represented 37% of our revenue and Google represented 25% of our revenue.

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

In September 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank for a revolving credit facility of up to $2.5 million. Advances under this facility may not exceed the lesser of $2.5 million or 80% of our eligible accounts receivable subject to certain concentration limits. The revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets. The principal outstanding bears interest per annum at the greater of 3.5% or the prime rate plus 1.25%. Interest is payable monthly and the facility matures in September 2018. We are required to pay an annual facility fee of $12,500 to Western Alliance Bank. We are also required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants as well as maintain certain financial ratios during the term of the revolving credit facility, including we may not pay any dividend on our capital stock. We may terminate this agreement at any time without penalty or premium provided that we pay down any outstanding principal, accrued interest and bank expenses.

We benefit from having a large customer base of more than 31 million MAUs. As of July 31, 2016, approximately 40% of our users were in North America and 30% in Europe, regions that we believe provide for preferred monetization opportunities because we believe that these demographics are more attractive to advertisers. We are one of around 100 Android apps, globally, that has surpassed 100 million installs. To serve our global user base, our Android app is available in 11 languages. Our global footprint helps us to secure a highly diverse portfolio of content addressing various customer tastes and preferences. In addition, our customer base attracts advertisers and game publishers seeking affluent markets where customers have adequate disposable income to purchase their products and services. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Employees . We have attracted and retained employees with solid educational and professional credentials who are passionate about Zedge and its mission to serve as a medium for self-expression.

&#160; 

&#9679; Continue growing our user base, globally . We expect to continue devoting material resources in growing our user base by: &#160;

&#9679; studying user needs and enhancing our flagship Zedge app to meet those needs; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; selectively and opportunistically implementing user acquisition campaigns; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; expanding into new markets by localizing and collaborating with regionally relevant strategic partners; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; developing and offering new and exciting products and services that extend beyond our current flagship app. &#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; Increase usage and retention . We plan on investing in projects and enhancements that will increase customer usage and user retention. We may forge relationships with content holders or strategic partners interested in gaining access to our customer base in exchange for timely and premium content that is of value to our users or that we develop new and enhanced products and mechanisms for engaging with our customer base. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Ongoing product and technology investment . We plan to make continued investment in the core product feature sets and functionalities that have positioned us as a leader in the personalization space. In addition, we will invest in new technology initiatives that we believe will provide value to our users. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Increase our marketing efforts . Historically, we haven&#8217;t invested materially in marketing initiatives. Going forward, we envision the need to better promote our brand and amplify our voice. We also envisage entering into commercial relationships with major brands, movie studios, music labels and pop culture influencers to enhance our value proposition. Furthermore, we will also invest in app store optimization, search, marketing automation, social marketing and community management in order to retain and expand our customer base. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Improve monetization . We will continue exploring additional monetization methods including in-app purchases, subscription models, e-commerce, new advertising products and brand sponsorships. We believe that our large and expanding customer base is an attractive medium for advertisers, brands and content holders and this will generate new monetization opportunities over time. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Selectively pursue strategic investments and acquisitions . On a selective basis we will look to invest in or purchase entities that can provide synergistic growth opportunities. Our acquisition of Sincerial AS, in 2010, served as the cornerstone of our focus on data driven content recommendations, one of our strategic advantages. We plan to leverage our understanding of the industry and pursue opportunities that we believe can have a material positive impact on our business. &#160;

Our History 

&#160; 

In 2003, Tom Arnoy, Kenneth Sundnes and Paul Shaw launched a consumer website that people could use to upload and download ringtones. Traffic to the website grew, primarily by word of mouth, drawing customers from the emerging markets. In December 2006, IDT acquired 90% of Zedge Limited, a UK-based company. Zedge Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2008. On September 18, 2008, Zedge Limited, Tom Arnoy, Kenneth Sundnes and IDT entered into a Conversion Agreement, converting the equity in Zedge Ltd. to Zedge Holdings, Inc. and on September 23, 2008, IDT purchased 94,750 shares of Zedge Holdings&#8217; Series B Preferred Stock for $1,000,000. 

&#160; 

In 2010, IDT and Shaman II, L.P. invested an additional $1.7 million in Zedge Holdings, Inc. Over a two-year period in 2011 and 2012, IDT and Shaman II, L.P. invested an additional $2.35 million in Zedge Holdings, Inc. In January 2016, Zedge Holdings, Inc.&#8217;s name was changed to Zedge, Inc. 

&#160; 

In late 2009, we introduced our Android app. The app provided ease-of-use by negating the need for the customer to first download a ringtone or wallpaper to their computer and then upload that content to their mobile phone. 

&#160; 

In late 2011, Tom Arnoy was promoted to our Chief Executive Officer and Jonathan Reich was retained as our Chief Operating Officer. We improved our underlying technology. We launched our iOS app in 2013, followed by launch of our Windows Mobile app in 2014. 

&#160; 

During 2014 and 2015, our Zedge app introduced app icons, social sharing features and marketing automation capabilities. In addition, we began localizing our app by not only expanding the number of languages it supported but also by launching localized versions of its Google Play listings. As of July 31, 2016, Zedge is available in the following 11 languages: Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Indonesian. 

&#160; 

Our Technology 

&#160; 

Zedge has developed a scalable distributed platform that is comprised of both open source and proprietary technologies centered on content management and discovery, web and app development, data mining and analytics, deep learning, mobile content/device compatibility, advertising and reporting. From an end user&#8217;s perspective, the platform minimizes response latency while maximizing content relevancy and discoverability. We optimize by utilizing systems, algorithms and heuristics that organize the content based upon real user data and that render the content in a relevant fashion. Zedge&#8217;s architecture provides a fully redundant production environment that can tolerate multiple server failures with minimal end-user disruption. It utilizes a variety of bare-metal and cloud-hosted servers; a mix that we find gives the right balance between performance, scalability, flexibility, cost and ease of use.

Competition 

&#160; 

Zedge faces competition across many different fronts including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Mobile personalization products . Generally, we compete with other mobile app developers. More specifically, ringtones, wallpapers and app icons are a commodity, and many smaller app developers and websites offer both free and paid ringtones, wallpapers and app icons. In addition, Android app launchers offer users a limited set of similar personalization options when compared to Zedge. We believe that Zedge has a competitive advantage in this space due to its large user base, its modular approach that allows the customer to selectively choose what they would like to personalize without handing over the core elements of the native operating system to a third party and overwhelming the user with a myriad of complex options, its large content catalogue, its proprietary recommendation engine, its market ranking and its longevity. We are unaware of any service that hosts a content library as extensive as Zedge&#8217;s library, or that curates the content in such a relevant and easy-to-use fashion. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Advertisers . We face significant competition for advertising spend from both digital media providers and traditional media outlets, including television, radio and print. &#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, proprietary technology, knowhow and other intellectual property are vital to our success. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other countries, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees and business partners. The agreements we enter into with our employees also provide that all software, inventions, developments, works of authorship and trade secrets created by them during the course of their employment are our property. 

&#160; 

We have been granted trademark protection for &#8220;Zedge&#8221; in the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada and for &#8220;Tonesync&#8221; in the United States and European Union. We also have applied for trademark protection for &#8220;We make phones personal&#8221;, &#8220;Tattoo your phone&#8221; and &#8220;Zedge Snakk&#8221; in the United States and &#8220;Zedge&#8221; in India as well as for copyright protection for our flagship app, Zedge. In addition, we have registered, amongst others, the following domain names: zedge.net and zedge.com . 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of July 31, 2016, we had 54 full time employees. 

&#160; 

Facilities 

&#160; 

Our principal executive office is located in a leased premise comprising approximately 500 square feet of space in New York City. This location currently houses commercial operations including sales, marketing, business development and ad operations. Our Trondheim, Norway facility with approximately 11,000 square feet of space accommodates our product, design and technology teams and is under lease through 2018. We entered into a lease in October 2014 for approximately 400 square feet of office space in Helsinki, Finland, where we employ a satellite development center. Our servers are hosted in leased data centers in different geographic locations in the U.S. These data centers are owned and maintained by a third-party data center provider.
