 Item 1 - Business 

(a) General Description of Business. &#32;Old Republic International Corporation is a Chicago based holding company engaged in the single business of insurance underwriting and related services. It conducts its operations principally through a number of regulated insurance company subsidiaries organized into three major segments, namely, it's General Insurance Group (property and liability insurance), Title Insurance Group, and the Republic Financial Indemnity Group ("RFIG") (mortgage guaranty ("MI") and consumer credit indemnity ("CCI")) Run-off Business. References herein to such groups apply to the Company's subsidiaries engaged in these respective segments of business. The results of a small life and accident insurance business are included within the corporate and other caption of this report. "Old Republic" or "the Company" refers to Old Republic International Corporation and its subsidiaries as the context requires. 

The insurance business is distinguished from most others in that the prices (premiums) charged for various insurance products are set without certainty of the ultimate benefit and claim costs that will emerge or be incurred, often many years after issuance and expiration of a policy. This basic fact casts Old Republic as a risk-taking enterprise managed for the long run. Management therefore conducts the business with a primary focus on achieving favorable underwriting results over cycles, and on the maintenance of financial soundness in support of the insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to insurance beneficiaries. To achieve these objectives, adherence to insurance risk management principles is stressed, and asset diversification and quality are emphasized. The underwriting principles encompass: 

&#8226; 

Disciplined risk selection, evaluation, and pricing to reduce uncertainty and adverse selection; 

&#8226; 

Enhancing the predictability of expected outcomes through insurance of the largest number of homogeneous risks as to each type of coverage; 

&#8226; 

Reducing the insurance portfolio risk profile through: 

&#8226; 

diversification and spread of insured risks; and 

&#8226; 

assimilation of uncorrelated asset and liability exposures across economic sectors that tend to offset or counterbalance one another; and 

&#8226; 

Effective management of gross and net limits of liability through appropriate use of reinsurance. 

In addition to income arising from Old Republic's basic underwriting and related services functions, significant investment income is earned from invested funds generated by those functions and from shareholders' capital. Investment management aims for stability of income from interest and dividends, protection of capital, and for sufficiency of liquidity to meet insurance underwriting and other obligations as they become payable in the future. Securities trading and the realization of capital gains are not objectives. The investment philosophy is therefore best characterized as emphasizing value, credit quality, and relatively long-term holding periods. The Company's ability to hold both fixed maturity and equity securities for long periods of time is in turn enabled by the scheduling of maturities in contemplation of an appropriate matching of assets and liabilities, and by investments in large capitalization equity securities with necessary market liquidity. 

In light of the above factors, the Company's affairs are necessarily managed for the long-run and without significant regard to the arbitrary strictures of quarterly or even annual reporting periods that American industry must observe. In Old Republic's view, such short reporting time frames do not comport well with the long-term nature of much of its business. Management believes that the Company's operating results and financial condition can best be evaluated by observing underwriting and overall operating performance trends over succeeding five or preferably ten year intervals. A ten year period in particular can likely encompass at least one economic and/or underwriting cycle and thereby provide an appropriate time frame for such cycle to run its course, for premium rate changes to emerge in financial results, and for reserved claim costs to be quantified with greater finality and effect. 

The contributions to consolidated net revenues and income before taxes, and the assets and shareholders' equity of each Old Republic segment are set forth in the following table. This information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and the "Management Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations" appearing elsewhere in this report.

General Insurance Group 

Old Republic's General Insurance segment is best characterized as a commercial lines insurance business with a strong focus on liability insurance coverages. Most of these coverages are provided to businesses, government, and other institutions. The Company does not have a meaningful exposure to personal lines insurance such as homeowners and private automobile coverages, nor does it insure significant amounts of commercial or other real property. In continuance of its commercial lines orientation, Old Republic also focuses on specific sectors of the North American economy, most prominently the transportation (trucking and general aviation), commercial construction, healthcare, education, retail and wholesale trade, forest products, energy, general manufacturing, and financial services industries. In managing the insurance risks it undertakes, the Company employs various underwriting and loss mitigation techniques such as utilization of policy deductibles, captive insurance risk-sharing arrangements, and retrospective rating and policyholder dividend plans. These underwriting techniques are intended to better correlate premium charges with the ultimate claims experience of individual or groups of assureds. 

Over the years, the General Insurance Group's operations have been developed steadily through a combination of internal growth, the establishment of additional subsidiaries focused on new types of coverages and/or industry sectors, and through several mergers of smaller companies. As a result, this segment has become widely diversified with a business base encompassing the following major coverages: 

Automobile Extended Warranty Insurance (1992): &#32;Coverage is provided to the vehicle owner for certain mechanical or electrical repair or replacement costs after the manufacturer's warranty has expired. 

Aviation (1983): &#32; Insurance policies protect the value of aircraft hulls and afford liability coverage for acts that result in injury, loss of life, and property damage to passengers and others on the ground or in the air. 

Commercial Automobile Insurance (1930's): &#32; Covers vehicles (mostly trucks) used principally in commercial pursuits. Policies cover damage to insured vehicles and liabilities incurred by an assured for bodily injury and property damage sustained by third parties. 

Commercial Multi-Peril ("CMP")(1920's): &#32; Policies afford liability coverage for claims arising from the acts of owners or employees, and protection for the physical assets of businesses. 

Financial Indemnity: &#32;Multiple types of specialty coverages, including most prominently the following four, are underwritten by Old Republic within this financial indemnity products classification. 

Errors &#38; Omissions("E&#38;O")/Directors &#38; Officers ("D&#38;O")(1983): &#32; E&#38;O &#32; liability policies are written for non-medical professional service providers such as lawyers, architects, and consultants, and provide coverage for legal expenses, and indemnity settlements for claims alleging breaches of professional standards. D&#38;O coverage provides for the payment of legal expenses, and indemnity settlements for claims made against the directors and officers of corporations from a variety of sources, most typically shareholders. 

Fidelity (1981): &#32;Bonds cover the exposures of financial institutions and commercial and other enterprises for losses of monies or debt and equity securities due to acts of employee dishonesty. 

Guaranteed Asset Protection ("GAP")(2003): &#32; This &#32; insurance indemnifies an automobile loan borrower for the dollar value difference between an insurance company's liability for the total loss (remaining cash value) of an insured vehicle and the amount still owed on an automobile loan. 

Surety (1981): &#32;Bonds are insurance company guarantees of performance by a corporate principal or individual such as for the completion of a building or road project, or payment on various types of contracts. 

General Liability (1920's): &#32;Protects against liability of an assured which stems from carelessness, negligence, or failure to act, and results in property damage or personal injury to others. 

Home Warranty Insurance (1981): &#32; This product provides repair and/or replacement coverage for home systems (e.g. plumbing, heating, and electrical) and designated appliances. 

Inland Marine (1920's): &#32; Coverage pertains to the insurance of property in transit over land and of property which is mobile by nature. 

Travel Accident (1970): &#32;Coverages provided under these policies, some of which are also underwritten by the Company's Canadian life insurance affiliate, cover monetary losses arising from trip delay and cancellation for individual insureds. 

Workers' Compensation (1910's): &#32;This coverage is purchased by employers to provide insurance for employees' lost wages and medical benefits in the event of work-related injury, disability, or death. 

______ 

&#32;&#32;(Parenthetical dates refer to the year(s) when Old Republic's Companies began underwriting the coverages) 

______ 

Commercial automobile, general liability and workers' compensation insurance policy coverages are typically produced in tandem for many assureds. For 2015 , production of workers' compensation direct insurance premiums accounted for approximately 36.4% &#32;of consolidated General Insurance Group direct premiums written, while commercial automobile and general liability direct premium production amounted to approximately 28.3% &#32;and 11.3% , respectively, of such consolidated totals. 

Approximately 91% &#32;of general insurance premiums are produced through independent agency or brokerage channels, while the remaining 9% &#32;is obtained through direct production facilities. 

Title Insurance Group 

Old Republic's flagship title insurance company was founded in 1907. The Title Insurance Group's business consists primarily of the issuance of policies to real estate purchasers and investors based upon searches of the public records which contain information concerning interests in real property. The policies insure against losses arising out of defects, liens and encumbrances affecting the insured title and not excluded or excepted from the coverage of the policy. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 27% &#32;of the Company's consolidated title premium and related fee income stemmed from direct operations (which include branch offices of its title insurers and wholly owned agency and service subsidiaries of the Company), while the remaining 73% &#32;emanated from independent title agents and underwritten title companies. 

There are two basic types of title insurance policies: lenders' policies and owners' policies. Both are issued for a one-time premium. Most mortgages made in the United States are extended by mortgage bankers, savings and commercial banks, state and federal agencies, and life insurance companies. These financial institutions secure title insurance policies to protect their mortgagees' interest in the real property. This protection remains in effect for as long as the mortgagee has an interest in the property. A separate title insurance policy may be issued to the owner of the real estate. An owner's policy of title insurance protects an owner's interest in the title to the property. 

The premiums charged for the issuance of title insurance policies vary with the policy amount and the type of policy issued. The premium is collected in full when the real estate transaction is closed, there being no recurring fee thereafter. In many areas, premiums charged on subsequent policies on the same property may be reduced depending generally upon the time elapsed between issuance of the previous policies and the nature of the transactions for which the policies are issued. Most of the charge to the customer relates to title services rendered in conjunction with the issuance of a policy rather than to the possibility of loss due to risks insured against. Accordingly, the cost of services performed by a title insurer relates for the most part to the prevention of loss rather than to the assumption of the risk of loss. Claim losses that do occur result primarily from title search and examination mistakes, fraud, forgery, incapacity, missing heirs and escrow processing errors. 

In connection with its title insurance operations, Old Republic also provides escrow closing and construction disbursement services, as well as real estate information products, national default management services, and a variety of other services pertaining to real estate transfers and loan transactions. 

Republic Financial Indemnity Group (RFIG) Run-off Business 

Old Republic's RFIG run-off business consists of its mortgage guaranty and CCI operations. 

Private mortgage insurance protects mortgage lenders and investors from default related losses on residential mortgage loans made primarily to homebuyers who make down payments of less than 20% of the home's purchase price. The mortgage guaranty operation insures only first mortgage loans, primarily on residential properties incorporating one-to-four family dwelling units. Old Republic's mortgage guaranty business was started in 1973. 

There are two principal types of private mortgage insurance coverage: "primary" and "pool". Primary mortgage insurance provides mortgage default protection on individual loans and covers a stated percentage of the unpaid loan principal, delinquent interest, and certain expenses associated with the default and subsequent foreclosure. In lieu of paying the stated coverage percentage, the Company may pay the entire claim amount, take title to the mortgaged property, and subsequently sell the property to mitigate its loss. Pool insurance, which is written on a group of loans in negotiated transactions, provides coverage that ranges up to 100% of the net loss on each individual loan included in the pool, subject to provisions regarding deductibles, caps on individual exposures, and aggregate stop loss provisions which limit aggregate losses to a specified percentage of the total original balances of all loans in the pool. 

Traditional primary insurance was issued on an individual loan basis to mortgage bankers, brokers, commercial banks and savings institutions through a network of Company-managed underwriting sites located throughout the country. Traditional primary loans were individually reviewed (except for loans insured under delegated underwriting programs) and priced according to filed premium rates. In underwriting traditional primary business, the Company generally adhered to the underwriting guidelines published by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac both of which were purchasers of many of the loans the Company insured. Delegated underwriting programs allowed approved lenders to commit the Company to insure loans provided they adhered to predetermined underwriting guidelines. 

Bulk and other insurance was issued on groups of loans to mortgage banking customers through a centralized risk assessment and underwriting department. These groups of loans were priced in the aggregate on a bid or negotiated basis. Coverage for insurance issued in this manner was provided through primary insurance policies (loan level 

coverage) or pool insurance policies (aggregate coverage). The Company considers transactions designated as bulk insurance to be exposed to higher risk (as determined by such characteristics as origination channel, loan amount, credit quality, and extent of loan documentation) than those designated as other insurance. 

Before insuring any loans, the Company issued to each approved customer a master policy outlining the terms and conditions under which coverage would be provided. Primary business was then produced via the issuance of a commitment/certificate for each loan submitted and approved for insurance. In the case of business providing pool coverage, a separate pool insurance policy was issued covering the particular loans applicable to each transaction. 

As to all types of mortgage insurance products, the amount of premium charge depended on various underwriting criteria such as loan-to-value ratios, the level of coverage being provided, the borrower's credit history, the type of loan instrument (whether fixed rate/fixed payment or an adjustable rate/adjustable payment), documentation type, and whether or not the insured property is categorized as an investment or owner occupied property. Coverage is non-cancelable by the Company (except in the case of non-payment of premium or certain master policy violations) and premiums are paid under single, annual, or monthly payment plans. Single premiums are paid at the inception of coverage and provide coverage for the entire policy term. Annual and monthly premiums are renewable on their anniversary dates with the premium charge determined on the basis of the original or outstanding loan amount. The majority of the Company's direct premiums were written under monthly premium plans. Premiums may be paid by borrowers as part of their monthly mortgage payment and passed through to the Company by the servicer of the loan, or paid directly by the originator of, or investor in the mortgage loan. 

As reported in earlier periods, the Company's flagship mortgage guaranty insurance carrier, Republic Mortgage Insurance Company ("RMIC"), had been operating pursuant to a waiver of minimum state regulatory capital requirements since late 2009. This waiver expired on August 31, 2011 and, as a consequence, RMIC and its sister company Republic Insurance Company of North Carolina ("RMICNC"), discontinued writing new business in all states and limited themselves to servicing the run-off of their existing business. They were placed under the North Carolina Department of Insurance's ("NCDOI") administrative supervision the following year and ultimately ordered to defer the payment of 40% &#32;of all settled claims as a deferred payment obligation ("DPO"). 

On July 1, 2014, the NCDOI issued a Final Order approving an Amended and Restated Corrective Plan (the "Amended Plan") submitted jointly on April 16, 2014, by RMIC and RMICNC. Under the Amended Plan, RMIC and RMICNC were authorized to pay 100% &#32;of their DPOs accrued as of June 30, 2014, and to settle all subsequent valid claims entirely in cash, without establishing any DPOs. In anticipation of receiving this Final Order, ORI contributed $125.0 million &#32;in cash and securities to RMIC in June 2014. In mid-July 2014, in furtherance of the Final Order, RMIC and RMICNC processed payments of their accumulated DPO balances of approximately $657.0 &#32;million relating to fully settled claims charged to periods extending between January 19, 2012 and June 30, 2014. Both subsidiaries remain under the supervision of the NCDOI as they continue to operate in run-off mode. The approval of the Amended Plan notwithstanding, the NCDOI retains its regulatory supervisory powers to review and amend the terms of the Amended Plan in the future as circumstances may warrant. 

RMIC has continually evaluated the potential long-term underwriting performance of the run-off book of business based on various modeling techniques. The resulting models take into account actual premium and paid claim experience of prior periods, together with a large number of assumptions and judgments about future outcomes that are highly sensitive to a wide range of estimates. Many of these estimates and underlying assumptions relate to matters over which the Company has no control, including: 1) The conflicted interests, as well as the varying mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices of a large number of insured lending institutions; 2) General economic and industry-specific trends and events; and 3) The evolving or future social and economic policies of the U.S. Government vis-&#224;-vis such critical sectors as the banking, mortgage lending, and housing industries, as well as its policies for resolving the insolvencies and assigning a possible future role to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These matters notwithstanding, RMIC's standard model of forecasted results extending through 2022 continues to reflect ultimate profitability for the book of business. In this regard a long-used RMIC standard model indicates that underwriting performance of the book of business should, in the aggregate, be positive over the extended ten year run-off period assumed to end on or about December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2015 , it is nonetheless possible that MI operating results could be negative in the near term. 

&#32;As of December 31, 2015 , RFIG's mortgage insurance subsidiaries were eminently solvent. Their total statutory capital, inclusive of a contingency reserve of $265.8 million , was $311.0 million . As of the same date, RFIG's consolidated GAAP capitalization amounted to $247.2 million . 

CCI policies, which have been issued by the Company since 1954, provide limited indemnity coverage to lenders and other financial intermediaries. The coverage is for the risk of non-payment of loan balances by individual buyers and borrowers. Claim costs are typically affected by unemployment, bankruptcy, and other issues leading to failures to pay. During 2008, the Company ceased the underwriting of new policies and the existing book of business was placed in run-off operating mode. During 2015 and 2014 in particular, CCI underwriting performance was affected negatively by significant litigation costs arising from claims by and against one of the nation's major banking institutions. 

Corporate and Other Operations 

Corporate and other operations include the accounts of a small life and accident insurance business as well as those of the parent holding company and several minor corporate services subsidiaries that perform investment management, 

payroll, administrative and minor marketing services. The life and accident business registered net premium revenues of $19.4 &#32;million, $60.7 &#32;million, and $59.6 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. This business is conducted in both the United States and Canada and consists mostly of limited product offerings sold through financial intermediaries such as automobile dealers, travel agents, and marketing channels that are also utilized in some of Old Republic's general insurance operations. For 2015, the much lower life and accident premium volume reflects the transfer of accident insurance premiums from a life and accident subsidiary to a general insurance group affiliate. Production of term life insurance, accounting for net premiums earned of $10.3 &#32;million, $11.9 &#32;million, and $13.0 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, was terminated and placed in run off as of year end 2004.

Net Premiums Earned 

General insurance 2015 and 2014 earned premium revenues rose for most insurance coverages with production spurred by both new business and a continuation of strong renewal rates for existing business. The Company's targeted insurance underwriting services in such fields as aviation, construction, energy, home warranty, trucking, and large account risk management provided the main impetus to this growth. The combination of a generally improving rate environment for most coverages and the slowly strengthening pace of U.S. economic activity were major contributing factors in these regards. 

Title insurance premiums and fees increased in 2015 due to stronger housing and commercial property transactions and the segment's expanded market share. The decline in premium and fees in 2014 was mainly caused by the significant drop in refinance transactions from higher levels reached in 2013. 

RFIG Run-off earned premium volume has reflected a continuing decline since 2012 due to the natural outcome of a run-off book of business devoid of new premium production since at least 2011. 

Claim Ratios 

Variations in claim ratios are typically caused by changes in the frequency and severity of claims incurred, changes in premium rates and the level of premium refunds, and periodic changes in claim and claim expense reserve estimates resulting from ongoing reevaluations of reported and incurred but not reported claims and claim expenses. As demonstrated in the preceding table, the Company can therefore experience period-to-period volatility in the underwriting results posted for individual coverages. In light of Old Republic's basic underwriting focus in managing its business, a long-term objective has been to dampen this volatility by diversifying coverages offered and industries served. 

The claim ratios include loss adjustment expenses where appropriate. Policyholders' dividends, which apply principally to workers' compensation insurance, are a reflection of changes in loss experience for individual or groups of policies, rather than overall results, and should be viewed in conjunction with loss ratio trends. 

The overall general insurance &#32;2015 claim ratio reflects lower expense provisions for current and prior years' claim occurrences. Prior years' loss reserve developments resulted in an increase of 1.5 and 3.9 percentage points in the claim ratio in 2015 and 2014, respectively. By contrast, 2013 loss development reduced the claim ratio by .9 percentage point. Adverse developments have been concentrated in workers' compensation and general liability case reserves and resulted from settlements or reserve additions exceeding the previously established indemnity and/or allocated loss adjustment expense provisions. The Company generally underwrites concurrently workers' compensation, commercial automobile (liability and physical damage), and general liability insurance coverages for a large number of customers. Given this concurrent underwriting approach, an evaluation of trends in premiums, claim and dividend ratios for these individual coverages is more appropriately considered for the aggregate of these coverages. 

Claims are a major cost factor and changes in them reflect continually evolving pricing and risk selection together with variability in loss severity and frequency trends caused by fortuitous and other events. Changes in commercial automobile claim ratios are primarily due to fluctuations in claim frequencies. Loss ratios for workers' compensation and liability insurance can reflect greater variability due to chance events in any one year, changes in loss costs emanating from participation in involuntary markets (i.e. insurance assigned risk pools and associations in which participation is basically mandatory), and added provisions for loss costs not recoverable from assuming reinsurers which may experience financial difficulties from time to time. Additionally, workers' compensation claim costs in particular are affected by a variety of underwriting techniques such as the use of captive reinsurance retentions, retrospective premium plans, and self-insured or deductible insurance programs that are intended to mitigate claim costs over time. Claim ratios for a relatively small book of general liability coverages tend to be highly volatile year to year due to the impact of changes in claim emergence and severity of legacy asbestos and environmental claims exposures. 

Title insurance &#32;loss ratios have remained in the low single digits for a number of years due to a continuation of favorable trends in claims frequency and severity. 

The RFIG Run-off - mortgage guaranty &#32; 2015 claim ratio was adversely affected by greater provisions for disputed claims in litigation. Excluding the affects of the litigation expense provisions, the claim ratios continue to decline due to the combined effects of further reductions in newly reported defaults and a rising rate at which previously reported defaults have cured or otherwise been resolved without payment. These factors led to highly favorable developments of prior year-end claim reserves during 2015, 2014, and 2013. Setting aside the aforementioned litigation expense provisions in 2015, these favorable reserve developments accounted for reductions of 65.0, 69.3, and 88.2 percentage points in the reported claim ratio for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

RFIG Run-off - CCI results were negatively impacted in 2015 and 2014 as ongoing litigation costs burdened this portion of the RFIG Run-off Business. The loss in 2015, however, was much lower than that registered in 2014 as the latter period was affected by greater net reserve provisions to cover the final settlement of a litigated case, as well as ongoing claim litigation with a major banking institution. 2013 CCI performance was most favorably affected by lower claim provisions resulting from improving delinquency trends and greater than anticipated claim salvage recoveries. 

The consolidated &#32;claim, expense, and composite ratios reflect all the above factors and the changing period-to-period contributions of each segment to consolidated results. 

General Insurance Claim Reserves 

The Company's property and liability insurance subsidiaries establish claim reserves which consist of estimates to settle: a) reported claims; b) claims which have been incurred as of each balance sheet date but have not as yet been reported ("IBNR") to the insurance subsidiaries; and c) the direct costs, (fees and costs which are allocable to individual claims) and indirect costs (such as salaries and rent applicable to the overall management of claim departments) to administer known and IBNR claims. Such claim reserves, except as to classification in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as to gross and reinsured portions and purchase accounting adjustments, are reported for financial and regulatory reporting purposes at amounts that are substantially the same. 

The establishment of claim reserves by the Company's insurance subsidiaries is a reasonably complex and dynamic process influenced by a large variety of factors. These factors principally include past experience applicable to the anticipated costs of various types of claims, continually evolving and changing legal theories emanating from the judicial system, recurring accounting, statistical, and actuarial studies, the professional experience and expertise of the Company's claim departments' personnel or attorneys and independent claim adjusters, ongoing changes in claim frequency or severity patterns such as those caused by natural disasters, illnesses, accidents, work-related injuries, and changes in general and industry-specific economic conditions. Consequently, the reserves established are a reflection of the opinions of a large number of persons, of the application and interpretation of historical precedent and trends, of expectations as to future developments, and of management's judgment in interpreting all such factors. At any point in time, the Company is exposed to the incurrence of possibly higher or lower than anticipated claim costs due to all of these factors, and to the evolution, interpretation, and expansion of tort law, as well as the effects of unexpected jury verdicts. 

In establishing claim reserves, the possible increase in future loss settlement costs caused by inflation is considered implicitly, along with the many other factors cited above. Reserves are generally set to provide for the ultimate cost of all claims. With regard to workers' compensation reserves, however, the ultimate cost of long-term disability or pension type claims is discounted to present value based on interest rates ranging from 3.5% &#32;to 4.0% . Where applicable, the Company uses only such discounted reserves in evaluating the results of its operations, in pricing its products and settling retrospective and reinsured accounts, in evaluating policy terms and experience, and for other general business purposes. Solely to comply with reporting rules mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, however, Old Republic has made statistical studies of applicable workers' compensation reserves to obtain estimates of the amounts by which claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance, have been discounted. These studies have resulted in estimates of such amounts at $228.6 &#32;million, $240.7 &#32;million and $241.4 &#32;million, as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. It should be noted, however, that these differences between discounted and non-discounted (terminal) reserves are fundamentally of an informational nature, and are not indicative of an effect on operating results for any one or series of years for the above noted reasons. 

Early in 2001, the Federal Department of Labor revised the Federal Black Lung Program regulations. The revisions basically require a reevaluation of previously settled, denied, or new occupational disease claims in the context of newly devised, more lenient standards when such claims are resubmitted. Following a number of challenges and appeals by the insurance and coal mining industries, the revised regulations were, for the most part, upheld in June, 2002 and are to be applied prospectively. Since the final quarter of 2001, black lung claims filed or refiled pursuant to these revised regulations have increased, though the volume of new claim reports has abated in recent years. 

In March 2010, federal regulations were revised once again as part of the Patient Protection and Affordability Act that reinstates two provisions that can potentially benefit claimants. In response to this most recent legislation and the above noted 2001 change, black lung claims filed or refiled have risen once again. The vast majority of claims filed to date against Old Republic pertain to business underwritten through loss sensitive programs that permit the charge of additional or refund of return premiums to wholly or partially offset changes in estimated claim costs, or to business underwritten as a service carrier on behalf of various industry-wide involuntary market (i.e. assigned risk) pools. A much 

smaller portion pertains to business produced on a traditional risk transfer basis. The Company has established applicable reserves for claims as they have been reported and for claims not as yet reported on the basis of its historical experience as well as assumptions relative to the effect of the revised regulations. Inasmuch as a variety of challenges are likely as the revised regulations are implemented through the actual claim settlement process, the potential impact on reserves, gross and net of reinsurance or retrospective premium adjustments, resulting from such regulations cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty. 

Old Republic's reserve estimates also include provisions for indemnity and settlement costs for various asbestosis and environmental impairment ("A&#38;E") claims that have been filed in the normal course of business against a number of its insurance subsidiaries. Many such claims relate to policies issued prior to 1985, including many issued during a short period between 1981 and 1982 pursuant to an agency agreement canceled in 1982. Over the years, the Company's property and liability insurance subsidiaries have typically issued general liability insurance policies with face amounts ranging between $1.0 &#32;million and $2.0 &#32;million and rarely exceeding $10.0 &#32;million. Such policies have, in turn, been subject to reinsurance cessions which have typically reduced the subsidiaries' net retentions to $.5 &#32;million or less as to each claim. Old Republic's exposure to A&#38;E claims cannot, however, be calculated by conventional insurance reserving methods for a variety of reasons, including: a) the absence of statistically valid data inasmuch as such claims typically involve long reporting delays and very often uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds against whom such claims have arisen or will arise; and b) the litigation history of such or similar claims for insurance industry members which has produced inconsistent court decisions with regard to such questions as to when an alleged loss occurred, which policies provide coverage, how a loss is to be allocated among potentially responsible insureds and/or their insurance carriers, how policy coverage exclusions are to be interpreted, what types of environmental impairment or toxic tort claims are covered, when the insurer's duty to defend is triggered, how policy limits are to be calculated, and whether clean-up costs constitute property damage. Over time, the Executive Branch and/or the Congress of the United States have proposed or considered changes in the legislation and rules affecting the determination of liability for environmental and asbestosis claims. As of December 31, 2015 , however, there is no solid evidence to suggest that possible future changes might mitigate or reduce some or all of these claim exposures. Because of the above issues and uncertainties, estimation of reserves for losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses for A&#38;E claims in particular is much more difficult or impossible to quantify with a high degree of precision. Accordingly, no representation can be made that the Company's reserves for such claims and related costs will not prove to be overstated or understated in the future. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , Old Republic's aggregate indemnity and loss adjustment expense reserves specifically identified with A&#38;E exposures amounted to approximately $130.9 &#32;million and $128.8 &#32;million gross, respectively, and $100.6 &#32;million and $106.2 &#32;million net of reinsurance, respectively. Based on average annual claims payments during the five most recent calendar years, such reserves represented a paid loss survival ratio of 4.7 &#32;years (gross) and 6.2 &#32;years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 4.5 &#32;years (gross) and 6.1 &#32;years (net of reinsurance) as of December 31, 2014 . These 2014 survival ratios are presented on a pro forma basis (unaudited) as if PMA had been consolidated with ORI for all periods. Fluctuations in this ratio between years can be caused by the inconsistent pay out patterns associated with these types of claims. For the five years ended December 31, 2015 , incurred A&#38;E claim and related loss settlement costs have averaged .4% &#32;of average annual General Insurance Group claims and related settlement costs. 

&#160; 

Over the years, the subject of property and liability insurance claim reserves has been written about and analyzed extensively by a large number of professionals and regulators. Accordingly, the above discussion summary should be regarded as a basic outline of the subject and not as a definitive presentation. The Company believes that its overall reserving practices have been consistently applied over many years, and that its aggregate reserves have generally resulted in reasonable approximations of the ultimate net costs of claims incurred. However, no representation is made nor is any guaranty given that ultimate net claim and related costs will not develop in future years to be greater or lower than currently established reserve estimates. 

The following table shows the evolving redundancies or deficiencies for reserves established as of December 31, of each of the years 2005 &#32;through 2015 .

(7) 

CCI coverages have been fully retained in this historical table for all years presented. In connection with the previously noted MI/CCI combination, certain General Insurance Group companies retain losses pursuant to various quota share and stop loss reinsurance agreements. 

In reviewing the preceding tabular data, it should be noted that prior periods' loss payment and development trends may not be repeated in the future due to the large variety of factors influencing the reserving and settlement processes outlined herein above. The reserve redundancies or deficiencies shown for all years are not necessarily indicative of the effect on reported results of any one or series of years since cumulative retrospective premium and commission adjustments employed in various parts of the Company's business may partially offset such effects. (See "Consolidated Underwriting Statistics" above, and "Reserves, Reinsurance, and Retrospective Adjustments" elsewhere herein). 

In 2015 and 2014, the Company experienced unfavorable developments of previously established reserves for accidents or events which occurred in 2011 and prior years in particular. These adverse developments were concentrated in workers' compensation and general liability case reserves and resulted from settlements or reserve additions exceeding the previously established indemnity and/or allocated loss adjustment expense provisions. These adverse developments are reflected in the percentage deficiencies shown in the columns for 2011 to 2014 and in the lower redundancies shown in the columns for 2009 and 2010. 

The following table shows an analysis of changes in aggregate reserves for the Company's property and liability insurance claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses for each of the years shown:

(1) CCI coverages have been fully retained in this historical table for all years presented. For segment reporting purposes, $155.1 million, $107.7 million, and $66.2 million of ending net reserves reported in the above table are reported as part of the RFIG Run-off Business segment as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In connection with the previously noted MI/CCI combination, certain General Insurance Group companies retain losses pursuant to various quota share and stop loss reinsurance agreements. 

(b) Investments. &#32;In common with other insurance organizations, Old Republic invests most capital and operating funds in income producing securities. Investments must comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations which prescribe the nature, form, quality, and relative amounts of investments which may be made by insurance companies. Generally, these laws and regulations permit insurance companies to invest within varying limitations in state, municipal and federal government obligations, corporate debt, preferred and common stocks, certain types of real estate, and first mortgage loans. For many years, Old Republic's investment policy has therefore been to acquire and retain primarily investment grade, publicly traded, fixed maturity securities, and in more recent years, high yielding publicly traded large capitalization common shares. The investment policy is also influenced by the terms of the insurance coverages written, by its expectations as to the timing of claim and benefit payments, and by income tax considerations. As a consequence of all these factors, the Company's invested assets are managed in consideration of enterprise-wide risk management objectives intended to assure solid funding of its subsidiaries' long-term obligations to insurance policyholders and other beneficiaries, as well as evaluations of their long-term effect on stability of capital accounts. Accordingly, the investment portfolio contains no significant insurance risk-correlated asset exposures to real estate, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations ("CDO's"), derivatives, hybrid securities, or illiquid private equity investments. In a similar vein, the Company does not engage in hedging or securities lending transactions, nor does it invest in securities whose values are predicated on non-regulated financial instruments exhibiting amorphous or unfunded counter-party risk attributes. 

Management considers investment grade fixed maturity securities to be those rated by major credit rating agencies that fall within the top four rating categories, or securities which are not rated but have characteristics similar to securities so rated. The Company had no bond or note investments in default as to principal and/or interest at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . The status and fair value changes of each investment is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis, and estimates of other-than-temporary impairments in the portfolio's value are evaluated and established at each quarterly balance sheet date. Substantially all of the Company's invested assets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;have been classified as "available for sale" pursuant to the existing investment policy. 

The Company's investment policy is not designed to maximize or emphasize the realization of investment gains. The combination of gains and losses from sales or impairments of securities is reflected as realized gains and losses in the income statement. Dispositions of securities result principally from scheduled maturities of bonds and notes and sales of fixed income and equity securities available for sale. Dispositions of securities at a realized gain or loss reflect such factors as ongoing assessments of issuers' business prospects, allocation to industry sectors, changes in credit quality, and tax planning considerations.

(c) Marketing. &#32;Commercial automobile (trucking), workers' compensation and general liability insurance underwritten for business enterprises and public entities is marketed primarily through independent insurance agents and brokers with the assistance of Old Republic's trained sales, underwriting, actuarial, and loss control personnel. The remaining property and liability commercial insurance written by Old Republic is obtained through insurance agents or brokers who are independent contractors and generally represent other insurance companies, and by direct sales. No single source accounted for over 10% of Old Republic's premium volume in 2015 . 

A substantial portion of the Company's title insurance business is referred to it by title insurance agents, builders, lending institutions, real estate developers, realtors, and lawyers. Title insurance and related real estate settlement products are sold through 271 &#32;Company offices and through agencies and underwritten title companies in the District of Columbia and all 50 states. The issuing agents are authorized to issue commitments and title insurance policies based on their own search and examination, or on the basis of abstracts and opinions of approved attorneys. Policies are also issued through independent title companies (not themselves title insurers) pursuant to underwriting agreements. These agreements generally provide that the agency or underwritten company may cause title policies of the Company to be issued, and the latter is responsible under such policies for any payments to the insured. Typically, the agency or underwritten title company deducts the major portion of the title insurance charge to the customer as its commission for services. During 2015 , approximately 73% &#32;of title insurance premiums and fees were accounted for by policies issued by agents and underwritten title companies. 

Title insurance premium and fee revenue is closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market. The volume of real estate activity is affected by the availability and cost of financing, population growth, family movements and other socio-economic factors. Also, the title insurance business is seasonal. During the winter months, new building activity is reduced and, accordingly, the Company produces less title insurance business relative to new construction during such months than during the rest of the year. The most important factors, insofar as Old Republic's title business is concerned, however, are the rates of activity in the resale and refinance markets for residential properties. 

As previously noted, the Company's flagship mortgage guaranty insurance carrier had been operating pursuant to a waiver of minimum state regulatory capital requirements since late 2009. This waiver expired on August 31, 2011. As a consequence, the underwriting of new policies ceased and the existing book of business was placed in run-off operating mode. Prior to August 31, 2011, traditional primary mortgage insurance was marketed principally through a direct sales force which called on mortgage bankers, brokers, commercial banks, savings institutions and other mortgage originators. No sales commissions or other forms of remuneration were paid to the lending institutions or others for the procurement or development of business. 

The personal contacts, relationships, reputations, and intellectual capital of Old Republic's key executives and other associates responsible for the production of business are a vital element in obtaining and retaining much of its business. Many of the Company's customers produce large amounts of premiums and fees and therefore warrant substantial levels of attention and involvement by these persons. In this respect, Old Republic's mode of operation is similar to that of professional reinsurers and commercial insurance brokers, and relies on the marketing, underwriting, and management skills of relatively few key people for large parts of its business. 

Historically, several types of insurance coverages underwritten by Old Republic, such as consumer credit indemnity, title, and mortgage guaranty insurance, have been affected in varying degrees by changes in national economic conditions. During periods when housing activity or mortgage lending are constrained by any combination of rising interest rates, tighter mortgage underwriting guidelines, falling home prices, excess housing supply and/or economic recession, operating and/or claim costs pertaining to such coverages tend to rise disproportionately to revenues and can result in underwriting losses and reduced levels of profitability. 

At least one Old Republic general insurance subsidiary is licensed to do business in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Guam, and each of the Canadian provinces. Title insurance operations are licensed to do business in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. Mortgage insurance subsidiaries are licensed in 50 states and the District of Columbia.

(d) Reserves, Reinsurance, and Retrospective Adjustments. &#32;Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries establish reserves for unearned premiums, reported claims, claims incurred but not reported, and claim adjustment expenses, as required in the circumstances. Such reserves are based on regulatory accounting requirements and generally accepted accounting principles. Claim reserves are based on estimates of the amounts that will be paid over a period of time and changes in such estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the periods during which they occur. See "General Insurance Claim Reserves" herein. 

To maintain premium production within its capacity and limit maximum losses and risks for which it might become liable under its policies, Old Republic, as is the practice in the insurance industry, may cede a portion or all of its premiums and liabilities on certain classes of insurance, individual policies, or blocks of business to other insurers and reinsurers. Although the ceding of insurance does not generally discharge an insurer from its direct liability to a policyholder, it is industry practice to establish the reinsured part of risks as the liability of the reinsurer. Old Republic also employs retrospective premium adjustments and risk sharing arrangements for parts of its business in order to minimize losses for which it might become liable under its insurance policies, and to afford its customers or producers a degree of participation in the risks and rewards associated with such business. Under retrospective arrangements, Old Republic collects additional premiums if losses are greater than originally anticipated and refunds a portion of original premiums if loss costs are lower. Pursuant to risk sharing arrangements, the Company adjusts production costs or premiums retroactively to likewise reflect deviations from originally expected loss costs. The amount of premium, production costs and other retrospective adjustments which may be made is either limited or unlimited depending on the Company's evaluation of risks and related contractual arrangements. To the extent that any reinsurance companies, retrospectively rated risks, or producers might be unable to meet their obligations under existing reinsurance, retrospective insurance and production agreements, Old Republic would be liable for the defaulted amounts. In these regards, however, the Company generally protects itself by withholding funds, by securing indemnity agreements, by obtaining surety bonds, or by otherwise collateralizing such obligations through irrevocable letters of credit, cash, or securities.

Reinsured liabilities of the RFIG Run-off Business, Title Insurance Group and small life and accident insurance operations are not material. 

Reinsurance recoverable asset balances represent amounts due from or credited by assuming reinsurers for paid and unpaid claims and policy reserves. Such reinsurance balances that are recoverable from non-admitted foreign and certain other reinsurers such as captive insurance companies owned by assureds or business producers, as well as similar balances or credits arising from policies that are retrospectively rated or subject to assureds' high deductible retentions are substantially collateralized by letters of credit, securities, and other financial instruments. Old Republic evaluates on a regular basis the financial condition of its assuming reinsurers and assureds who purchase its retrospectively rated or high deductible policies. Estimates of unrecoverable amounts are included in the Company's net claim and claim expense reserves since reinsurance, retrospectively rated and self-insured deductible policies and contracts do not relieve Old Republic from its direct obligations to assureds or their beneficiaries. 

Old Republic's reinsurance practices with respect to portions of its business also result from its desire to bring its sponsoring organizations and customers into some degree of joint venture or risk sharing relationship. The Company may, in exchange for a ceding commission, reinsure up to 100% of the underwriting risk, and the premium applicable to such risk, to insurers owned by or affiliated with lending institutions, financial and other intermediaries, and commercial institutions generally whose customers are insured by Old Republic, or individual customers who have formed captive insurance companies. The ceding commissions received compensate Old Republic for performing the direct insurer's functions of underwriting, actuarial, claim settlement, loss control, legal, reinsurance, and administrative services to comply with local and federal regulations, and for providing appropriate risk management services. 

Remaining portions of Old Republic's business are reinsured in most instances with independent insurance or reinsurance companies pursuant to excess of loss agreements. Except as noted in the following paragraph, reinsurance protection on property and liability coverages generally limits the net loss on most individual claims to a maximum of: $5.2 million &#32;for workers' compensation; $5.0 million &#32;for commercial auto liability; $5.0 million &#32;for general liability; $12.0 million &#32;for executive protection (directors &#38; officers and errors &#38; omissions); $2.0 million &#32;for aviation; and $5.0 million &#32;for property coverages. Title insurance risk assumptions are generally limited to a maximum of $500.0 million &#32;as to any one policy. The vast majority of title policies issued, however, carry exposures of less than $1.0 million . An immaterial amount of the mortgage guaranty traditional primary risk in force is subject to lender sponsored captive reinsurance arrangements structured primarily on an excess of loss basis. All bulk and other mortgage guaranty insurance risk in force is retained. Exclusive of reinsurance, the average direct primary mortgage guaranty exposure is (in whole dollars) $38,700 &#32;per insured loan. 

&#32;Since January 1, 2005, the Company has had maximum reinsurance coverage of up to $200.0 million for its workers' compensation exposures. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, however, all workers' compensation primary insurers such as the Company remain liable for unlimited amounts in excess of reinsured limits. Other than the substantial concentration of workers' compensation losses caused by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, to the best of the Company's knowledge there had not been a similar accumulation of claims in a single location from a single occurrence prior to that event. Nevertheless, the possibility continues to exist that non-reinsured losses could, depending on a wide range of severity and frequency assumptions, aggregate several hundred million dollars to an insurer such as the Company. Such aggregation of losses could occur in the event of a catastrophe such as an earthquake that could lead to the death or injury of a large number of persons concentrated in a single facility such as a high rise building. 

As a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on America, the reinsurance industry eliminated coverage from substantially all contracts for claims arising from acts of terrorism. Primary insurers like the Company thus became fully exposed to such claims. Late in 2002, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (the "TRIA") was signed into law, immediately establishing a temporary federal reinsurance program administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. The program applied to insured commercial property and casualty losses resulting from an act of terrorism, as defined in the TRIA. Congress extended and modified the program in late 2005 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and 

Extension Act of 2005 (the "TRIREA"). TRIREA expired on December 31, 2007. Congress enacted a revised program in December 2007 through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (the "TRIPRA") of 2007, a seven year extension that expired in December 2014. In January 2015, Congress passed the TRIPRA of 2015 that extended TRIPRA through 2020. 

The TRIA automatically voided all policy exclusions which were in effect for terrorism related losses and obligated insurers to offer terrorism coverage with most commercial property and casualty insurance lines. The TRIREA revised the definition of "property and casualty insurance" to exclude commercial automobile, burglary and theft, surety, professional liability and farm owners multi-peril insurance. TRIPRA did not make any further changes to the definition of property and casualty insurance, however, it did include domestic acts of terrorism within the scope of the program. Although insurers are permitted to charge an additional premium for terrorism coverage, insureds may reject the coverage. Under TRIPRA, the program's protection is not triggered for losses arising from an act of terrorism until the industry first suffers losses in excess of a prescribed aggregate deductible during any one year. The program deductible trigger is $100 million, $120 million, $140 million, $160 million, $180 million, and $200 million for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Once the program trigger is met, TRIPRA will be responsible for a fixed percentage of the Company's terrorism losses that exceed its deductible which ranges from 85% for 2015 and declines by one percentage point per year until it reaches 80% in 2020. The Company's deductible amounts to 20% of direct earned premium on eligible property and casualty insurance coverages. The Company currently reinsures limits on a treaty basis of $195.0 million in excess of $5.0 million for claims arising from certain acts of terrorism for casualty clash and catastrophe workers' compensation liability insurance coverages. The Company also purchases facultative reinsurance on certain accounts in excess of $200.0 million to manage the Company's net exposures. 

&#160; 

(e) Competition. &#32;The insurance business is highly competitive and Old Republic competes with many stockholder-owned and mutual insurance companies. Many of these competitors offer more insurance coverages and have substantially greater financial resources than the Company. The rates charged for many of the insurance coverages in which the Company specializes, such as workers' compensation insurance, other property and liability insurance and title insurance, are primarily regulated by the states and are also subject to extensive competition among major insurance organizations. The basic methods of competition available to Old Republic, aside from rates, are service to customers, expertise in tailoring insurance programs to the specific needs of its clients, efficiency and flexibility of operations, personal involvement by its key executives, and, as to title insurance, accuracy and timely delivery of evidences of title issued. 

For certain types of coverages, including loan credit indemnity and mortgage guaranty insurance, the Company has historically competed in varying degrees with the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") and the Veterans Administration ("VA"). In recent years, the FHA's market share of insured mortgages has increased significantly, mostly due to the more restrictive underwriting guidelines and premium rate increases imposed by private mortgage insurers. Mortgage insurance companies also compete by providing contract underwriting services to lenders, enabling the latter to improve the efficiency of their operations by outsourcing all or part of their mortgage loan underwriting processes. As already noted, the Company ceased underwriting new mortgage guaranty insurance effective August 31, 2011. 

The Company believes its experience and expertise have enabled it to develop a variety of specialized insurance programs and related services for its customers, and to secure state insurance departments' approval of these programs. 

(f) Government Regulation. &#32;In common with all insurance companies, Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries are subject to the regulation and supervision of the jurisdictions in which they do business. The method of such regulation varies, but, generally, regulation has been delegated to state insurance commissioners who are granted broad administrative powers relating to: the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; approval of policy forms; reserve requirements; and trade practices. In addition to these types of regulation, many classes of insurance, including most of the Company's insurance coverages, are subject to rate regulations which require that rates be reasonable, adequate, and not unfairly discriminatory. 

The majority of states have also enacted insurance holding company laws which require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies controlled by other corporations licensed to transact business within their respective jurisdictions. Old Republic's insurance subsidiaries are subject to such legislation and are registered as controlled insurers in those jurisdictions in which such registration is required. Such legislation varies from state to state but typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the registered insurers, or ultimate holding company, and all subsidiaries of the ultimate holding company, and prior approval of certain intercorporate transfers of assets (including payments of dividends in excess of specified amounts by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system.
