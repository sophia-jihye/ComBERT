 Item 1. Business. 

U.S. NeuroSurgical Holdings, Inc. owns and operates, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, stereotactic radiosurgery centers, utilizing gamma knife technology, and holds other interests in radiological treatment facilities. As used herein, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term "Company", "Registrant" and "Holdings" means U.S. NeuroSurgical Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. NeuroSurgical, Inc. (&#8220;USN&#8221;), and the wholly-owned subsidiaries of USN, U.S. NeuroSurgical Physics, Inc. and USN Corona, Inc.

USN, a Delaware corporation, was formed in July 1993. Until September 1999, USN was a wholly owned subsidiary of GHS, Inc. (&#8220;GHS&#8221;). Effective September 17, 1999, GHS distributed its shares of USN to the stockholders of GHS.

On September 3, 2015, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220; Merger Agreement &#8221;), dated as of September 3, 2015, by and among USN, Holdings and U.S. NeuroSurgical Merger Sub, Inc. (&#8220; Merger Sub &#8221;), the Company adopted a new holding company organizational structure whereby USN is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. &#160; This structure did not result in any changes to the assets or operations of the Company, but management believes that it will create a more flexible framework for possible future transactions and organizational and operational adjustments. 

The holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger (the &#8220; Merger &#8221;) conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220; DGCL &#8221;), which provides for the formation of a holding company structure without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporations. Because the holding company organizational structure occurred at the parent company level, the remainder of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries, operations and customers were not be affected by this transaction.

In order to effect the Merger, USN formed Holdings as its wholly owned subsidiary and Holdings formed Merger Sub as its wholly owned subsidiary. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into USN, with USN surviving the merger and becoming a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. Immediately prior to the Merger, Holdings had no assets, liabilities or operations.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all of the outstanding capital stock of USN was converted, on a share for share basis, into capital stock of Holdings. As a result, each former stockholder of USN became the owner of an identical number of shares of capital stock of Holdings, evidencing the same proportional interests in Holdings and having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions, as those that the stockholder held in USN.

Following the Merger, Holdings&#8217; common stock continued to trade on the over-the-counter market and continued to be quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace under the same symbol, &#8220;USNU.&#8221; The conversion of shares of capital stock under the Merger Agreement occurred without an exchange of physical certificates. Accordingly, physical certificates formerly representing shares of outstanding capital stock of USN are deemed to represent the same number of shares of capital stock of Holdings.

&#160;

Pursuant to Section 251(g) of the DGCL, the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Holdings are substantially identical to those of USN prior to the date on which the Merger Agreement took effect. The authorized capital stock of Holdings, the designations, rights, powers and preferences of such capital stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof are also substantially identical to those of the capital stock of USN immediately prior to the date of the Merger. Further, the directors and executive officers of Holdings are the same individuals who were directors and executive officers, respectively, of USN immediately prior to the date of the Merger.

The Company's executive offices are located at 2400 Research Boulevard, Suite 325, Rockville, Maryland 20850, and its telephone number is (301) 208-8998.

General 

The Company and its predecessors have owned and operated stereotactic radiosurgery centers, utilizing gamma knife technology since 1993. The Company currently owns and operates one gamma knife center on the premises of New York University Medical Center (&#8220;NYU&#8221;) in New York, New York. In January 2009, the Company opened a new center, the Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center, at the San Antonio Regional Hospital (&#8220;SARH&#8221;) in Upland, California.

Management continues to explore opportunities to organize and participate in additional gamma knife centers. The Company's business strategy is to provide cost-effective approaches that allow hospitals, physicians, and patients access to gamma knife treatment capability, a high capital cost item. The Company provides the gamma knife to medical facilities on a "cost per treatment" basis. The Company&#8217;s business model is to own, or hold an interest in, the gamma knife units, and charge the medical facility, where the unit is housed and maintained, based on utilization.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, USN Corona, Inc. (&#8220;USNC&#8221;), to carry investments in Corona Gamma Knife, LLC and NeuroPartners, LLC. Those business units were formed to develop and manage the gamma knife center at SARH.

&#160;

The Company's principal target market is medical centers in major health care catchment areas that have physicians experienced with and dedicated to the use of the gamma knife. As it has with its NYU and SARH gamma knife centers, if circumstances support the opening of additional centers, the Company would seek cooperative ventures with these facilities.

In October 2012, the Company&#8217;s facility at NYU was totally destroyed as a result of flooding from Hurricane Sandy. The Company finalized arrangements with NYU regarding the restoration of the gamma knife center and the Company&#8217;s long term contract with NYU. The location of the restored center, with the new Leksell PERFEXION gamma knife, is in the Tisch Hospital of NYU Langone Medical Center. The center reopened and the first patient was treated on April, 29, 2014.

The Company estimates that, as of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 120 gamma knife treatment centers in the U.S.

During 2010, the Company expanded its market strategy to include opportunities to develop cancer centers featuring radiation therapy. These centers utilize linear accelerators with IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy) and IGRT (Image Guided Radiation Therapy) capabilities. In 2010, the Company formed Florida Oncology Partners, LLC in partnership with local physicians and other investors. USNC owns a 24% interest in the venture. The center is located in Miami, Florida and opened in the second quarter of 2011. The Company invested $200,000 in connection with its interest.

In 2011, the Company formed Boca Oncology Partners LLC, in partnership with local physicians and other investors. USNC, owned an 11.25% interest in the venture. The center, located in Boca Raton, Florida, opened in the third quarter of 2012. In February of 2014, the Company and the other partners sold their interest in Boca Oncology Partners, LLC to SFRO Holdings.

In January 2013, the Company formed Broward Oncology Partners, LLC with other outside investors to operate a radiation oncology center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. USNC owned a 12.5% interest in the venture. The center opened in February 2013. In May 2014, the Company and other members sold their interests in Broward Oncology Partners, LLC.

The Company is currently exploring other opportunities for the establishment of cancer centers using IMRT and/or IGRT in Florida and other parts of the U.S.

Gamma Knife Technology 

The gamma knife is a unique stereotactic radiosurgical device used to treat brain tumors and other malformations of the brain without invasive surgery. The gamma knife delivers a single, high dose of ionizing radiation emanating from 201 cobalt-60 sources positioned about a hemispherical, precision machined cavity. The lesion is first targeted with precision accuracy using advanced imaging and three dimensional treatment planning techniques such as CT Scans, MR Scans, conventional X-rays, or angiography. Each individual beam is focused on a common target producing an intense concentration of radiation at the target site, destroying the lesion while spreading the entry radiation dose uniformly and harmlessly over the patient's skull. The mechanical precision at the target site is +/- 0.1mm (1/10 of 1 millimeter). Because of the steep fall-off in the radiation intensity surrounding the target, the lesion can be destroyed, while sparing the surrounding tissue.

&#160;

The procedure, performed in a single treatment, sharply reduces hospital stay times and eliminates post-surgical bleeding and infection. When compared with conventional neurosurgery, gamma knife treatment is less expensive. However, not all patients are candidates for radiosurgery since the decision to use the gamma knife depends on the type, size, and location of the lesion.

Linear Accelerators 

A linear particle accelerator (LINAC) is a type of particle accelerator that greatly increases the velocity of charged subatomic particles or ions by subjecting the charged particles to a series of oscillating electric potentials along a linear beamline. LINACs accelerate electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, in which the RF (radio frequency) power creates a standing wave. Some LINACs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines tend to have a horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical LINACs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25 MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease.

The intensity of the radiation in IMRT can be changed during treatment to spare more adjoining normal tissue than is spared during conventional radiation therapy. Because of this an increased dose of radiation can be delivered to the tumor using IMRT. IMRT is a type of conformal radiation, which shapes radiation beams to closely approximate the shape of the tumor.

IGRT is used to help better deliver radiation therapy to cancerous tumors. This is very useful since tumors can move between treatments due to differences in organ filling or movements while breathing. IGRT involves conformal radiation treatment guided by specialized imaging tests, such as CT scans, ultrasound or X-rays. These tests are done in the treatment room just before the patient is to receive his or her daily radiation therapy treatment.

New York Gamma Knife Center 

The Company&#8217;s New York gamma knife treatment center was opened in July 1997 on the campus of NYU Medical Center. The Company installed a new Leksell gamma knife, the PERFEXION model, at the NYU Medical Center in March 2009 in replacement of the older gamma knife equipment. In connection with this upgrade, the Company modified its arrangement with NYU to extend the term for 12 years from March 2009.

In October 2012, the Company&#8217;s facility at NYU was totally destroyed as a result of flooding from Hurricane Sandy. The gamma knife had to be removed to prevent any cobalt leakage that might occur due to rusting of the equipment. The removal cost was $525,000. The Company paid a lease settlement of the outstanding principal balance only and received from insurance coverage $930,000 above the lease principal payments and emergency removal costs.

&#160;

The Company finalized arrangements with NYU regarding the restoration of the gamma knife center and the Company&#8217;s long term contract with NYU. The NYU facility was rebuilt and reopened in the Tisch Hospital of NYU Langone Medical Center. The first patient was treated on April, 29, 2014. The Company expects to generate revenue from the restored gamma knife center under the NYU contract until March 2021.

The Company entered into a six year lease in the amount of $4.7 million for the purchase of the replacement equipment and associated leasehold improvements. The first payment of $78,000 was made on September 1, 2014, including $18,000 of interest, and the final payment is due on May 1, 2020. The Company entered into a second two year lease in the amount of $250,000 for the cost of the construction required at the relocated site. The first payment of $12,000 was made on November 1, 2014, and the final payment is due on July 1, 2016.

The major terms of the agreement with NYU continue in effect, terminating at the end of March 2021. The Company is responsible for the maintenance and insurance for the gamma knife equipment at the NYU facility and is reimbursed for use of the gamma knife based on a fee per procedure performed with the equipment. NYU provides the medical and technical staff to operate the facility. At the end of the contract term, costs associated with closing and restoring the NYU facility to its original condition are the responsibility of the Company.

NYU pays the Company a scheduled fee based on the number of patient procedures performed. There were 474 patients treated during the year ended December 31, 2015, whereas in the prior year, while the center was only open from April to December, there were 326 patients treated at the facility. Total revenue in 2015 was $2,944,000 as opposed to total revenue of $2,607,000 in 2014.

The Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center 

During 2007, the Company managed the formation of the Southern California Regional Gamma Knife center at SARH in Upland, California. The Company participates in the ownership and operation of the center through its wholly-owned subsidiary, USNC. Corona Gamma Knife, LLC (&#8220;CGK&#8221;) is party to a 14-year agreement with SARH to renovate space in the hospital and install and operate a Leksell PERFEXION gamma knife. CGK leases the gamma knife from NeuroPartners LLC, which holds the gamma knife equipment. In addition to returns on its ownership interests, USNC expects to receive fees for management services relating to the facility.

USNC is a 20% owner of NeuroPartners LLC and owns 39% of CGK.

USNC is a 20% guarantor on NeuroPartners, LLC&#8217;s seven-year lease with respect to the gamma knife equipment and certain leasehold improvements at SARH. The outstanding balance on the lease obligations was $970,000 at December 31, 2015. In February 2016, NeuroPartners, negotiated a new lease to fund the reloading of cobalt and the necessary construction to do so. The new lease of $1,663,000 includes the balance of the lease obligations. This loan will be paid over 60 months. The first payment is due on April 1, 2016.

&#160;

The Company expects any potential obligations from this guarantee would be reduced by the recovery of the related collateral and expects any amounts arising from this guarantee to be insignificant.

Construction of the SARH gamma knife center was completed in December 2008 and the first patient was treated in January 2009. The project has been funded principally by outside investors. While the Company has led the effort in organizing the business and overseeing the development and operation of the SARH center, its investment to date in the SARH center has been minimal.

The Company&#8217;s share of cumulative losses associated with its investment in NeuroPartners LLC and CGK has exceeded its investment. Due to the outstanding loans made to NeuroPartners, LLC and CGK, NeuroPartners, LLC and CGK are considered to be variable interest entities of the Company. However, as the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of NeuroPartners, LLC and CGK, since it does not have the power to direct the operating activities that most significantly affect NeuroPartners, LLC&#8217;s and CGK&#8217;s economic performance, certain disclosures are required rather than consolidation.

During 2015 the Company absorbed losses against the total outstanding receivables of $62,000 from NeuroPartners LLC and CGK. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s equity in loss of NeuroPartners, LLC and CGK was $84,000. The Company&#8217;s portion of the total accumulated deficit is $412,000.

Future Gamma Knife Centers 

The Company is currently exploring other opportunities for gamma knife centers and centers that provide related healthcare services located near hospitals throughout the United States. Discussions regarding such centers is preliminary and there can be no assurance that any such discussions will result in the opening of new centers.

Florida Oncology Partners 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, the Company participated in the formation of Florida Oncology Partners, LLC (&#8220;FOP&#8221;) and Florida Oncology Partners RE, LLC (&#8220;FOPRE&#8221;) (collectively referred to as &#8220;Florida Oncology Partners&#8221;), which operates a cancer center located in West Kendall (Miami), Florida. The center diagnoses and treats patients utilizing a Varian Rapid Arc linear accelerator and a GE CT scanner. USNC originally invested $200,000 for a 20% interest in Florida Oncology Partners. The remaining 80% was owned by other outside investors. The center opened and treated its first patient in May 2011. During 2012 and 2013, FOP made several distributions that reduced the Company&#8217;s investment significantly. In January of 2015, one of the investors was removed from the entities, and his ownership interest was distributed among the remaining members in relationship to the percentage they owned. This distribution resulted in an increase of ownership interest for the Company of 4% in each entity. As of January 1, 2015, the Company has a 24% ownership in both FOP and FOPRE. 

During 2011, FOP entered into a seven year capital lease with Key Bank for approximately $5,800,000. Under the terms of the capital lease, USNC agreed to guarantee a maximum of $1,433,000, approximately 25% of the original lease obligation in the event of default. In June 2012, FOPRE completed the financing agreement to purchase the building that is occupied by FOP. The amount of the loan was $1,534,000 to be paid at a monthly rate of approximately $8,500 for 120 months with the final payment due on June 15, 2022. In December 2015, FOPRE sold the building, for a gain on sale of $577,000. The Company&#8217;s share of the gain was $139,000. The related mortgage was repaid upon closing of the sale.

&#160;

In December of 2015, FOP entered into an agreement with 21 st Century Oncology for the purchase of FOP&#8217;s Varian machine and other medical equipment. 21 st Century Oncology paid FOP $1,000,000 as a down payment for the machine and other medical equipment and is currently making monthly payments of $171,000 for the machine until such time as the sale is finalized.

Boca Oncology Partners 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2011, the Company participated in the formation of Boca Oncology Partners, LLC (&#8220;BOP&#8221;), for the purpose of owning and operating a cancer center in Boca Raton, Florida. In June 2011, Boca Oncology Partners RE, LLC (&#8220;BOPRE&#8221;), an affiliated entity, purchased a 20% interest in Boca West IMP, LLC (&#8220;Boca West IMP&#8221;), owner of a medical office building in West Boca, Florida in which BOP operates. BOP occupies approximately 6,000 square feet of the 32,000 square foot building. The Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, USNC, invested $225,000 initially and had a 22.5% interest in BOP and BOPRE.

In January 2012, an additional investor purchased 50% of the partnership reducing the Company&#8217;s ownership to 11.25%. The Company loaned the proceeds of $56,250 back to BOP as a 5 year note at 7% interest. The remaining 88.75% was owned by other outside investors. In June 2012, BOPRE purchased an additional 3.75% of Boca West IMP from another investor, bringing its total interest to 23.75%. BOPRE accounts for this investment under the cost method since it does not exercise significant influence over Boca West IMP. Then the members of BOPRE sold 31.5% of BOPRE to a new investor. The proceeds of $28,000 were loaned to BOP and USNC&#8217;s investment in BOPRE was reduced to 15.4%.

Although the Company reduced its investment to 11.25% of BOP and 15.4% of BOPRE, the Company continues to account for these investments under the equity method due to its participation in the management of the administration and accounting functions of BOP and BOPRE. Due to the outstanding loans made to BOP, BOP was considered to be a variable interest entity of the Company. However, as the Company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of BOP, since it did not have the power to direct the operating activities that most significantly affect BOP&#8217;s economic performance; certain disclosures are required rather than consolidation.

The center opened and the first patient was treated in August 2012. In February 2014, the Company and other members sold their interests in BOP. Three members provided short-term loans to the Company of $462,000 from their sales proceeds. During 2014, the Company had incurred $26,000 in interest expense related to these loans. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company repaid all of the loan balance and associated interest.

The Company&#8217;s recorded investment in BOPRE is $139,000 at December 31, 2015.

USNC is a 10% guarantor on 50% of the outstanding balance of Boca West IMP&#8217;s ten-year mortgage. This mortgage had an original balance of $3,000,000 and is secured by the medical office building in which BOP operates. The outstanding balance on the mortgage is $2,632,000 at December 31, 2015. The Company expects any potential obligations from this guarantee would be fully satisfied out of the proceeds of the liquidation of the real estate and thus believes that as a practical matter its exposure in connections with the guarantee is not material.

&#160;

USNC was a 14.06% guarantor on BOP&#8217;s five-year lease with respect to the oncology equipment at the Boca Raton, Florida cancer center. Upon the sale of BOP, which occurred in 2014, USNC was indemnified by the buyer from any losses arising from the guarantee.

Broward Oncology Partners 

In January 2013, the Company formed Broward Oncology Partners, LLC (&#8220;BROP&#8221;) with other outside investors. The Company invested $50,000 in late April 2013 for a 12.5% ownership interest in BROP. BROP operates a radiation oncology center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida under a lease from Tenet Health Services. BROP began operations in February 2013.

In May 2014, the Company and other members sold their interests in BROP.

Strategy for Participation in Cancer Treatment 

As a result of the Company&#8217;s experiences over the past few years, the Company has expanded its focus to the broader based cancer treatment market. In order to reduce the risk and broaden its opportunities for profitable growth, the Company, where possible, has been pursuing partnerships with local investors/providers to develop and operate oncology centers that utilize linear accelerators (LINACs) to treat cancers in the whole body. The Company also continues to evaluate opportunities to develop additional gamma knife facilities. FOP, BOP and the Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center typify this new strategy.
