 Item 1. Business Cross Timbers Royalty Trust is an express trust created under the laws of Texas pursuant to the Cross Timbers Royalty Trust Indenture entered into on February 12, 1991 between predecessors of XTO Energy Inc. (formerly known as Cross Timbers Oil Company), as grantors, and NCNB Texas National Bank, as trustee. Southwest Bank is now the trustee of the Trust. The principal office of the Trust is located at 2911 Turtle Creek Blvd, Suite 850, Dallas, Texas 75219 (telephone number 855-588-7839). 

On January 9, 2014, U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management, a division of Bank of America, N.A., gave notice to unitholders that it would resign as trustee. At the special meeting of the Trust&#146;s unitholders held on June 20, 2014, the unitholders of the Trust voted to approve the proposal to appoint Southwest Bank as successor trustee of the Trust effective August 29, 2014.

On February 12, 1991, the predecessors of XTO Energy conveyed defined net profits interests to the Trust under five separate conveyances: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; one in each of the states of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, to convey a 90% defined net profits interest carved out of substantially all royalty and overriding royalty interests owned by the predecessors in those states, and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; one in each of the states of Texas and Oklahoma, to convey a 75% defined net profits interest carved out of specific working interests owned by the predecessors in those states. The conveyance of these net profits interests was effective for production from October 1, 1990. The net profits interests and the underlying properties are further described under Item 2, Properties. 

In exchange for the net profits interests conveyed to the Trust, the predecessors of XTO Energy received 6,000,000 units of beneficial interest of the Trust. Predecessors of XTO Energy distributed units to their owners in February 1991 and November 1992, and in February 1992, sold units in the Trust&#146;s initial public offering. Units are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#147;CRT.&#148; XTO Energy currently is not a unitholder of the Trust. 

On June 25, 2010, XTO Energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation. 

Under the terms of each of the five conveyances, the Trust receives net profits income from the net profits interests generally on the last business day of each month. Net profits income is determined by XTO Energy by multiplying the net profit percentage (90% or 75%) times net proceeds from the underlying properties for each conveyance during the previous month. Net proceeds are the gross proceeds received from the sale of production, less &#147;production costs,&#148; as defined in the conveyances. For the 90% net profits interests and the 75% net profits interests, production costs generally include applicable property taxes, transportation, marketing and other charges. For the 75% net profits interests only, production costs also include capital and operating costs paid (e.g., drilling, production and other direct costs of owning and operating the property) and a monthly overhead charge that is adjusted annually. The monthly overhead charge at December 31, 2015 was $38,430 ($28,823 net to the Trust). XTO Energy deducts an overhead charge as operator of the Hewitt Unit. As of December 31, 2015, monthly overhead attributable to the Hewitt Unit was $5,490 ($4,118 net to the Trust). If production costs exceed gross proceeds for any conveyance, this excess is carried forward to future monthly computations of net proceeds until the excess costs (plus interest accrued as specified in the conveyances) are completely recovered. Excess production costs and related accrued interest from one conveyance cannot be used to reduce net proceeds from any other conveyance. 

&#160;

Costs exceeded revenues on properties underlying the Texas working interest in January 2015 through July 2015, September 2015 through December 2015, January 2014, November 2014, January 2013, March 2013 and April 2013, and on properties underlying the Oklahoma working interest in March 2015 through July 2015, September 2015 through December 2015 and June 2014. Remaining cumulative excess costs totaled $2,026,071 ($1,519,553 net to the Trust) for the period ended December 31, 2015. For further information on excess costs, see Trustee&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under Item 7. 

The Trust is not liable for any production costs or liabilities attributable to the underlying properties. If at any time the Trust receives net profits income in excess of the amount due, the Trust is not obligated to return the overpayment, but net profits income payable to the Trust for the next month will be reduced by the overpayment, plus interest at the prime rate. 

Approximately 20 of the underlying royalty interests in the San Juan Basin burden working interests in properties operated by XTO Energy. XTO Energy operates the Hewitt Unit which is one of the properties underlying the Oklahoma 75% net profits interests. Other than these properties, XTO Energy and ExxonMobil do not operate or control any of the underlying properties or related working interests. 

As a working interest owner, XTO Energy can generally decline participation in any operation and allow consenting parties to conduct such operations, as provided under the operating agreements. XTO Energy also can assign, sell, or otherwise transfer its interest in the underlying properties, subject to the net profits interests, or can abandon an underlying property that is a working interest if it is incapable of producing in paying quantities, as determined by XTO Energy. 

To the extent allowed, XTO Energy is responsible for marketing its production from the underlying properties under existing sales contracts or new arrangements on the best terms reasonably obtainable in the circumstances. 

Net profits income received by the Trust on or before the last business day of the month is generally attributable to oil production two months prior and gas production three months prior. The monthly distribution amount to unitholders is determined by: 

Adding &#150; 

&#160;

&#160; (1) net profits income received, &#160; (2) estimated interest income to be received on the monthly distribution amount, including an adjustment for the difference between the estimated and actual interest received for the prior monthly distribution amount, &#160; (3) cash available as a result of reduction of cash reserves, and &#160; (4) other cash receipts, then Subtracting &#150; 

&#160;

&#160; (1) liabilities paid and &#160; (2) the reduction in cash available due to establishment of or increase in any cash reserve. The monthly distribution amount is distributed to unitholders of record within ten business days after the monthly record date. The monthly record date is generally the last business day of the month. The trustee calculates the monthly distribution amount and announces the distribution per unit at least ten days prior to the monthly record date. 

The trustee may establish cash reserves for contingencies. Cash held for such reserves, as well as for pending payment of the monthly distribution amount, may be invested in federal obligations or certificates of deposit of major banks. 

The trustee&#146;s function is to collect the net profits income from the net profits interests, to pay all trust expenses and pay the monthly distribution amount to unitholders. The trustee&#146;s powers are specified by the terms of the indenture. The Trust cannot engage in any business activity or acquire any assets other than the net profits interests and specific short-term cash investments. The Trust has no employees since all administrative functions are performed by the trustee. 

Approximately 56% of the net profits income received by the Trust during 2015, as well as 66% of the estimated proved reserves of the net profits interests at December 31, 2015 (based on estimated future net cash flows using 12-

&#160;

month average oil and gas prices, based on the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period), is attributable to natural gas. There is generally a greater demand for gas during the winter. Otherwise, trust income is not subject to seasonal factors, nor dependent upon patents, licenses, franchises or concessions. The Trust conducts no research activities. 

The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all its phases. Operators of the properties in which the Trust holds interests encounter competition from other oil and gas companies and from individual producers and operators. Oil and natural gas are commodities, for which market prices are determined by external supply and demand factors. 

The oil and gas industry has been challenged throughout 2015 with abundance of crude oil and natural gas supplies causing commodity prices to decrease. However, current market conditions are not necessarily indicative of future conditions.
