 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Description of Business and Industry 

&#160; 

The principal business of Superior Industries International, Inc. (referred to herein as the &#8220;company&#8221; or in the first person notation &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) is the design and manufacture of aluminum wheels for sale to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). We are one of the largest suppliers of cast aluminum wheels to the world's leading automobile and light truck manufacturers, with wheel manufacturing operations in the United States and Mexico. Products made in our North American facilities are delivered primarily to automotive assembly operations in North America for global OEMs. Our OEM aluminum wheels primarily are sold for factory installation, as either optional or standard equipment, on many vehicle models manufactured by BMW, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. ("FCA"), Ford, General Motors ("GM"), Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen. 

We have gone through a transformation over the last several years as we have shifted our manufacturing base from higher cost to lower cost sources. With the diversification and increased demands for more customized premium wheels, we have made investments in engineering and design. With these investments, we are enhancing our capabilities to become a leader in premium wheels. We have doubled the wheel finishes that we offer in the last couple of years and we have developed patents, which is all part of our strategic evolution to become a competitive full line manufacturer of aluminum wheels. Another part of our evolution was to move our corporate office to Southfield, Michigan to be closer to many of our customers so we can further strengthen relationships and partner with them to design world class products. We have made significant strides with our customers over the last year as evidenced by receiving the 2015 supplier of the year award from GM. With the addition of our new facility in Mexico we have expanded our manufacturing capacity to allow for growth in the next couple of years. We continue to explore and implement operating improvements to further expand manufacturing capacity with relatively low capital investment. We are also investigating acquisition opportunities to further enhance the value and drive the growth of our business. The charts below show our major customers and our manufacturing capacity by headcount split between lower cost and higher cost sourced labor. 

&#32; 

&#160; 

Our industry is mainly driven by production levels in North America and to a much lesser extent in South America. The North American production level, in 2015, was 17.4 million vehicles, a 3 percent, or 0.5 million unit, increase over 2014. We track annual production rates based on information from Ward's Automotive Group . The North American annual production levels of automobiles and light-duty trucks (including SUV's, vans and "crossover vehicles") continue the trend of growth since the 2009 recession. Current economic conditions, low consumer interest rates and relatively inexpensive gas prices have been generally supportive of market growth and, in addition, the relatively high average age of vehicles on the road appears to be contributing to higher rates of vehicle replacement. It was reported in 2015 that the average age of all light vehicles in the U.S. increased to an all-time high of 11.5 years, according to IHS Automotive. 

In 2014, production of automobiles and light-duty trucks in North America reached 16.9 million units, an increase of 5 percent over 2013. Production in 2013 reached 16.1 million units, an increase of 0.7 million, or 5 percent, from 15.4 million vehicles in 2012. 

&#32;1 

We were initially incorporated in Delaware in 1969 and reincorporated in California in 1994. In 2015, we moved our headquarters from Van Nuys, California to Southfield, Michigan and reincorporated in Delaware in 2015. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SUP." 

Raw Materials 

The raw materials used in manufacturing our products are readily available and are obtained through numerous suppliers with whom we have established trade relations. We purchase aluminum for the manufacture of our aluminum wheels, which accounted for the vast majority of our total raw material requirements during 2015. The majority of our aluminum requirements are met through purchase orders with certain major producers, with physical supply coming from North American locations. Generally, the orders are fixed as to minimum and maximum quantities of aluminum, which the producers must supply during the term of the orders. During 2015, we were able to successfully secure aluminum commitments from our primary suppliers to meet production requirements and we anticipate being able to source aluminum requirements to meet our expected level of production in 2016. We procure other raw materials through numerous suppliers with whom we have established trade relationships. 

When market conditions warrant, we also may enter into purchase commitments to secure the supply of certain commodities used in the manufacture of our products, such as aluminum, natural gas and other raw materials. We had purchase commitments for the delivery of natural gas through the end of 2015. These natural gas contracts were considered to be derivatives under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and when entering into these contracts, it was expected that we would take full delivery of the contracted quantities of natural gas over the normal course of business. Accordingly, at inception, these contracts qualified for the normal purchase, normal sale ("NPNS") exemption provided under U.S. GAAP. 

&#160; 

Customer Dependence 

&#160; 

We have proven our ability to be a consistent producer of high quality aluminum wheels with the capability to meet our customers' price, quality, delivery and service requirements. We strive to continually enhance our relationships with our customers through continuous improvement programs, not only through our manufacturing operations but in the engineering, design, development and quality areas as well. These key business relationships have resulted in multiple vehicle supply contract awards with our key customers over the past year. 

Ford, GM, Toyota and FCA were our only customers individually accounting for more than 10 percent of our consolidated trade sales. Net sales to these customers in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (dollars in millions):

The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to Ford, GM, Toyota or FCA &#32; would have a significant adverse effect on our financial results. See also Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report. 

Foreign Operations 

We manufacture a significant portion of our products in Mexico that are sold both in the United States and Mexico. Net sales of wheels manufactured in our Mexico operations in 2015 totaled $550.7 million and represented 76 percent of our total net sales. The portion of our products produced in Mexico versus the United States will increase in 2016, as we expect to achieve full commercial production at a new wheel plant in Mexico for most of 2016. Net property, plant and equipment used in our operations in Mexico totaled $190.4 at December 31, 2015, including $112.2 million related to our recently completed wheel plant. The overall cost for us to manufacture wheels in Mexico currently is lower than the cost to manufacture wheels in the U.S., in particular, because of reduced labor cost due to lower prevailing wage rates. Such current advantages to manufacturing our product in Mexico can be affected by changes in cost structures, trade protection laws, policies and other regulations affecting trade and investments, social, political, labor, or general economic conditions in Mexico. Other factors that can affect the business and financial results of our Mexican operations include, but are not limited to, valuation of the peso, availability and competency of personnel and tax

regulations in Mexico. See also Item 1A- Risk Factors - International Operations and Item 1A - Risk Factors - Foreign Currency Fluctuations. 

Net Sales Backlog 

We receive OEM purchase orders to produce aluminum wheels typically for multiple model years. These purchase orders are typically for one year for vehicle wheel programs that usually last three to five years. We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary in part due to changes in demand, industry and/or customer maintenance cycles, new program introductions or dealer inventory levels. Accordingly, even though customer purchase orders cover multiple model years, our management does not believe that our firm backlog is a meaningful indicator of future operating results. 

&#160; 

Competition 

Competition in the market for aluminum wheels is based primarily on price, technology, quality, delivery and overall customer service. We are one of the leading suppliers of aluminum wheels for OEM installations in the world, and are the largest producer in North America. We currently supply approximately 20 percent of the aluminum wheels installed on passenger cars and light-duty trucks in North America. Competition is global in nature with growing exports from Asia into North America. There are several competitors with facilities in North America but we have more than twice the North American production capacity of any competitor based on our current estimation. See also Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report. Other types of road wheels, such as those made of steel, also compete with our products. According to Ward's Automotive Group, &#32;the aluminum wheel penetration rate on passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S. was 79 percent for the 2015 model year and 81 percent for the 2014 model year, compared to 80 percent for the 2013 model year. We expect the ratio of aluminum to steel wheels to remain relatively stable. However, several factors can affect this rate including price, fuel economy requirements and styling preference. Although aluminum wheels currently are more costly than steel, aluminum is a lighter material than steel, which is desirable for fuel efficiency and generally viewed as aesthetically superior to steel, and thus more desirable to the OEMs and their customers. 

Research and Development 

Our policy is to continuously review, improve and develop our engineering capabilities to satisfy our customer requirements in the most efficient and cost effective manner available. We strive to achieve this objective by attracting and retaining top engineering talent and by maintaining the latest state-of-the-art computer technology to support engineering development. A fully staffed engineering center, located in Fayetteville, Arkansas, supports our research and development manufacturing needs. We also have a technical sales center at our corporate headquarters in Southfield, Michigan that maintains a complement of engineering staff centrally located near some of our largest customers' headquarters and engineering and purchasing offices. 

Research and development costs (primarily engineering and related costs), which are expensed as incurred, are included in cost of sales in our consolidated income statements. Amounts expended on research and development costs during each of the last three years were $2.6 million in 2015; $4.4 million in 2014; and $4.8 million in 2013. 

Government Regulation 

Safety standards in the manufacture of vehicles and automotive equipment have been established under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal standards currently applicable to OEM suppliers and to automotive manufacturers. 

Environmental Compliance 

Our manufacturing facilities, like most other manufacturing companies, are subject to solid waste, water and air pollution control standards mandated by federal, state and local laws. Violators of these laws are subject to fines and, in extreme cases, plant closure. We believe our facilities are in material compliance with all presently applicable standards. However, costs related to environmental protection may grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations. The cost of environmental compliance was approximately $0.7 million in 2015; $0.4 million in 2014; and $0.5 million in 2013. We expect that future environmental compliance expenditures will approximate these levels and will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position. Furthermore, climate change legislation or regulations restricting emission of "greenhouse gases" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the vehicles that use our products. See also Item 1A - Risk Factors - Environmental Matters of this Annual Report.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 3,050 full-time employees compared to approximately 3,000 employees at December 31, 2014. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 

Fiscal Year End 

Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending generally on the last Sunday of the calendar year. The fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 comprised the 52-week periods ended on December 27, 2015, December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, respectively. For convenience of presentation, all fiscal years are referred to as beginning as of January 1, and ending as of December 31, but actually reflect our financial position and results of operations for the periods described above. 

Segment Information 

We operate as a single integrated business and, as such, have only one operating segment - automotive wheels. Financial information about this segment and geographic areas is contained in Note 5 - Business Segments in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. 

Seasonal Variations 

The automotive industry is cyclical and varies based on the timing of consumer purchases of vehicles, which in turn vary based on a variety of factors such as general economic conditions, availability of consumer credit, interest rates and fuel costs. While there have been no significant seasonal variations in the past few years, production schedules in our industry can vary significantly from quarter to quarter to meet the scheduling demands of our customers.
