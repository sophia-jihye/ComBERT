The Corporation&#8217;s principal office is located in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania. The largest subsidiary is Citizens &#38; Northern Bank (&#8220;C&#38;N Bank&#8221; or the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Corporation&#8217;s other wholly-owned subsidiaries are Citizens &#38; Northern Investment Corporation and Bucktail Life Insurance Company (&#8220;Bucktail&#8221;). Citizens &#38; Northern Investment Corporation was formed in 1999 to engage in investment activities. Bucktail reinsures credit and mortgage life and accident and health insurance on behalf of C&#38;N Bank.

&#160;

C&#38;N Bank is a Pennsylvania banking institution that was formed by the consolidation of Northern National Bank of Wellsboro and Citizens National Bank of Towanda on October 1, 1971. Subsequent mergers included: First National Bank of Ralston in May 1972; Sullivan County National Bank in October 1977; Farmers National Bank of Athens in January 1984; and First National Bank of East Smithfield in May 1990. In 2005, the Corporation acquired Canisteo Valley Corporation and its subsidiary, First State Bank, a New York State chartered commercial bank with offices in Canisteo and South Hornell, NY. In 2010, the First State Bank operations were merged into C&#38;N Bank and Canisteo Valley Corporation was merged into the Corporation. On May 1, 2007, the Corporation acquired Citizens Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;), with banking offices in Coudersport, Emporium and Port Allegany, Pennsylvania. Citizens Trust Company, the banking subsidiary of Citizens, was merged with and into C&#38;N Bank as part of the transaction. C&#38;N Bank has held its current name since May 6, 1975, at which time C&#38;N Bank changed its charter from a national bank to a Pennsylvania bank.

&#160;

C&#38;N Bank provides an extensive range of banking services, including deposit and loan products for personal and commercial customers. The Bank also maintains a trust division that provides a wide range of financial services, such as 401(k) plans, retirement planning, estate planning, estate settlements and asset management. In January 2000, C&#38;N Bank formed a subsidiary, C&#38;N Financial Services Corporation (&#8220;C&#38;NFSC&#8221;). C&#38;NFSC is a licensed insurance agency that provides insurance products to individuals and businesses. In 2001, C&#38;NFSC added a broker-dealer division, which offers mutual funds, annuities, educational savings accounts and other investment products through registered agents. C&#38;NFSC&#8217;s operations are not significant in relation to the total operations of the Corporation.

&#160;

All phases of the Bank&#8217;s business are competitive. The Bank primarily competes in Tioga, Bradford, Sullivan, Lycoming, Potter, Cameron and McKean counties in Pennsylvania, and Steuben and Allegany counties in New York. The Bank competes with local commercial banks headquartered in our market area as well as other commercial banks with branches in our market area. Some of the banks that have branches in our market area are larger in overall size. With respect to lending activities and attracting deposits, the Bank also competes with savings banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, regulated small loan companies and credit unions. Also, the Bank competes with mutual funds for deposits. C&#38;N Bank competes with insurance companies, investment counseling firms, mutual funds and other business firms and individuals for trust, investment management, brokerage and insurance services. The Bank is generally competitive with all financial institutions in our service area with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans. The Bank serves a diverse customer base, and is not economically dependent on any small group of customers or on any individual industry.

&#160;

Major initiatives within the last 5 years included the following:

&#160;

&#183; in 2011, sold the banking facility at 130 Court Street, Williamsport, PA, and entered into a leasing arrangement to continue to offer banking and trust services from the facility, resulting in an estimated $122,000 (pre-tax) reduction in operating expenses in 2012; &#160;

&#183; in April 2012, re-opened the Athens, PA, facility, which was damaged by flooding in September 2011; &#160;

&#183; in 2013, worked with consultants on projects which resulted in increases in revenues from service charges on deposit accounts, starting primarily in the fourth quarter 2013, and reductions in electronic funds processing expenses and other benefits over approximately the next five years; &#160;

&#183; in 2014, approved a new treasury stock repurchase program. Under the new program, the Corporation is authorized to repurchase up to 622,500 shares of the Corporation&#8217;s common stock, or approximately 5% of the Corporation&#8217;s outstanding shares at July 16, 2014. Cumulatively through December 31, 2015, 435,200 shares had been repurchased; and &#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; in 2015, began an organization-wide effort to enhance customer relationships, growth and profitability, including working with consultants on enhanced employee engagement and customer service training, and hiring four new lending personnel to provide more access to commercial and mortgage lending opportunities. &#160;

Virtually all of the Corporation&#8217;s banking offices are located in the &#8220;Marcellus Shale,&#8221; an area extending across portions of New York State, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia. In recent years, most of the Pennsylvania counties in which the Corporation operates were significantly affected by an upsurge in natural gas exploration, as technological developments made exploration of the Marcellus Shale commercially feasible. After a surge of activity in 2009 through most of 2011, the market price of natural gas declined, causing Marcellus Shale natural gas exploration activity to slow, though some activity has continued to occur throughout the Corporation&#8217;s market area. Through December 31, 2015, the Corporation has not experienced significant credit issues as a result of the expansion and subsequent reduction in Marcellus Shale-related activity.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, C&#38;N Bank had total assets of $1,209,389,000, total deposits of $942,331,000, net loans outstanding of $696,991,000 and 283 full-time equivalent employees.

&#160;
