 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

History 

General Cannabis Corp was incorporated on June 3, 2013. Promap Corporation (&#147;Promap&#148;), our predecessor company, was incorporated in the State of Colorado on November 12, 1987. Promap originally operated as an independent geographic information system (&#147;GIS&#148;) and custom draft energy mapping company providing hard copy and digital format oil and gas production maps for the oil and gas industry in the United States and Canada. Prior to December 2013, most of our sales were to a company controlled by our former Chief Executive Officer. On December 31, 2013, we sold our oil and gas mapping business to our former Chief Executive Officer in consideration for his agreement to assume all liabilities associated with the mapping business.

On August 14, 2013, Promap acquired 94% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. (&#147;ACSI&#148;), a private Colorado Corporation, in exchange for 12,400,000 shares of its common stock (the &#147;Share Exchange Agreement&#148;). On November 9, 2013, we acquired the remaining 6% of the share capital of ACSI. On October 1, 2013, we changed our name from Promap Corporation to Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. On June 17, 2015, we changed our name from Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. to General Cannabis Corp. We completed a change in trading symbol to CANN (OTCQB).

Subsidiary Structure 

We have five wholly-owned subsidiaries:, (a) ACS Colorado Corp., a Colorado corporation formed in 2013; (b) Advanced Cannabis Solutions Corporation, a Colorado corporation formed in 2013; (c) 6565 E. Evans Owner LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2014; (d) General Cannabis Capital Corporation, a Colorado corporation formed in 2015; and (e) GC Security LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2015. Advanced Cannabis Solutions Corporation has one wholly-owned subsidiary company, ACS Corp., which was formed in Colorado on June 6, 2013.

Our Products, Services and Customers 

We operate in a rapidly evolving and highly regulated industry that, as has been estimated by some, will exceed $30 billion by the year 2020. We have been and will continue to be aggressive in executing acquisitions and other opportunities that we believe will benefit us in the long-term.

Through our reporting segments (Finance and Real Estate, Wholesale Supply, Security, and Consulting) we provide products and services to the regulated cannabis industry, which include the following:

Security and Cash Management Services 

In March 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Iron Protection Group, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, and will continue to do business as &#147;Iron Protection Group.&#148; Iron Protection Group provides advanced security, including on-site professionals, video surveillance and cash transport, to licensed cannabis cultivators and retail shops. As of December 31, 2015, Iron Protection Group has approximately 80 guards who serve 14 clients throughout Colorado.

Marketing and Products 

In September 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Chiefton Supply Co., and established a dba of Chiefton Supply Co., incorporated in Colorado (&#147;Chiefton&#148;). Chiefton is an apparel and design company. We design, distribute and sell apparel featuring graphic designs. Our apparel is purchased and screen printed by third parties, for which there are numerous suppliers. Chiefton also provides high-level design and branding services to various clients, from grow stores and dispensaries to wholesale cannabis companies. Chiefton has built a name for themselves through innovative cannabis graphic design and branding. Initially focusing on the development of their apparel line, they realized the opportunity to provide similar services to fellow organizations within the industry.

Our wholesale supply business, GC Supply, is a reseller of supplies to the cannabis market. GC Supply works with industry leaders and innovators to deliver high-quality products that are compliant with applicable regulations and with a focus on products that are manufactured in the United States. GC Supply operates out of a leased, 1,800 square-foot warehouse located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Consulting and Advisory 

Through Next Big Crop we deliver comprehensive consulting services to the cannabis industry that include obtaining licenses, compliance, cultivation, logistical support, facility design and building services. Our business plan is based on the future growth of the regulated cannabis market in the United States. We will provide general advisory services for business development, facilities design and construction, cultivation and retail operations, marketing and the improvement and expansion of existing operations.

Finance and Real Estate 

Real Estate Leasing 

Our real estate leasing business primarily includes the acquisition and leasing of cultivation space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations. Management anticipates that these facilities will range in size from 5,000 to 50,000 square feet. These facilities will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate cultivation facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate our tenants&#146; compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

As of the date of this report, we owned one cultivation property that is located in a suburb of Pueblo, Colorado (the &#147;Pueblo West Property&#148;). The property consists of approximately three acres of land, which currently includes a 5,000 square foot steel building, and parking lot. The property is zoned for cultivating cannabis and is leased to a medical cannabis grower until December 31, 2022. We are evaluating strategic options for this property.

Shared Office Space, Networking and Event Services 

In October 2014, we purchased a former retail bank located at 6565 East Evans Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80224, which has been branded as The Greenhouse (&#147;The Greenhouse&#148;). The building is a 16,056 square-foot facility, which will be converted to serve as the largest shared workspace for entrepreneurs, professionals and others serving the cannabis industry. Clients will be able to lease space to use as offices, meeting rooms, lecture, educational and networking facilities, and individual workstations.

The Greenhouse has approximately 10,000 square feet of existing office space and 5,000 square feet on its ground floor that is dedicated to a consumer banking design. The banking space includes a vault with safety deposit boxes, three drive through teller windows and five secure teller windows inside.

We plan to continue to acquire commercial real estate and lease office space to participants in the cannabis industry. These participants include media, internet, packaging, lighting, cultivation supplies, and financial services. In exchange for certain services that may be provided to these tenants, we expect to receive rental income in the form of cash. In certain cases, we may acquire equity interests or provide debt capital to these businesses.

Industry Finance and Equipment Leasing Services 

We lease cultivation equipment and facilities to customers in the cannabis industry. We expect we will enter into sale lease-back transactions of grow lights, tenant improvements and other grow equipment. Since Colorado State law does not allow entities operating under a cannabis license to pledge the assets or the license of the cannabis operation for any type of general borrowing activity, we intend to provide loans to individuals and businesses in the cannabis industry on an unsecured basis. Equipment will only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate such facilities. The leases with the tenants will provide certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate its tenants&#146; compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

We are exploring lending opportunities in Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Arizona. Our finance strategy will include making direct term loans and providing revolving lines of credit to businesses involved in the cultivation and sale of cannabis and related products. These loans will generally be secured to the maximum extent permitted by law. We believe there is a significant demand for this financing. We are pursuing other finance services including customized finance, capital formation, and banking, for participants in the cannabis industry.

On November 4, 2015, we entered into an agreement (the &#147;DB Option Agreement&#148;) with Infinity Capital, a related party. Pursuant to the DB Option Agreement, Infinity Capital granted us a six month option to purchase all of its interest in DB Products Arizona, LLC (&#147;DB&#148;) at Infinity Capital&#146;s actual cost, plus $1.00, or $600,001. The interests for which the option has been granted are Infinity Capital&#146;s 50% equity interest in the membership interests of DB, and any outstanding unpaid principal and interest owed on promissory note(s) issued by DB in favor of Infinity Capital for up to $600,000. DB is involved in the production and distribution of Dixie Brands, Inc&#146;s full line of medical cannabis Dixie Elixirs and Edible products in Arizona. DB expects to begin sales in 2016. We have no obligation to exercise the option.

Competitive Strengths 

We believe we possess certain competitive strengths and advantages in the industries which we operate:

Range of Services: We are able to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver a comprehensive, integrated solution to companies in the cannabis industry &#150; from operational and compliance consulting to security and marketing to financing needs.

Strategic Alliances. We are dedicated to rapid growth through acquisitions, partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy in pursuing these alliances are based on the target&#146;s ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs, and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. We anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis.

Industry&#146;s Access to Capital. In February 2014, the Treasury Department issued guidelines for financial institutions dealing with cannabis-related businesses, (see &#147;FinCEN&#148; under &#147;Federal Regulations and Our Business&#148; of this document). In March 2015, legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate proposing to change federal law such that states could regulate medical use of cannabis without risk of federal prosecution. A key component of the proposed Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the &#147;CARERS Act&#148;) is to reclassify cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act to Schedule II, thereby changing the plant from a federally-criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. Many banks and traditional financial institutions refuse to provide financial services to cannabis-related business. We plan to provide finance and leasing solutions to market participants using the FinCEN guidelines as a primary guide for compliance with federal law.

Regulatory Compliance. The state laws regulating the cannabis industry are changing at a rapid pace. Currently, there are twenty-three U.S. states and the District of Columbia that have created a legislative body to manage the medical cannabis industry. There are also four states that have allowed recreational use. In Colorado and Washington states, cannabis is heavily regulated. It is a critical component of our business plan both to ensure that all aspects of our operations are in compliance with all laws, policies, guidance and regulations to which we are subject and to provide an opportunity to our customers and allies to use our services to ensure that they, too, are in full compliance.

Industry Breadth. We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value. Our management team has extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We work with partners who enhance our industry breadth.

Market Conditions 

In Colorado, the cannabis market was expanded in January 2014 to permit &#147;recreational use&#148;. Generally, this means adults over the age of twenty-one, including visitors from other states, can purchase cannabis from licensed retailers, subject to certain daily limits. Voters in the states of Washington, Oregon and Alaska have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use.

According to the Colorado Department of Revenue, Colorado&#146;s cannabis industry reported the following estimated monthly cannabis sales during 2015:

Competition 

Currently, there are a number of other companies that provide similar products and/or services, such as direct finance, leasing of real estate, including shared workspace, warehouse sales, and consulting services to the cannabis industry. In the future we fully expect that other companies will recognize the value of ancillary businesses serving the cannabis industry and enter into the marketplace as competitors.

The cannabis industry in the United States is highly fragmented, rapidly expanding and evolving. The industry is characterized by new and potentially disruptive or conflicting legislation propounded on a state-by-state basis. Our competitors may be local or international enterprises and may have financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources greater than ours. These companies may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and consultants.

Our competitive position will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified underwriters and loan managers, consultants and advisors with industry depth, and talented managerial, operational and other personnel. Our competitive position will also depend on our ability to develop and acquire effective proprietary products and solutions, personal relationships of our executive officers and directors, and our ability to secure adequate capital resources. We compete to attract and retain customers of our services. We expect to compete in this area on the basis of price, regulatory compliance, vendor relationships, usefulness, availability, and ease of use of our services.

Government and Industry Regulation 

Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized, its use, possession, or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the &#147;DOJ&#148;) defines Schedule I controlled substances as &#147;the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.&#148; If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to cannabis, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and / or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.

As of the date of this filing, 23 states and the District of Columbia allow their residents to use medical cannabis. Voters in the states of Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska have approved ballot measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use. The state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act (the &#147;CSA&#148;), which makes cannabis use and possession illegal on a national level. The Obama administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. In March 2015, legislation was introduced in the U.S. Senate proposing to change federal law such that states could regulate medical use of cannabis without risk of prosecution. A key component of the proposed Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act (the &#147;CARERS Act&#148;) is to reclassify cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act to Schedule II, thereby 

changing the plant from a federally-criminalized substance to one that has recognized medical uses. There is no guarantee that the administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of federal laws. Additionally, any new administration could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal government&#146;s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not currently harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal government.

As of the date of this filing, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities. We do not grow or distribute cannabis. However, our providing ancillary products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law. We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo (see &#147;The Cole Memo&#148;), however, we cannot provide assurance that we are in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other federal laws or regulations.

The Cole Memo 

We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in. We realize that there is a discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities. The CSA makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis. Many states impose and enforce similar prohibitions. Notwithstanding the federal ban, as of the date of this filing, twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized certain cannabis-related activity.

In light of these developments, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued a memorandum (the &#147;Cole Memo&#148;) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. The Cole Memo guidance applies to all of DOJ&#146;s federal enforcement activity, including civil enforcement and criminal investigations and prosecutions, concerning cannabis in all states.

The Cole Memo reiterates Congress&#146;s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo notes that DOJ is committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also notes that DOJ is committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the &#147;Enforcement Priorities&#148;):

&#183;

Preventing the distribution of cannabis to minors;

&#183;

Preventing revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;

&#183;

Preventing the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;

&#183;

Preventing state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;

&#183;

Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;

&#183;

Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;

&#183;

Preventing the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and

&#183;

Preventing cannabis possession or use on federal property.

Deputy Attorney General Cole is issuing supplemental guidance directing that prosecutors also consider the Enforcement Priorities with respect to federal money laundering, unlicensed money transmitter, and BSA offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA.

FinCEN 

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#147;FinCEN&#148;) provided guidance on February 14, 2014 about how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (&#147;BSA&#148;) obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a &#147;financial institution&#148; includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:

&#183;

Bank (except bank credit card systems);

&#183;

Broker or dealer in securities;

&#183;

Money services business;

&#183;

Telegraph company;

&#183;

Casino;

&#183;

Card club; and

&#183;

A person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority.

In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.

In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.

As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business implicates one of the Cole Memo priorities or violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcement&#146;s priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports.

While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain but expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCEN&#146;s guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.

Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.

State and Local Regulations 

Where applicable, we will apply for state licenses that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws. As of the date of this Annual Report, our subsidiary, ACS Corp., has registered with Colorado&#146;s Marijuana Enforcement Division (the &#147;MED&#148;) as an approved vendor. On September 8, 2014, ACS was registered as a MED approved vendor. On March 11, 2015, GCS was registered as a MED approved vendor.

Local laws at the city, county and municipal level add an additional layer of complexity to legalized cannabis. Despite a state&#146;s having adopted legislation legalizing cannabis, cities, counties and municipalities, within the state seem to have the ability to otherwise restrict cannabis activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail or consumption.

Zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city, county or municipality. Zoning is set by local governments and may otherwise be restricted by state laws, for example, under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within 1,000 feet of a school. There are and or will be similar restrictions imposed on cannabis operators, which will restrict how and where cannabis operations can be located and the manner and size of which they can grow and operate. Additionally, zoning is subject to change, properties can be re-zoned and a given zoning may be withdrawn. How properties are zoned will have a direct impact on our business operations.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had thirteen full time salaried employees and approximately 80 hourly employees. None of our employees are members of a trade union. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees, and have not experienced any strikes or shutdowns and have not been involved in any labor disputes.
