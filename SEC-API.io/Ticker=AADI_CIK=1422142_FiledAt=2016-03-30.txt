 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Zeta Acquisition Corp. II (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or the &#8220;Registrant&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 16, 2007. Since inception, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination and has made no efforts to identify a possible business combination. As a result, the Company has not conducted negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any target business. The business purpose of the Company is to seek the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company. The Company selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 

&#160; 

The Company is currently considered to be a &#8220;blank check&#8221; company. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) defines those companies as &#8220;any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.&#8221; Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a &#8220;shell company,&#8221; because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of &#8220;blank check&#8221; companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Company is an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221;, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (&#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;), and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and exemptions from the requirements of Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to hold a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

&#160; 

The Company has also elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 

&#160; 

We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion, (2) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, (3) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), or (4) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221;, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. 

&#160; 

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company&#8217;s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. 

&#160; 

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the Company. As of this date the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party regarding business opportunities for the Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities in that it may seek a business combination target located in any industry or location. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors: 

&#160; &#160;

a) Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; &#160;

b) Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; &#160;

c) Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; &#160;

d) Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; &#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

e) The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; &#160;

f) The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; and &#160;

g) The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items. &#160;

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company&#8217;s limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources and the inexperience of our management with respect to such activities. We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business&#8217;s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, including but not limited to attorneys, accountants, consultants or such other professionals. At this time the Company has not specifically identified any third parties that it may engage. The costs associated with hiring third parties to complete a business combination target may be significant and are difficult to determine as such costs may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company and the size and the complexity of the target company. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or others associated with the target business seeking our participation. 

&#160;

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. The amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company and the size and complexity of the business of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated with completing a business combination transaction. The time and costs required to complete a business combination transaction can be ascertained once a business combination target has been identified. Any costs incurred with respect to evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. There are numerous &#8220;public shell&#8221; companies either actively or passively seeking operating businesses with which to merge in addition to a large number of &#8220;blank check&#8221; companies formed and capitalized specifically to acquire operating businesses. Additionally, we are subject to competition from other companies looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities with a business objective similar to ours to acquire a target business on favorable terms. 

&#160; 

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Many of our target business&#8217; competitors are likely to be significantly larger and have far greater financial and other resources than we will. Some of these competitors may be divisions or subsidiaries of large, diversified companies that have access to financial resources of their respective parent companies. Our target business may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other projects. In addition, it is likely that our target business will face significant competition from smaller companies that have specialized capabilities in similar areas. We cannot accurately predict how our target business&#8217; competitive position may be affected by changing economic conditions, customer requirements or technical developments. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively. 

&#160; 

Form of Acquisition 

&#160; 

The manner in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters. 

&#160; 

It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called &#8220;tax free&#8221; reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other &#8220;tax free&#8221; provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. 

&#160; 

The stockholders of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company&#8217;s directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders. 

&#160; 

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders&#8217; meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval. 

&#160; 

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers and directors are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
