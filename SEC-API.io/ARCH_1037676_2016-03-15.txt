 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

We are one of the world&#146;s largest coal producers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold approximately 128 million tons of coal, including approximately 1.4 million tons of coal we purchased from third parties. We sell substantially all of our coal to power plants, steel mills and industrial facilities. At December 31, 2015, we operated, or contracted out the operation of, 16 active mines located in each of the major coal-producing regions of the United States. The locations of our mines and access to export facilities enable us to ship coal worldwide. 

&#160; 

Our History 

&#160; 

We were organized in Delaware in 1969 as Arch Mineral Corporation. In July 1997, we merged with Ashland Coal, Inc., a subsidiary of Ashland Inc. that was formed in 1975. As a result of the merger, we became one of the largest producers of low-sulfur coal in the eastern United States. 

&#160; 

In June 1998, we expanded into the western United States when we acquired the coal assets of Atlantic Richfield Company. This acquisition included the Black Thunder and Coal Creek mines in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, the West Elk mine in Colorado and a 65% interest in Canyon Fuel Company, which operated three mines in Utah. In October 1998, we acquired a leasehold interest in the Thundercloud reserve, a 412-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder mine. 

&#160; 

In July 2004, we acquired the remaining 35% interest in Canyon Fuel Company. In August 2004, we acquired Triton Coal Company&#146;s North Rochelle mine adjacent to our Black Thunder operation. In September 2004, we acquired a leasehold interest in the Little Thunder reserve, a 719-million-ton federal reserve tract adjacent to the Black Thunder mine. 

&#160; 

In December 2005, we sold the stock of Hobet Mining, Inc., Apogee Coal Company and Catenary Coal Company and their four associated mining complexes (Hobet 21, Arch of West Virginia, Samples and Campbells Creek) and approximately 455 million tons of coal reserves in Central Appalachia to Magnum Coal Company, which was subsequently acquired by Patriot Coal Corporation. 

&#160; 

In October 2009, we acquired Rio Tinto&#146;s Jacobs Ranch mine complex in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, which included 345 million tons of low-cost, low-sulfur coal reserves, and integrated it into the Black Thunder mine. 

&#160; 

In June 2011, we acquired International Coal Group, Inc., which owned and operated mines primarily in the Appalachian Region of the United States. 

&#160; 

In August 2013, we sold the equity interests of Canyon Fuel Company, LLC (&#147;Canyon Fuel&#148;), which owned and operated our Utah operations. 

&#160; 

Filing Under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code 

&#160; 

On January 11, 2016 (the &#147;Petition Date&#148;), Arch and substantially all of Arch&#146;s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (the &#147;Filing Subsidiaries&#148; and, together with Arch, the &#147;Debtors&#148;) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (collectively, the &#147;Bankruptcy Petitions&#148;) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the &#147;Bankruptcy Code&#148;) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the &#147;Court&#148;). The Debtor&#146;s Chapter 11 Cases (collectively, the &#147;Chapter 11 Cases&#148;) are being jointly administered under the caption In re Arch Coal, Inc., et al. Case No. 16-40120 (lead case). Each Debtor will continue to operate its business as a &#147;debtor in possession&#148; under the jurisdiction of the Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Court. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions constituted an event of default that accelerated Arch&#146;s obligations under the documents governing each of Arch&#146;s 7.00% senior notes due 2019, 9.875% senior notes due 2019, 8.00% senior secured second lien notes due 2019, 7.25% senior notes due 2020, 7.25% senior notes due 2021 (together, the &#147;senior notes&#148;) and senior secured first lien term loan due 2018 (the &#147;Existing Credit Agreement&#148;) (collectively with the senior notes, the &#147;Debt Instruments&#148;), all as further described in Note 14, &#147;Debt and Financing Arrangements&#148; to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Form 10-K. Immediately after filing the Bankruptcy Petitions, Arch began notifying all known current or potential creditors of the Debtors of the bankruptcy filings. 

&#160; 

Additionally, on the Petition Date, the New York Stock Exchange (the &#147;NYSE&#148;) determined that Arch was no longer suitable for listing pursuant to Section 8.02.01D of the NYSE continued listing standards, and trading in the Company&#146;s common stock was suspended on January 11, 2016. We expect that the existing common stock of the Company will be extinguished upon the Company&#146;s emergence from Chapter 11 and existing equity holders will not receive consideration in respect of their equity interests. 

&#160; 

On the Petition Date, the Debtors filed a number of motions with the Court generally designed to stabilize their operations and facilitate the Debtors&#146; transition into Chapter 11. Certain of these motions sought authority from the Court for the Debtors to make payments upon, or otherwise honor, certain pre-petition obligations (e.g., obligations related to certain employee wages, salaries and benefits and certain vendors and other providers essential to the Debtors&#146; businesses). The Court has entered orders approving the relief sought in these motions. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions automatically stayed most actions against the Debtors, including actions to collect indebtedness incurred prior to the Petition Date or to exercise control over the Debtors&#146; property. Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the Debtors&#146; Chapter 11 Cases also automatically stayed the continuation of most legal proceedings, including certain of the third party litigation matters described under &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; or the filing of other actions against or on behalf of the Debtors or their property to recover on, collect or secure a claim arising prior to the Petition Date or to exercise control over property of the Debtors&#146; bankruptcy estates, unless and until the Court modifies or lifts the automatic stay as to any such claim. Notwithstanding the general application of the automatic stay described above, governmental authorities may determine to continue actions brought under their police and regulatory powers. 

&#160; 

As required by the Bankruptcy Code, the U.S. Trustee for the Eastern District of Missouri appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors (the &#147;Creditors&#146; Committee&#148;) on January 25, 2016. The Creditors&#146; Committee represents all unsecured creditors of the Debtors and has a right to be heard on all matters that come before the Court. 

&#160; 

As a result of extremely challenging current market conditions, Arch believes it will require a significant restructuring of its balance sheet in order to continue as a going concern in the long term. The Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to become profitable and maintain profitability and its ability to successfully implement its Chapter 11 plan strategy. As a result of the Bankruptcy Petitions, the realization of the Debtors&#146; assets and the satisfaction of liabilities are subject to significant uncertainty. While operating as a debtor-in-possession pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the Company may sell or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets or settle liabilities, subject to the approval of the Court or as otherwise permitted in the ordinary course of business for amounts other than those reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Further, a Chapter 11 plan is likely to materially change the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities reported in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Restructuring Support Agreement 

&#160; 

In connection with the filing of the Bankruptcy Petitions, Arch entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement, dated as of January 10, 2016 (the &#147;Restructuring Support Agreement&#148;), among the Debtors and holders of over 50% of Arch&#146;s first lien term loans under Arch&#146;s Existing Credit Agreement (the &#147;Supporting First Lien Creditors&#148;), providing that the Supporting First Lien Creditors will support a restructuring of the Debtors, subject to the following terms and conditions contemplated therein, among others: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; existing common stock of Arch would likely be extinguished upon the Company&#146;s emergence from Chapter 11, and existing equity holders would likely not receive consideration in respect of their equity interests;

&#160; 

&#183; claims against the Debtors arising under the DIP Facility (as defined below) would be paid in full in cash or receive such other treatment as may be consented to by the holders of such claims;

&#160; 

&#183; claims against the Debtors of holders of first lien term loans would be exchanged for (a) a combination of cash and $326.5 million (principal amount) of new first lien debt that would be issued by the reorganized Company and (b) 100% of the common stock of the reorganized Company outstanding on the effective date of the plan, subject to dilution on account of a proposed new management incentive plan and the distribution to unsecured creditors of any new common stock and warrants (as described below);

&#160; 

&#183; first lien term loan deficiency claims (subject to certain exceptions) as well as second lien notes, unsecured notes and general unsecured claims against the Debtors would be exchanged for either (1) common stock in the reorganized Company and warrants or (2) the value of the unencumbered assets of the Company, if any, after giving effect to certain other payments and claims;

&#160; 

&#183; either the Company&#146;s existing accounts receivable securitization facility would be reinstated or a new letter of credit facility would be entered into by the Company, in either case on terms acceptable to Supporting First Lien Creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the aggregate amount of the first lien term loans held by Supporting First Lien Creditors; and

&#160; 

&#183; the board of directors of the reorganized Company would consist of seven directors, at least one of whom would be independent, including the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and six directors selected by certain of the Company&#146;s first-lien term lenders in consultation with the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer.

&#160; 

The Restructuring Support Agreement, if utilized as the basis for a plan of reorganization, is expected to reduce Arch&#146;s long-term debt by more than $4.5 billion. 

&#160; 

We entered into an amendment to the Restructuring Support Agreement on February 25, 2016 (the &#147;RSA Amendment&#148;), which provides for the waiver of the termination event that would have occurred on February 25, 2016 as a result of the Debtors not having obtained Court approval of the assumption of the Restructuring Support Agreement within 45 days of the Petition Date. The Debtors had previously agreed, with the consent of the Majority Consenting Lenders under the Restructuring Support Agreement, to adjourn the Court hearing on the Restructuring Support Agreement at the request of the official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in the Debtors&#146; Chapter 11 cases. Pursuant to the RSA Amendment, unless otherwise agreed by the Majority Consenting Lenders, the Debtors are required to obtain Court approval of the assumption of the Restructuring Support Agreement on or before the date that is 90 days from the Petition Date. 

&#160; 

The RSA Amendment also provides for a waiver of any termination event that otherwise would occur as a result of the dismissal of the Chapter 11 case of one of our subsidiaries following the sale of such subsidiary and a 45-day extension of the date after which the Debtors and the Majority Consenting Lenders may modify the proposed distributions to holders of unsecured claims if holders of more than $1.6125 billion of unsecured claims against the Debtors have not executed a restructuring support agreement substantially in the form of the Restructuring Support Agreement. 

&#160; 

Securitization Agreement 

&#160; 

On January 13, 2016, Arch and its securitization financing providers (the &#147;Securitization Financing Providers&#148;) agreed that, subject to certain amendments (the &#147;Amendments&#148;), they will continue the $200 million trade accounts receivable securitization facility provided to Arch Receivable Company, LLC, a non-debtor special-purpose entity that is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#147;Arch Receivable&#148;) (the &#147;Securitization Facility&#148;). See Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&#151;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#151;Securitization Agreement&#148; for more information. 

&#160; 

Debtor-In-Possession Financing 

&#160; 

On January 21, 2016, the Superpriority Secured Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement, as amended by the Waiver and Consent and Amendment No. 1, dated as of March 4, 2016, (the &#147;DIP Credit Agreement&#148;) was entered into by and among the Company, as borrower, certain of the Debtors, as guarantors (the &#147;Guarantors&#148; and, together with the Company, the &#147;Loan Parties&#148;), the lenders from time to time party thereto (the &#147;DIP Lenders&#148;) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent for the DIP Lenders (in such capacities, the &#147;DIP Agent&#148;). 

&#160; 

The DIP Credit Agreement, which has been approved by the Court on a final basis, provides for a super-priority senior secured debtor-in-possession credit facility (the &#147;DIP Facility&#148;) consisting of term loans (collectively, the &#147;DIP Term Loan&#148;) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $275 million that may be funded in not more than two draws not later than six months after the effective date of the DIP Facility (such six month period, the &#147;Availability Period&#148;). Any portion of the DIP Term Loan commitment that has not been funded on or prior to the end of the Availability Period will be permanently cancelled. The 

&#160; 

&#160; 

DIP Facility includes a $75 million carve-out from the first priority lien granted in favor of the DIP Agent for the benefit of the DIP Lenders on all encumbered and unencumbered assets of the Loan Parties for super-priority claims relating to certain of the Debtors&#146; bonding obligations. See Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis&#151;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#151;Debtor-In-Possession Financing&#148; for more information. 

&#160; 

Coal Characteristics 

&#160; 

End users generally characterize coal as steam coal or metallurgical coal. Heat value, sulfur, ash, moisture content, and volatility, in the case of metallurgical coal, are important variables in the marketing and transportation of coal. These characteristics help producers determine the best end use of a particular type of coal. The following is a description of these general coal characteristics: 

&#160; 

Heat Value. &#160; In general, the carbon content of coal supplies most of its heating value, but other factors also influence the amount of energy it contains per unit of weight. The heat value of coal is commonly measured in Btus. Coal is generally classified into four categories, lignite, subbituminous, bituminous and anthracite, reflecting the progressive response of individual deposits of coal to increasing heat and pressure. Anthracite is coal with the highest carbon content and, therefore, the highest heat value, nearing 15,000 Btus per pound. Bituminous coal, used primarily to generate electricity and to make coke for the steel industry, has a heat value ranging between 10,500 and 15,500 Btus per pound. Subbituminous coal ranges from 8,300 to 13,000 Btus per pound and is generally used for electric power generation. Lignite coal is a geologically young coal which has the lowest carbon content and a heat value ranging between 4,000 and 8,300 Btus per pound.

&#160; 

Sulfur Content. &#160; Federal and state environmental regulations, including regulations that limit the amount of sulfur dioxide that may be emitted as a result of combustion, have affected and may continue to affect the demand for certain types of coal. The sulfur content of coal can vary from seam to seam and within a single seam. The chemical composition and concentration of sulfur in coal affects the amount of sulfur dioxide produced in combustion. Coal-fueled power plants can comply with sulfur dioxide emission regulations by burning coal with low sulfur content, blending coals with various sulfur contents, purchasing emission allowances on the open market and/or using sulfur-dioxide emission reduction technology.

&#160; 

Ash. &#160; Ash is the inorganic residue remaining after the combustion of coal. As with sulfur, ash content varies from seam to seam. Ash content is an important characteristic of coal because it impacts boiler performance and electric generating plants must handle and dispose of ash following combustion. The composition of the ash, including the proportion of sodium oxide and fusion temperature, is also an important characteristic of coal, as it helps to determine the suitability of the coal to end users. The absence of ash is also important to the process by which metallurgical coal is transformed into coke for use in steel production.

&#160; 

Moisture. &#160; Moisture content of coal varies by the type of coal, the region where it is mined and the location of the coal within a seam. In general, high moisture content decreases the heat value and increases the weight of the coal, thereby making it more expensive to transport. Moisture content in coal, on an as-sold basis, can range from approximately 2% to over 30% of the coal&#146;s weight.

&#160; 

Other. &#160; Users of metallurgical coal measure certain other characteristics, including fluidity, swelling capacity and volatility to assess the strength of coke produced from a given coal or the amount of coke that certain types of coal will yield. These characteristics may be important elements in determining the value of the metallurgical coal we produce and market.

&#160; 

The Coal Industry 

&#160; 

Background. &#160; Coal is traded globally and can be transported to demand centers by ship, rail, barge or truck. Total world coal production reached 7.7 billion tonnes in 2014, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Total hard coal production decreased 0.5% to an estimated 6.9 billion tonnes in 2014 from 2013 levels, while global production of lignite coal declined roughly 3% to 810 million tonnes. Also according to IEA estimates, China remained the largest producer of coal in the world, producing over 3.5 billion tonnes in 2014. The United States and India follow China with total coal production of over

&#160; 

&#160; 

900 million tonnes and 600 million tonnes, respectively, in 2014. Preliminary data for 2015 suggests further erosion in global coal demand, but the relative ranking of producer countries remained the same. 

&#160; 

Cross-border trade of coal was close to 1.4 billion tonnes in 2014, according to the IEA. Despite a drop in coal imports, China remained the largest importer of globally traded coal in 2014, taking over 305 million tonnes. India and Japan followed China with total coal imports of over 239 million tonnes and 187 million tonnes, respectively. Imports in OECD Europe were slightly higher in 2014 at an estimated 280 million tonnes. 

&#160; 

The primary nations that are supplying coal to the global power and steel markets are Australia and Indonesia, as well as Russia, the United States, Colombia and South Africa. The IEA estimates that these key supply regions combined made up 86% of total global cross-border coal trade in 2014. 

&#160; 

Global Coal Supply and Demand. &#160; The supply and demand fundamentals in global coal markets were further challenged in 2015. In China, a slowing economy along with new environmental restrictions and protectionist policies aiming to support the domestic coal industry resulted in a significant decline in coal imports in 2015 according to preliminary reports. China continues to add coal-based power generation capacity at a robust pace, but slower economic growth and/or additional regulations could continue to pressure demand in the near to intermediate term. Preliminary reports indicated that imports of metallurgical and thermal coal into China decreased by 11 and 43 million tonnes in 2015, respectively. The decline was primarily caused by weak industrial production and protectionist measures favoring domestic supply. Conversely, India is estimated to have sustained strong demand for both thermal and metallurgical coal in 2015 due to solid economic growth and associated electric power and infrastructure projects. Europe&#146;s weak economic growth combined with increased competition from other fuels and renewables resulted in further declines in import coal demand there. Additionally, economic uncertainties as well as the low-cost external supply of steel have pressured Europe&#146;s domestic steel producers which has translated into lower demand for metallurgical coal.

&#160; 

The IEA publishes a World Energy Outlook (&#147;WEO&#148;) in which it reports on multiple scenarios. For example, the &#147;New Policies Scenario&#148; incorporates policies and measures affecting energy markets that have already been adopted, as well as other relevant commitments and plans that have been announced by countries, including national pledges to reduce emissions and plans to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, even if the measures to implement these commitments have yet to be identified or announced. The &#147;Current Policies Scenario&#148; contemplates no changes in policies from the mid-point of the year of publication, assuming that governments do not implement any commitments that have yet to be finalized by legislation and will not introduce any new policies affecting coal usage. Finally, the &#147;450 Scenario&#148; assumes implementation of a set of government policies consistent with a goal of limiting long-term increases in the average global temperature to two degrees Celsius, a limit determined by various governments and non-governmental organizations and recognized by nations of the world in the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference. 

&#160; 

The IEA makes projections about world coal demand based on various future scenarios for energy development. The scenarios used by the IEA as the bases for these projections vary by time and publication. Further details are available to the public directly from the IEA, including through the IEA&#146;s website: http://www.iea.org/publications/scenariosandprojections/. Information contained on or accessible through the IEA&#146;s website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

The IEA estimates in its WEO 2015, Current Policies Scenario, that worldwide primary energy demand will grow 45%, whereas the New Policies Scenario projects 32% growth, between 2013 and 2040. Demand for coal during this time period is projected to rise 43% and 12% under the Current Policies Scenario and the New Policies Scenario, respectively. 

&#160; 

The IEA expects coal to retain its prominent presence as a fuel for the power sector worldwide under the Current Policies Scenario. Coal&#146;s share of the power generation mix was 41% in 2013. By 2040, the IEA&#146;s Current Policies Scenario estimates that coal&#146;s fuel share of global power generation will be 38% as it continues to have the largest share of worldwide electric power production. Under the New Policies and 450 scenarios, coal&#146;s fuel share of global power generation is projected to be 30% and 12%, respectively. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Most coal consumption growth is expected to occur in Asia, with China and India as the largest consumers going forward. In the metallurgical markets, we expect somewhat modest growth in near-term steel demand based on slower economic growth. Moreover, we expect continued supply rationalization for global metallurgical coal. 

&#160; 

The IEA also projects that global natural gas-fueled electricity generation will grow from 22% share in 2013 to 24% under the Current Policies scenario. IEA&#146;s New Policies Scenario shows gas share growing only slightly to 23% share by 2040. However, under the 450 Scenario, natural gas share declines to 16% by 2040. The 450 Scenario assumes the generation share from renewable sources will grown more than fivefold from 6% in 2013 to 32% by 2040. Electricity generation from nuclear power is expected to fall from 11% to 9% under the Current Policies Scenario, while growing to 11% or 18% under the New Policies and 450 scenarios, respectively. 

&#160; 

As noted above, projected coal usage is highest under the Current Policies Scenario. Future energy use consistent with the 450 Scenario would likely yield results materially lower than the projections noted above under the Current Policies Scenario or the New Policies Scenario. 

&#160; 

U.S. Coal Consumption. &#160; In the United States, coal is used primarily by power plants to generate electricity, by steel companies to produce coke for use in blast furnaces, and by a variety of industrial users to heat and power foundries, cement plants, paper mills, chemical plants and other manufacturing or processing facilities. Although final data are not yet available, coal consumption in the United States is estimated to be approximately 809 million tons in 2015, according to the Energy Information Administration&#146;s (EIA) Short Term Energy Outlook. Coal consumption decreased in 2015 by 12%, or around 108 million tons.

&#160; 

According to the EIA, coal accounted for approximately 33% of U.S. electricity generation in 2015. This is 5 percentage points lower than the same period in 2014 and represents the lowest share for coal fueled power generation in at least 60 years. This decline in domestic coal consumption was caused by a convergence of factors including record high natural gas production along with the lowest natural gas prices since 1999, coal unit retirements following the implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards regulations and growing power generation from wind and solar. 

&#160; 

The following chart shows the breakdown of U.S. electricity generation by energy source for 2014 and 2015 according to the EIA: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Historically, coal has been considerably less expensive than natural gas or oil. However, the growth of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) combined with less-than-projected electric power demand has resulted in oversupply. Natural gas inventories at the end of 2015 were 3.6 trillion cubic feet, which was 535 Bcf (17%) above the end of 2014 and 15% above the five-year average. 

&#160; 

While demand for natural gas is expected to increase in the coming years from new industrial users and exports, the current oversupply has suppressed natural gas prices to levels where coal is less competitive. As drilling for new natural gas has dropped to at least a 28-year low, EIA expects natural gas prices to increase in the coming years which we expect to improve coal&#146;s relative competitiveness. 

&#160; 

While coal&#146;s prospects with regard to natural gas should improve, the effects of new regulations on the use of coal, particularly regarding carbon dioxide emissions and climate change impacts, are evolving. EIA&#146;s Annual Energy Outlook forecast does not reflect the impact of carbon regulations such as the Clean Power Plan on domestic coal consumption for power generation. However, EIA has published an analysis on the effects the Clean Power Plan would have on domestic coal consumption. EIA believes that even though the regulation targets coal use in power generation, coal will maintain a critical role for power generation in the U.S. 

&#160; 

Although the proposed Clean Power Plan rule results in less coal-fired electricity generation, several factors contribute to projected increases in coal generation from 2024 through 2040. Demand for electricity increases, and a combination of rising natural gas prices and increased renewable capacity translates to increased utilization at existing coal plants, even after significant amounts of coal capacity are retired. Also, in the Base Policy case, the standards set by the Clean Power Plan are assumed to remain constant after 2030. - EIA &#147;Today in Energy,&#148; June 10, 2015

&#160; 

Even though the validity of the Clean Power Plan is being tested by the courts, we included EIA&#146;s analysis of the originally proposed rule as a proxy for either the Clean Power Plan or other carbon regulations. We expect EIA will incorporate their analysis of the effects of the Clean Power Plan, which has been promulgated in 2015, in their upcoming release of the Annual Energy Outlook in April 2016. The 2020 and 2040 values are from EIA&#146;s analysis for the proposed Clean Power Plan published on May 22, 2015:

U.S. Coal Production. &#160; The United States is the second largest coal producer in the world, exceeded only by China. According to the EIA, there are over 200 billion tons of recoverable coal in the United States. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that current domestic recoverable coal reserves could supply enough electricity to satisfy domestic demand for over 150 years.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Coal is mined from coal fields throughout the United States, with the major production centers located in the western United States, the Appalachian region and the Interior. According to the EIA and MSHA, U.S. coal production declined an estimated 109 million tons in 2015, to 891 million tons. 

&#160; 

The EIA subdivides United States coal production into three major areas: Western, Appalachia and Interior. 

&#160; 

The Western area includes the Powder River Basin and the Western Bituminous region. According to the EIA, coal produced in the western United States declined from an estimated 542 million tons in 2014 to 494 million tons in 2015. The Powder River Basin is located in northeastern Wyoming and southeastern Montana and is the largest producing region in the United States. Coal from this region is sub-bituminous coal with low sulfur content ranging from 0.2% to 0.9% and heating values ranging from 8,000 to 9,500 Btu. The price of Powder River Basin coal is generally less than that of coal produced in other regions because Powder River Basin coal exists in greater abundance and is easier to mine and, thus, has a lower cost of production. The Western Bituminous region includes Colorado, Utah and southern Wyoming. Coal from this region typically has low sulfur content ranging from 0.4% to 0.8% and heating values ranging from 10,000 to 12,200 Btu. 

&#160; 

The Appalachia region is further divided into north, central and southern regions. According to the EIA, coal produced in the Appalachian region fell from 268 million tons in 2014 to 228 million tons in 2015. Appalachian coal is located near the prolific eastern shale-gas producing regions. Central Appalachia is further disadvantaged for power generation because of the depletion of economically attractive reserves, permitting issues and increasing costs of production. Central Appalachia includes eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia and southern West Virginia. Coal mined from this region generally has a high heat value ranging from 11,400 to 13,200 Btu and a sulfur content ranging from 0.2% to 2.0%. Northern Appalachia includes Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. Coal from this region generally has a high heat value ranging from 10,300 to 13,500 Btu and a sulfur content ranging from 0.8% to 4.0%. Southern Appalachia primarily covers Alabama and generally has a heat content ranging from 11,300 to 12,300 Btu and a sulfur content ranging from 0.7% to 3.0%. 

&#160; 

The Interior region includes the Illinois Basin, Gulf Lignite production in Texas and Louisiana, and a small producing area in Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas. The Illinois Basin is the largest producing region in the Interior and consists of Illinois, Indiana and western Kentucky. According to the EIA, coal produced in the Interior region fell from 189 million tons in 2014 to approximately 169 million tons in 2015. Coal from the Illinois Basin generally has a heat value ranging from 10,100 to 12,600 Btu and has a sulfur content ranging from 1.0% to 4.3%. Despite its high sulfur content, coal from the Illinois Basin can generally be used by electric power generation facilities that have installed emissions control devices, such as scrubbers. 

&#160; 

U.S. Coal Exports and Imports. &#160; Coal exports declined approximately 20 million tons to 77 million tons in 2015. The decline was primarily caused by growing global coal supply along with slowing demand growth which displaced some of the volume originating in the United States. Additionally, unfavorable foreign currency exchange disadvantaged some United States coal in certain markets. The seaborne market is cyclical, but in their New Policies Scenario the IEA projects seaborne coal trade to grow to 1.1 billion tonnes by 2020, an increase of 59 million tons from 2015 levels.

&#160; 

Historically, coal imported from abroad has represented a relatively small share of total domestic coal consumption, and this remained the case in 2015. Imports reached close to 36 million tons in 2007, but have fallen since then. According to the EIA, coal imports were 11.3 million tons in 2015. The decline is mostly attributable to more competitive pricing for domestic coal. The majority of the coal imported into the United States originates from Colombia. 

&#160; 

Coal Mining Methods 

&#160; 

The geological characteristics of our coal reserves largely determine the coal mining method we employ. We use two primary methods of mining coal: surface mining and underground mining. 

&#160; 

Surface Mining. &#160; We use surface mining when coal is found close to the surface. We have included the identity and location of our surface mining operations below under &#147;&#151;Our Mining Operations-General.&#148; The majority of the coal we produce comes from surface mining operations.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Surface mining involves removing the topsoil then drilling and blasting the overburden (earth and rock covering the coal) with explosives. We then remove the overburden with heavy earth-moving equipment, such as draglines, power shovels, excavators and loaders. Once exposed, we drill, fracture and systematically remove the coal using haul trucks or conveyors to transport the coal to a preparation plant or to a loadout facility. We reclaim disturbed areas as part of our normal mining activities. After final coal removal, we use draglines, power shovels, excavators or loaders to backfill the remaining pits with the overburden removed at the beginning of the process. Once we have replaced the overburden and topsoil, we reestablish vegetation and plant life into the natural habitat and make other improvements that have local community and environmental benefits. 

&#160; 

The following diagram illustrates a typical dragline surface mining operation: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Underground Mining. &#160; We use underground mining methods when coal is located deep beneath the surface. We have included the identity and location of our underground mining operations below under &#147;Our Mining Operations-General.&#148;

&#160; 

Our underground mines are typically operated using one or both of two different mining techniques: longwall mining and room-and-pillar mining. 

&#160; 

Longwall Mining. &#160; Longwall mining involves using a mechanical shearer to extract coal from long rectangular blocks of medium to thick seams. Ultimate seam recovery using longwall mining techniques can exceed 75%. In longwall mining, continuous miners are used to develop access to these long rectangular coal blocks. Hydraulically powered supports temporarily hold up the roof of the mine while a rotating drum mechanically advances across the face of the coal seam, cutting the coal from the face. Chain conveyors then move the loosened coal to an underground mine conveyor system for delivery to the surface. Once coal is extracted from an area, the roof is allowed to collapse in a controlled fashion. The following diagram illustrates a typical underground mining operation using longwall mining techniques:

&#160; 

&#160; 

Room - and - Pillar Mining. &#160; Room-and-pillar mining is effective for small blocks of thin coal seams. In room-and-pillar mining, a network of rooms is cut into the coal seam, leaving a series of pillars of coal to support the roof of the mine. Continuous miners are used to cut the coal and shuttle cars are used to transport the coal to a conveyor belt for further transportation to the surface. The pillars generated as part of this mining method can constitute up to 40% of the total coal in a seam. Higher seam recovery rates can be achieved if retreat mining is used. In retreat mining, coal is mined from the pillars as workers retreat. As retreat mining occurs, the roof is allowed to collapse in a controlled fashion.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The following diagram illustrates our typical underground mining operation using room-and-pillar mining techniques: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Coal Preparation and Blending. &#160; We crush the coal mined from our Powder River Basin mining complexes and ship it directly from our mines to the customer. Typically, no additional preparation is required for a saleable product. Coal extracted from some of our underground mining operations contains impurities, such as rock, shale and clay occupying a wide range of particle sizes. The majority of our mining operations in the Appalachia region use a coal preparation plant located near the mine or connected to the mine by a conveyor. These coal preparation plants allow us to treat the coal we extract from those mines to ensure a consistent quality and to enhance its suitability for particular end-users. In addition, depending on coal quality and customer requirements, we may blend coal mined from different locations, including coal produced by third parties, in order to achieve a more suitable product.

&#160; 

The treatments we employ at our preparation plants depend on the size of the raw coal. For coarse material, the separation process relies on the difference in the density between coal and waste rock and, for the very fine fractions, the separation process relies on the difference in surface chemical properties between coal and the waste minerals. To remove impurities, we crush raw coal and classify it into various sizes. For the largest size fractions, we use dense media vessel separation techniques in which we float coal in a tank containing a liquid of a pre-determined specific gravity. Since coal is lighter than its impurities, it floats, and we can separate it from rock and shale. We treat intermediate sized particles with dense medium cyclones, in which a liquid is spun at high speeds to separate coal from rock. Fine coal is treated in spirals, in which the differences in density between coal and rock allow them, when suspended in water, to be separated. Ultra fine coal is recovered in column flotation cells utilizing the differences in surface chemistry between coal and rock. By injecting stable air bubbles through a suspension of ultra fine coal and rock, the coal particles adhere to the bubbles and rise to the surface of the column where they are removed. To minimize the moisture content in coal, we process most coal sizes through centrifuges. A centrifuge spins coal very quickly, causing water accompanying the coal to separate. 

&#160;

Our Mining Operations 

&#160; 

General. &#160; At December 31, 2015, we operated, or contracted out the operation of, 13 active mines in the United States. Our reportable segments are based on the major coal producing basins in which we operate. Our reportable segments are the Powder River Basin segment, with operations in Wyoming; and the Appalachia segment, with operations in West Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland and Virginia. We also sell coal from operations in Colorado and Illinois. Geology, coal transportation routes to consumers, regulatory environments and coal quality can vary from segment to segment. We incorporate by reference the information about the operating results of each of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 contained in Note 27 beginning on page F-52.

&#160; 

In general, we have developed our mining complexes and preparation plants at strategic locations in close proximity to rail or barge shipping facilities. Coal is transported from our mining complexes to customers by means of railroads, trucks, barge lines, and ocean-going vessels from terminal facilities. We currently own or lease under long-term arrangements a substantial portion of the equipment utilized in our mining operations. We employ sophisticated preventative maintenance and rebuild programs and upgrade our equipment to ensure that it is productive, well-maintained and cost-competitive.

&#160; 

The Leer Complex is designed to have 3.5 million tons of capacity per year of high quality coal that is well suited to both the high volatile metallurgical and utility markets. All the production is processed through a 1,400 ton-per-hour preparation plant and loaded on the CSX railroad. A 15,000-ton train can be loaded in less than four hours. Without the addition of more coal reserves, the current reserves could sustain the longwall mine at current production levels until about 2029 and support continuous miner production until 2035. 

&#160; 

Other 

&#160; 

West Elk. &#160; West Elk is an underground mining complex located on approximately 17,800 acres in Gunnison County, Colorado. The West Elk mining complex extracts steam coal from the E seam.

&#160; 

We control a significant portion of the coal reserves through federal and state leases. The West Elk mining complex had approximately 53.5 million tons of proven and probable reserves at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The West Elk complex currently consists of a longwall, continuous miner sections and a loadout facility. We ship most of the coal raw to our customers via the Union Pacific railroad. The loadout facility can load an 11,000-ton train in less than three hours. 

&#160; 

Viper. &#160; The Viper mining complex consists of one underground coal mine and a preparation plant located on approximately 46,500 acres in central Illinois near the city of Springfield. Mining operations extract steam coal from the Illinois No. 5 seam, also referred to as the Springfield seam. All coal is processed through an 800 ton-per-hour preparation plant and shipped to customers by on-highway trucks.

&#160; 

We control a significant portion of the coal reserves through private leases. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 37.2 million tons of proven and probable reserves. 

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Trading 

&#160; 

Overview. &#160; Coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and can vary materially by region. The price of coal within a region is influenced by market conditions, coal quality, transportation costs involved in moving coal from the mine to the point of use and mine operating costs. For example, higher carbon and lower ash content generally result in higher prices, and higher sulfur and higher ash content generally result in lower prices within a given geographic region.

&#160; 

The cost of coal at the mine is also influenced by geologic characteristics such as seam thickness, overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves. It is generally less expensive to mine coal seams that are thick and located close to the surface than to mine thin underground seams. Within a particular geographic region, underground mining, which is the primary mining method we use in certain of our Appalachian mines, is generally more expensive than surface mining, which is the mining method we use in the Powder River Basin, and for certain of our Appalachian mines. This is the case because of the higher capital costs, including costs for construction of extensive ventilation systems, and higher per unit labor costs due to lower productivity associated with underground mining. 

&#160; 

Our sales, marketing and trading functions are principally based in St. Louis, Missouri and consist of sales and trading, transportation and distribution, quality control and contract administration personnel as well as revenue management. We also have smaller groups of sales personnel in our Singapore and London offices. In addition to selling coal produced in our mining complexes, from time to time we purchase and sell coal mined by others, some of which we blend with coal produced from our mines. We focus on meeting the needs and specifications of our customers rather than just selling our coal production. 

&#160; 

Customers. &#160; The Company markets its steam and metallurgical coal to domestic and foreign utilities, steel producers and other industrial facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived approximately 18% of our total coal revenues from sales to our three largest customers U.S. Steel, Southern Company and Tennessee Valley Authority - and approximately 39% of our total coal revenues from sales to our 10 largest customers.

&#160; 

In 2015, we sold coal to domestic customers located in 36 different states. The locations of our mines enable us to ship coal to most of the major coal-fueled power plants in the United States. 

&#160; 

In addition, in 2015 we also exported coal to Europe, Asia, North America (outside the United States) and South America. Exports to foreign countries were $0.4 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, trade receivables related to metallurgical-quality coal sales totaled $32.8 million and $76.0 million, respectively, or 28% of total trade receivables. We do not have foreign currency exposure for our international sales as all sales are denominated and settled in U.S. dollars. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s foreign revenues by coal shipment destination for the year ended December 31, 2015, were as follows:

Long-Term Coal Supply Arrangements 

&#160; 

As is customary in the coal industry, we enter into fixed price, fixed volume long-term supply contracts, the terms of which are more than one year, with many of our customers. Multiple year contracts usually have specific and possibly different volume and pricing arrangements for each year of the contract. Long-term contracts allow customers to secure a supply for their future needs and provide us with greater predictability of sales volume and sales prices. In 2015, we sold approximately 68% of our coal under long-term supply arrangements. The majority of our supply contracts include a fixed price for the term of the agreement or a pre-determined escalation in price for each year. Some of our long-term supply agreements may include a variable pricing system. While most of our sales contracts are for terms of one to five years, some are as short as one month and other contracts have terms exceeding five years. At December 31, 2015, the average volume-weighted remaining term of our long-term contracts was approximately 2.12 years, with remaining terms ranging from one to P5Y years. At December 31, 2015, remaining tons under long-term supply agreements, including those subject to price re-opener or extension provisions, were approximately 144 million tons. 

&#160; 

We typically sell coal to customers under long-term arrangements through a &#147;request-for-proposal&#148; process. The terms of our coal sales agreements result from competitive bidding and negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of these contracts vary by customer, including base price adjustment features, price re-opener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, future regulatory changes, extension options, force majeure , termination, damages and assignment provisions. Our long-term supply contracts typically contain provisions to adjust the base price due to new statutes, ordinances or regulations. Additionally, some of our contracts contain provisions that allow for the recovery of costs affected by modifications or changes in the interpretations or application of any applicable statute by local, state or federal government authorities. These provisions only apply to the base price of coal contained in these supply contracts. In some circumstances, a significant adjustment in base price can lead to termination of the contract. 

&#160; 

Certain of our contracts contain index provisions that change the price based on changes in market based indices or changes in economic indices or both. Certain of our contracts contain price re-opener provisions that may allow a party to commence a renegotiation of the contract price at a pre-determined time. Price re-opener provisions may automatically set a new price based on prevailing market price or, in some instances, require us to negotiate a new price, sometimes within a specified range of prices. In a limited number of agreements, if the parties do not agree on a new price, either party has an option to terminate the contract. In addition, certain of our contracts contain clauses that may allow customers to terminate the contract in the event of certain changes in environmental laws and regulations that impact their operations. 

&#160; 

Coal quality and volumes are stipulated in coal sales agreements. In most cases, the annual pricing and volume obligations are fixed, although in some cases the volume specified may vary depending on the customer consumption requirements. Most of our coal sales agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within certain ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat content (for thermal coal contracts), volatile matter (for metallurgical coal contracts), and for both types of contracts, sulfur, ash and moisture content. Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, suspension or cancellation of shipments or termination of the contracts. 

&#160; 

Our coal sales agreements also typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or our customers, during the duration of events beyond the control of the affected party, including events such as strikes, adverse mining conditions, mine closures or serious transportation problems that affect us or unanticipated plant outages that may affect the buyer. Our contracts also generally provide that in the event a force majeure circumstance exceeds a 

&#160; 

&#160; 

certain time period, the unaffected party may have the option to terminate the purchase or sale in whole or in part. Some contracts stipulate that this tonnage can be made up by mutual agreement or at the discretion of the buyer. Agreements between our customers and the railroads servicing our mines may also contain force majeure provisions. 

&#160; 

In most of our contracts, we have a right of substitution (unilateral or subject to counterparty approval), allowing us to provide coal from different mines, including third-party mines, as long as the replacement coal meets quality specifications and will be sold at the same equivalent delivered cost. 

&#160; 

In some of our coal supply contracts, we agree to indemnify or reimburse our customers for damage to their or their rail carrier&#146;s equipment while on our property, which result from our or our agents&#146; negligence, and for damage to our customer&#146;s equipment due to non-coal materials being included with our coal while on our property. 

&#160; 

Trading. &#160; In addition to marketing and selling coal to customers through traditional coal supply arrangements, we seek to optimize our coal production and leverage our knowledge of the coal industry through a variety of other marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies. From time to time, we may employ strategies to use coal and coal-related commodities and contracts for those commodities in order to manage and hedge volumes and/or prices associated with our coal sales or purchase commitments, reduce our exposure to the volatility of market prices or augment the value of our portfolio of traditional assets. These strategies may include physical coal contracts, as well as a variety of forward, futures or options contracts, swap agreements or other financial instruments.

&#160; 

We maintain a system of complementary processes and controls designed to monitor and manage our exposure to market and other risks that may arise as a consequence of these strategies. These processes and controls seek to preserve our ability to profit from certain marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies while mitigating our exposure to potential losses. You should see Item 7A, entitled &#147;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#148; for more information about the market risks associated with these strategies at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Transportation. &#160; We ship our coal to domestic customers by means of railcars, barges, vessels or trucks, or a combination of these means of transportation. We generally sell coal used for domestic consumption free on board (f.o.b.) at the mine or nearest loading facility. Our domestic customers normally bear the costs of transporting coal by rail, barge or vessel.

&#160; 

Historically, most domestic electricity generators have arranged long-term shipping contracts with rail or barge companies to assure stable delivery costs. Transportation can be a large component of a purchaser&#146;s total cost. Although the purchaser pays the freight, transportation costs still are important to coal mining companies because the purchaser may choose a supplier largely based on cost of transportation. Transportation costs borne by the customer vary greatly based on each customer&#146;s proximity to the mine and our proximity to the loadout facilities. Trucks and overland conveyors haul coal over shorter distances, while barges, Great Lake carriers and ocean vessels move coal to export markets and domestic markets requiring shipment over the Great Lakes and several river systems. 

&#160; 

Most coal mines are served by a single rail company, but much of the Powder River Basin is served by two rail carriers: the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe railroad and the Union Pacific railroad. We generally transport coal produced at our Appalachian mining complexes via the CSX railroad or the Norfolk Southern railroad. Besides rail deliveries, some customers in the eastern United States rely on a river barge system. 

&#160; 

We generally sell coal to international customers at the export terminal, and we are usually responsible for the cost of transporting coal to the export terminals. In some cases we may enter into long-term throughput agreements with export terminals that contain minimum throughput obligations. In the event we do not meet those minimum thresholds, we may be obligated to pay liquidated damage amounts to such terminals. We transport our coal to Atlantic coast terminals or terminals along the Gulf of Mexico for transportation to international customers. Our international customers are generally responsible for paying the cost of ocean freight. We may also sell coal to international customers delivered to an unloading facility at the destination country. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We own a 22% interest in Dominion Terminal Associates, a partnership that operates a ground storage-to-vessel coal transloading facility in Newport News, Virginia. The facility has a rated throughput capacity of 20 million tons of coal per year and ground storage capacity of approximately 1.7 million tons. The facility serves international customers, as well as domestic coal users located along the Atlantic coast of the United States. 

&#160; 

We also own a 38% interest in Millennium Bulk Terminals-Longview, LLC (MBT), the owner of a bulk commodity terminal on the Columbia River near Longview, Washington. MBT is currently working to obtain the required approvals and necessary permits to complete upgrades to enable coal shipments through the brownfield terminal. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The coal industry is intensely competitive. The most important factors on which we compete are coal quality, delivered costs to the customer and reliability of supply. Our principal domestic competitors include Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., Cloud Peak Energy, CONSOL Energy Inc. and Peabody Energy Corp. Some of these coal producers are larger than we are and have greater financial resources and larger reserve bases than we do. We also compete directly with a number of smaller producers in each of the geographic regions in which we operate, as well as companies that produce coal from one or more foreign countries, such as Australia, Colombia, Indonesia and South Africa. 

&#160; 

Additionally, coal competes with other fuels, such as natural gas, nuclear energy, hydropower, wind, solar and petroleum, for steam and electrical power generation. Costs and other factors relating to these alternative fuels, such as safety and environmental considerations, affect the overall demand for coal as a fuel. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

Principal supplies used in our business include petroleum-based fuels, explosives, tires, steel and other raw materials as well as spare parts and other consumables used in the mining process. We use third-party suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs, drilling services and construction. We use sole source suppliers for certain parts of our business such as explosives and fuel, and preferred suppliers for other parts of our business such as dragline and shovel parts and related services. We believe adequate substitute suppliers are available. For more information about our suppliers, you should see Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors-Increases in the costs of mining and other industrial supplies, including steel-based supplies, diesel fuel and rubber tires, or the inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of those supplies, could negatively affect our operating costs or disrupt or delay our production.&#148; 

&#160; 

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Federal, state and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety and the environment, including the protection of air quality, water quality, wetlands, special status species of plants and animals, land uses, cultural and historic properties and other environmental resources identified during the permitting process. Reclamation is required during production and after mining has been completed. Materials used and generated by mining operations must also be managed according to applicable regulations and law. These laws have, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our production costs and our competitive position. 

&#160; 

We endeavor to conduct our mining operations in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, due in part to the extensive, comprehensive and changing regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations occur from time to time. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. While it is not possible to accurately quantify the expenditures we incur to maintain compliance with all applicable federal and state laws, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant. Federal and state mining laws and regulations require us to obtain surety bonds to guarantee performance or payment of certain long-term obligations, including mine closure and reclamation costs, federal and state workers&#146; compensation benefits, coal 

&#160; 

&#160; 

leases and other miscellaneous obligations. Compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for domestic coal producers. 

&#160; 

Future laws, regulations or orders, as well as future interpretations and more rigorous enforcement of existing laws, regulations or orders, may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs and delays, interruptions or a termination of operations, the extent to which we cannot predict. Future laws, regulations or orders may also cause coal to become a less attractive fuel source, thereby reducing coal&#146;s share of the market for fuels and other energy sources used to generate electricity. As a result, future laws, regulations or orders may adversely affect our mining operations, cost structure or our customers&#146; demand for coal. 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of the various federal and state environmental and similar regulations that have a material impact on our business: 

&#160; 

Mining Permits and Approvals. &#160; Numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations. When we apply for these permits and approvals, we may be required to prepare and present to federal, state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed production or processing of coal may have upon the environment. For example, in order to obtain a federal coal lease, an environmental impact statement must be prepared to assist the BLM in determining the potential environmental impact of lease issuance, including any collateral effects from the mining, transportation and burning of coal, which may in some cases include a review of impacts on climate change. The authorization, permitting and implementation requirements imposed by federal, state and local authorities may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of mining operations. In the states where we operate, the applicable laws and regulations also provide that a mining permit or modification can be delayed, refused or revoked if officers, directors, shareholders with specified interests or certain other affiliated entities with specified interests in the applicant or permittee have, or are affiliated with another entity that has, outstanding permit violations. Thus, past or ongoing violations of applicable laws and regulations could provide a basis to revoke existing permits and to deny the issuance of additional permits.

&#160; 

In order to obtain mining permits and approvals from federal and state regulatory authorities, mine operators must submit a reclamation plan for restoring, upon the completion of mining operations, the mined property to its prior condition or other authorized use. Typically, we submit the necessary permit applications several months or even years before we plan to begin mining a new area. Some of our required permits are becoming increasingly more difficult and expensive to obtain, and the application review processes are taking longer to complete and becoming increasingly subject to challenge, even after a permit has been issued. 

&#160; 

Under some circumstances, substantial fines and penalties, including revocation or suspension of mining permits, may be imposed under the laws described above. Monetary sanctions and, in severe circumstances, criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws. 

&#160; 

Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. &#160; The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, which we refer to as SMCRA, establishes mining, environmental protection, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of underground mining. Mining operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals from the Office of Surface Mining, which we refer to as OSM, or from the applicable state agency if the state agency has obtained regulatory primacy. A state agency may achieve primacy if the state regulatory agency develops a mining regulatory program that is no less stringent than the federal mining regulatory program under SMCRA. All states in which we conduct mining operations have achieved primacy and issue permits in lieu of OSM.

&#160; 

In 1999, a federal court in West Virginia ruled that the stream buffer zone rule issued under SMCRA prohibited most excess spoil fills. While the decision was later reversed on jurisdictional grounds, the extent to which the rule applied to fills was left unaddressed. On December 12, 2008, OSM finalized a rulemaking regarding the interpretation of the stream buffer zone provisions of SMCRA which confirmed that excess spoil from mining and refuse from coal preparation could be placed in permitted areas of a mine site that constitute waters of the United States. That rule, however, was subject to a challenge in federal court. In addition, on November 30, 2009, OSM announced that it would re-examine and reinterpret the regulations finalized eleven months earlier. On February 20, 2014, the federal court vacated the 2008 rule. On December 22, 2014, OSM 

&#160; 

&#160; 

published the final revisions to the stream buffer zone rule in the Federal Register. The revisions reinstate the previous version of the rule, but do not announce a new interpretation of the rule regarding the ability to construct excess spoil fills. We cannot predict how the regulations will be applied or how they may affect coal production, though there are reports that any reinterpretation of the prior version of the rule would be to restrict the ability to construct mining related structures in streams. Such an interpretation could curtail surface mining operations in and near streams-especially in central Appalachia. 

&#160; 

SMCRA permit provisions include a complex set of requirements which include, among other things, coal prospecting; mine plan development; topsoil or growth medium removal and replacement; selective handling of overburden materials; mine pit backfilling and grading; disposal of excess spoil; protection of the hydrologic balance; subsidence control for underground mines; surface runoff and drainage control; establishment of suitable post mining land uses; and revegetation. We begin the process of preparing a mining permit application by collecting baseline data to adequately characterize the pre-mining environmental conditions of the permit area. This work is typically conducted by third-party consultants with specialized expertise and includes surveys and/or assessments of the following: cultural and historical resources; geology; soils; vegetation; aquatic organisms; wildlife; potential for threatened, endangered or other special status species; surface and ground water hydrology; climatology; riverine and riparian habitat; and wetlands. The geologic data and information derived from the other surveys and/or assessments are used to develop the mining and reclamation plans presented in the permit application. The mining and reclamation plans address the provisions and performance standards of the state&#146;s equivalent SMCRA regulatory program, and are also used to support applications for other authorizations and/or permits required to conduct coal mining activities. Also included in the permit application is information used for documenting surface and mineral ownership, variance requests, access roads, bonding information, mining methods, mining phases, other agreements that may relate to coal, other minerals, oil and gas rights, water rights, permitted areas, and ownership and control information required to determine compliance with OSM&#146;s Applicant Violator System, including the mining and compliance history of officers, directors and principal owners of the entity. 

&#160; 

Once a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through an administrative completeness review and a thorough technical review. Also, before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or otherwise secure the performance of all reclamation obligations. After the application is submitted, a public notice or advertisement of the proposed permit is required to be given, which begins a notice period that is followed by a public comment period before a permit can be issued. It is not uncommon for a SMCRA mine permit application to take over a year to prepare, depending on the size and complexity of the mine, and anywhere from six months to two years or even longer for the permit to be issued. The variability in time frame required to prepare the application and issue the permit can be attributed primarily to the various regulatory authorities&#146; discretion in the handling of comments and objections relating to the project received from the general public and other agencies. Also, it is not uncommon for a permit to be delayed as a result of litigation related to the specific permit or another related company&#146;s permit. 

&#160; 

In addition to the bond requirement for an active or proposed permit, the Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which was created by SMCRA, requires a fee on all coal produced. The proceeds of the fee are used to restore mines closed or abandoned prior to SMCRA&#146;s adoption in 1977. The current fee is $0.28 per ton of coal produced from surface mines and $0.12 per ton of coal produced from underground mines. In 2015, we recorded $32.7 million of expense related to these reclamation fees. 

&#160; 

Surety Bonds. &#160; Mine operators are often required by federal and/or state laws, including SMCRA, to assure, usually through the use of surety bonds, payment of certain long-term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers&#146; compensation costs, coal leases and other miscellaneous obligations. Although surety bonds are usually noncancelable during their term, many of these bonds are renewable on an annual basis. Please see &#147;Failure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations and, therefore, our ability to mine or lease coal, and a loss or reduction in our ability to self-bond could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations,&#148; contained under the heading Risk Factors&#151;Risks related to Our Operations for a discussion of certain risks associated with our surety bonds.

&#160; 

The costs of these bonds have fluctuated in recent years while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become more unfavorable to mine operators. These changes in the terms of the bonds have been accompanied at times by a 

&#160; 

&#160; 

decrease in the number of companies willing to issue surety bonds. In order to address some of these uncertainties, we use self-bonding to secure performance of certain obligations in Wyoming. As of December 31, 2015, we have self-bonded an aggregate of approximately $485.5 million, posted an aggregate of approximately $188.0 million in surety bonds for reclamation purposes and secured $49.2 million in letters of credit and cash for reclamation bonding obligations. In addition, we had approximately $212.0 million of surety bonds, cash and letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2015 to secure workers&#146; compensation, coal lease and other obligations. 

&#160; 

For additional information, please see &#147;Failure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations, and, therefore, our ability to mine or lease coal, and a loss or reduction in our ability to self-bond could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations,&#148; contained in Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risk Related to Our Operations,&#148; for a discussion of certain risks associated with our surety bonds. 

&#160; 

Mine Safety and Health. &#160; Stringent safety and health standards have been imposed by federal legislation since Congress adopted the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969. The Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 significantly expanded the enforcement of safety and health standards and imposed comprehensive safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations. In addition to federal regulatory programs, all of the states in which we operate also have programs aimed at improving mine safety and health. Collectively, federal and state safety and health regulation in the coal mining industry is among the most comprehensive and pervasive systems for the protection of employee health and safety affecting any segment of U.S. industry. In reaction to recent mine accidents, federal and state legislatures and regulatory authorities have increased scrutiny of mine safety matters and passed more stringent laws governing mining. For example, in 2006, Congress enacted the MINER Act. The MINER Act imposes additional obligations on coal operators including, among other things, the following:

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; development of new emergency response plans that address post-accident communications, tracking of miners, breathable air, lifelines, training and communication with local emergency response personnel;

&#183; &#160; establishment of additional requirements for mine rescue teams;

&#183; &#160; notification of federal authorities in the event of certain events;

&#183; &#160; increased penalties for violations of the applicable federal laws and regulations; and

&#183; &#160; requirement that standards be implemented regarding the manner in which closed areas of underground mines are sealed.

&#160; 

In 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives approved additional federal legislation which would have required new regulations on a variety of mine safety issues such as underground refuges, mine ventilation and communication systems. Although the U.S. Senate failed to pass that legislation, it is possible that similar legislation may be proposed in the future. Various states, including West Virginia, have also enacted laws to address many of the same subjects. The costs of implementing these safety and health regulations at the federal and state level have been, and will continue to be, substantial. In addition to the cost of implementation, there are increased penalties for violations which may also be substantial. Expanded enforcement has resulted in a proliferation of litigation regarding citations and orders issued as a result of the regulations. 

&#160; 

Under the Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, each coal mine operator must secure payment of federal black lung benefits to claimants who are current and former employees and to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. The trust fund is funded by an excise tax on production of up to $1.10 per ton for coal mined in underground operations and up to $0.55 per ton for coal mined in surface operations. These amounts may not exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price. This excise tax does not apply to coal shipped outside the United States. In 2015, we recorded $66.1 million of expense related to this excise tax. 

&#160; 

Clean Air Act. &#160; The federal Clean Air Act and similar state and local laws that regulate air emissions affect coal mining directly and indirectly. Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations include Clean Air Act permitting requirements and emissions control requirements relating to particulate matter which may include controlling fugitive dust. The Clean Air Act also indirectly affects coal mining operations, for example, by extensively regulating the emissions of fine particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds

&#160; 

&#160; 

emitted by coal-fueled power plants and industrial boilers, which are the largest end-users of our coal. Continued tightening of the already stringent regulation of emissions is likely, such as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS), finalized in 2011 and discussed in more detail below. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which we refer to as EPA, has issued regulations on additional emissions, such as greenhouse gases (GHG), from new, modified, reconstructed and existing electric generating units, including coal-fired plants. Other GHG regulations apply to industrial boilers (see discussion of Climate Change, below). These regulations could eventually reduce the demand for coal. 

&#160; 

Clean Air Act requirements that may directly or indirectly affect our operations include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Acid Rain. Title IV of the Clean Air Act, promulgated in 1990, imposed a two-phase reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities. Phase II became effective in 2000 and applies to all coal-fueled power plants with a capacity of more than 25-megawatts. Generally, the affected power plants have sought to comply with these requirements by switching to lower sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices, reducing electricity generating levels or purchasing or trading sulfur dioxide emissions allowances. Although we cannot accurately predict the future effect of this Clean Air Act provision on our operations, we believe that implementation of Phase II has been factored into the pricing of the coal market.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Particulate Matter. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards, which we refer to as NAAQS, for certain pollutants associated with the combustion of coal, including sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and ozone. Areas that are not in compliance with these standards, referred to as non-attainment areas, must take steps to reduce emissions levels. For example, NAAQS currently exist for particulate matter measuring 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller (PM10) and for fine particulate matter measuring 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller (PM2.5), and the EPA revised the PM2.5 NAAQS on December 14, 2012, making it more stringent. The states were required to make recommendations on nonattainment designations for the new NAAQS in late 2013. EPA issued final designations for most areas of the country in 2012 and made some revisions in 2015. Individual states must now identify the sources of emissions and develop emission reduction plans. These plans may be state-specific or regional in scope. Under the Clean Air Act, individual states have up to 12 years from the date of designation to secure emissions reductions from sources contributing to the problem. Future regulation and enforcement of the new PM2.5 standard, as well as future revisions of PM standards, will affect many power plants, especially coal-fueled power plants, and all plants in non-attainment areas.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Ozone. On October 26, 2015, the EPA published a final rule revising the existing primary and secondary NAAQS for ozone, reducing them to 70ppb on an 8-hour average. EPA has yet to make attainment designations for states on this new standard, but significant additional emission control expenditures will likely be required at certain coal-fueled power plants to meet the new stricter NAAQS. Nitrogen oxides, which are a byproduct of coal combustion, are classified as an ozone precursor. As a result, emissions control requirements for new and expanded coal-fueled power plants and industrial boilers will continue to become more demanding in the years ahead. The new standard is subject to pending judicial challenge.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; NOx SIP Call. The Nitrogen Oxides State Implementation Plan (NOx SIP) Call program was established by the EPA in October 1998 to reduce the transport of ozone on prevailing winds from the Midwest and South to states in the Northeast, which said that they could not meet federal air quality standards because of migrating pollution. The program was designed to reduce nitrous oxide emissions by one million tons per year in 22 eastern states and the District of Columbia. Phase II reductions were required by May 2007. As a result of the program, many power plants were required to install additional emission control measures, such as selective catalytic reduction devices. Installation of additional emission control measures has made it more costly to operate coal-fueled power plants, which could make coal a less attractive fuel.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Interstate Transport. The EPA finalized the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which we refer to as CAIR, in March 2005. CAIR called for power plants in 28 Eastern states and the District of Columbia to reduce emission levels of sulfur

&#160; 

&#160; 

dioxide and nitrous oxide, which could lead to non-attainment of PM2.5 and ozone NAAQS in downwind states (interstate transport), pursuant to a cap and trade program similar to the system now in effect for acid deposition control. In July 2008, in State of North Carolina v. EPA and consolidated cases, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed with the EPA&#146;s reading of the Clean Air Act and vacated CAIR in its entirety. In December 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit revised its remedy and remanded the rule to the EPA. The EPA proposed a revised transport rule on August 2, 2010 (75 Fed. Reg. 45209) to address attainment of the 1997 ozone NAAQS and the 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS. The rule was finalized as the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) on July 6, 2011, with compliance required for SO2 reductions beginning January 1, 2012 and compliance with NOx reductions required by May 1, 2012. Numerous appeals of the rule were filed and, on August 21, 2012, the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the rule, leaving the EPA to continue implementation of the CAIR. Controls required under the CAIR, especially in conjunction with other rules may have affected the market for coal inasmuch as multiple existing coal fired units were being retired rather than having required controls installed. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the EPA&#146;s appeal of the decision vacating CSAPR and on April 29, 2014, issued an opinion reversing the August 21, 2012 District of Columbia Circuit decision, remanding the case back to the District of Columbia Circuit. The EPA then requested that the court lift the CSAPR stay and toll the CSAPR compliance deadlines by three years. On October 23, 2014, the District of Columbia Circuit granted the EPA&#146;s request, and that court later dismissed all pending challenges to the rule on July 28, 2015 but it remanded some state budgets to EPA for further consideration. CSAPR Phase 1 implementation began in 2015, with Phase 2 beginning in 2017. CSAPR generally requires greater reductions that under CAIR. As a result, some coal-fired power plants will be required to install costly pollution controls or shut down which may adversely affect the demand for coal. Finally, in November 2015, EPA proposed an update to the CSAPR to address interstate transport of air pollution under the more recent 2008 ozone NAAQS and the state budgets remanded by the D.C. Circuit. EPA received public comment on the rule in January 2016 and will issue a final rule in the near future. It is likely the final rule will increase the pressure to install controls or shut down units, which may further adversely affect the demand for coal. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Mercury. In February 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the EPA&#146;s Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) and remanded it to the EPA for reconsideration. In response, the EPA announced an Electric Generating Unit (EGU) Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) on December 16, 2011. The MATS was finalized April 16, 2012, and required compliance for most plants by 2015. In addition, before the court decision vacating the CAMR, some states had either adopted the CAMR or adopted state-specific rules to regulate mercury emissions from power plants that are more stringent than the CAMR. MATS compliance, coupled with state mercury and air toxics laws and other factors have required many plants to install costly controls, re-fire with natural gas or to retire, which may adversely affect the demand for coal. MATS was challenged in the D.C. Circuit, which upheld the rule on April 15, 2013. Petitioners successfully obtained Supreme Court review, and on June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision striking down the final rule based on EPA&#146;s failure to consider economic costs in determining whether to regulate. The case was remanded to the D.C. Circuit. EPA began reconsideration of costs, proposing to re-issue the final rule in April 2016 based on a finding that those costs still justified regulation, and successfully secured an order from the D.C. Circuit to keep the rule in effect while it completed its rulemaking. Petitioners unsuccessfully sought a stay of the rule in the Supreme Court in February 2016. Therefore, the rule remains in effect until further order of the D.C. Circuit, which will likely hear challenges to EPA&#146;s re-issuance of the rule based on its new cost considerations. Hence, MATS will likely continue to impact coal-fueled generation as discussed above for at least the near term, and possibly well into the future.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Regional Haze. The EPA has initiated a regional haze program designed to protect and improve visibility at and around national parks, national wilderness areas and international parks, particularly those located in the southwest and southeast United States. Under the Regional Haze Rule, affected states were required to submit regional haze SIPs by December 17, 2007, that, among other things, were to identify facilities that would have to reduce emissions and comply with stricter emission limitations. The vast majority of states failed to submit their

&#160; 

&#160; 

plans by December 17, 2007, and the EPA issued a Finding of Failure to Submit plans on January 15, 2009 (74 Fed. Reg. 2392). The EPA had taken no enforcement action against states to finalize implementation plans and was slowly dealing with the state Regional Haze SIPs that were submitted, which resulted in the National Parks Conservation Association commencing litigation in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on August 3, 2012, against the EPA for failure to enforce the rule (National Parks Conservation Act v. EPA, D.C. Cir) . Industry groups, including the Utility Air Regulatory Group have intervened (Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA. D.C. Cir 12 - 1342, 8/6/2012 ). EPA ultimately agreed in a consent decree with environmental groups to impose regional haze federal implementation plans (FIPs) or to take action on regional haze SIPs before the agency for 42 states and the District of Columbia. EPA has completed those actions for all but several states in its first planning period (2008-2010). In many eastern states, EPA has allowed states to meet &#147;best available control technology&#148; (BART) requirements for power plants through compliance with CAIR and CSAPR (a policy under pending litigation). Other states have had BART imposed on a case-by-case basis, and where EPA found SIPs deficient, it disapproved them and issued FIPs. It is possible that EPA may continue to increase the stringency of control requirements imposed under the Regina Haze Program as it moves toward the next planning period. This program may result in additional emissions restrictions from new coal-fueled power plants whose operations may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas. This program may also require certain existing coal-fueled power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic chemicals and particulate matter. These limitations could affect the future market for coal. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; New Source Review. A number of pending regulatory changes and court actions are affecting the scope of the EPA&#146;s new source review program, which under certain circumstances requires existing coal-fueled power plants to install the more stringent air emissions control equipment required of new plants. The new source review program is continually revised and such revisions may impact demand for coal nationally, but we are unable to predict the magnitude of the impact.

&#160; 

Climate Change. &#160; Carbon dioxide, which is considered to be a greenhouse gas, is a by-product of burning coal. Global climate issues, including with respect to greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and the relationship that greenhouse gases may have with perceived global warning, continue to attract significant public and scientific attention. For example, the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have expressed concern about the impacts of human activity, especially from fossil fuel combustion, on global climate issues. As a result of the public and scientific attention, several governmental bodies increasingly are focusing on global climate issues and, more specifically, levels of emissions of carbon dioxide from coal combustion by power plants. Future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States could occur pursuant to future U.S. treaty obligations, statutory or regulatory changes and the federal, state or local level or otherwise.

&#160; 

Demand for coal also may be impacted by international efforts to reduce emissions from greenhouse gases. For example, in December 2015, representatives of 195 nations reached a landmark climate accord that will, for the first time, commit participating countries to lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Further, the United States and a number of international development banks, such as the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, have announced that they will no longer provide financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants, subject to very narrow exceptions. 

&#160; 

Although the U.S. Congress has considered various legislative proposals that would address global climate issues and greenhouse gas emissions, no such federal proposals have been adopted into law to date. In the absence of U.S. federal legislation on these topics, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the &#147;EPA&#148;) has been the primary source of federal oversight, although future regulation of greenhouse gases and global climate matters in the United States could occur pursuant to future U.S. treaty obligations, statutory or regulatory changes under the Clean Air Act, federal adoption of a greenhouse gas regulatory scheme or otherwise. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles and can decide against regulation only if the EPA determines that carbon dioxide does not significantly contribute to climate change and does not endanger public health or the environment. Although the Supreme Court&#146;s holding did not expressly involve the EPA&#146;s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, such as coal-fueled power plants, the EPA since has determined on its own that it has the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, and the EPA has published a formal determination that six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, endanger both the public health and welfare of current and future generations. 

&#160; 

In 2014, the EPA proposed a sweeping rule, known as the &#147;Clean Power Plan,&#148; to cut carbon emissions from existing electric generating units, including coal-fired power plants. A final version of the Clean Power Plan was adopted in August 2015. The final version of the Clean Power Plan aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electrical power generation by 32% within 15 years relative to 2005 levels through reduction of emissions from coal-burning power plants and increased use of renewable energy and energy conservation methods. Under the Clean Power Plan, states are free to reduce emissions by various means and must submit emissions reduction plans to the EPA by September 2016 or, with an approved extension, September 2018. If a state has not submitted a plan by then, the Clean Power Plan authorizes the EPA to impose its own plan on that state. In order to determine a state&#146;s goal, the EPA has divided the country into three regions based on connected regional electricity grids. States are to implement their plans by focusing on (i) increasing the generation efficiency of existing fossil fuel plants, (ii) substituting lower carbon dioxide emitting natural gas generation for coal-powered generation and (iii) substituting generation from new zero carbon dioxide emitting renewable sources for fossil fuel powered generation. States are permitted to use regionally available low carbon generation sources when substituting for in-state coal generation and coordinate with other states to develop multi-state plans. Following the adoption, 27 states sued the EPA, claiming that the EPA overstepped its legal authority in adopting the Clean Power Plan. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the EPA to halt enforcement of the Clean Power Plan until a lower court rules on the lawsuit and until the Supreme Court determines whether or not to hear the case. If the Supreme Court does decide to hear the case, then the stay would remain in effect until the Supreme Court rules. If the Clean Power Plan ultimately is upheld in its current form, it is projected to significantly curtail the construction of new coal-fired power plants and have a materially adverse impact on the demand for coal nationally. 

&#160; 

Several U.S. states have enacted legislation establishing greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals or requirements or joined regional greenhouse gas reduction initiatives. Some states also have enacted legislation or regulations requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power or that provide financial incentives to electricity suppliers for using renewable energy sources. For example, nine northeastern states currently are members of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is a mandatory cap-and-trade program established in 2005 to cap regional carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Six midwestern states and one Canadian province entered into the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord to establish voluntary regional greenhouse gas reduction targets and develop a voluntary multi-sector cap-and-trade system to help meet the targets, although it has been reported that the members no longer are actively pursuing the group&#146;s activities. Lastly, California and Quebec remain members of the Western Climate Initiative, which was formed in 2008 to establish a voluntary regional greenhouse gas reduction goal and develop market-based strategies to achieve emissions reductions, and those two jurisdictions have adopted their own greenhouse gas cap-and-trade regulations. Several states and provinces that originally were members of these organizations, as well as some current members, have joined the new North America 2050 initiative, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create economic opportunities aside from cap-and-trade programs. Any particular state, or any of these or other regional group, may have or adopt in the future rules or policies that cause some users of coal to switch from coal to a lower carbon fuel. There can be no assurance at this time that a carbon dioxide cap-and-trade-program, a carbon tax or other regulatory or policy regime, if implemented by any one or more states or regions in which our customers operate or at the federal level, will not affect the future market for coal in those states or regions and lower the overall demand for coal. 

&#160; 

Clean Water Act. &#160; The federal Clean Water Act (sometimes shortened to CWA) and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by restricting the discharge of pollutants, including dredged and fill materials, into waters of the United States. The Clean Water Act provisions and associated state and federal regulations are complex and subject to amendments, legal challenges and changes in implementation. Recent court decisions and regulatory actions have

&#160; 

&#160; 

created uncertainty over Clean Water Act jurisdiction and permitting requirements that could variously increase or decrease the cost and time we expend on Clean Water Act compliance. 

&#160; 

Clean Water Act requirements that may directly or indirectly affect our operations include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Water Discharge. Section 402 of the Clean Water Act creates a process for establishing effluent limitations for discharges to streams that are protective of water quality standards through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, which we refer to as the NPDES, or an equally stringent program delegated to a state regulatory agency. Regular monitoring, reporting and compliance with performance standards are preconditions for the issuance and renewal of NPDES permits that govern discharges into waters of the United States, especially on selenium, sulfate and specific conductance. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant penalties, compliance costs and delays in coal production. In addition, the imposition of future restrictions on the discharge of certain pollutants into waters of the United States could increase the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, which could impose additional time and cost burdens on our operations. You should see Item 3, &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; for more information about certain regulatory actions pertaining to our operations. Discharges of pollutants into waters that states have designated as impaired (i.e., as not meeting present water quality standards) are subject to Total Maximum Daily Load, which we refer to as TMDL, regulations. The TMDL regulations establish a process for calculating the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive while maintaining state water quality standards. Pollutant loads are allocated among the various sources that discharge pollutants into that water body. Mine operations that discharge into water bodies designated as impaired will be required to meet new TMDL allocations. The adoption of more stringent TMDL-related allocations for our coal mines could require more costly water treatment and could adversely affect our coal production.

&#160; 

The Clean Water Act also requires states to develop anti-degradation policies to ensure that non-impaired water bodies continue to meet water quality standards. The issuance and renewal of permits for the discharge of pollutants to waters that have been designated as &#147;high quality&#148; are subject to anti-degradation review that may increase the costs, time and difficulty associated with obtaining and complying with NPDES permits. 

&#160; 

Under the Clean Water Act, citizens may sue to enforce NPDES permit requirements. Beginning in 2012, multiple citizens&#146; suits were filed in West Virginia against mine operators for alleged violations of NPDES permit conditions requiring compliance with West Virginia&#146;s water quality standards. Some of the lawsuits alleged violations of water quality standards for selenium, whereas others alleged that discharges of conductivity and sulfate were causing violations of West Virginia water quality standards that prohibit adverse effects to aquatic life. The suits sought penalties as well as injunctive relief that would limit future discharges of selenium, conductivity or sulfate through the implementation of expensive treatment technologies. In 2012, the federal district court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted summary judgment to citizens in one such suit alleging violations of the water quality standard for selenium. In 2014, the same court found in another such suit that discharges of conductivity from two West Virginia mines were causing violations of West Virginia&#146;s narrative water quality standards. Both cases were resolved prior to any appeal and it is difficult to predict whether such suits will continue to be successful. 

&#160; 

Citizens may also sue under the Clean Water Act when pollutants are being discharged without NPDES permits. Beginning in 2013, multiple citizens&#146; suits were filed in West Virginia against landowners alleging ongoing discharges of pollutants, including selenium and conductivity, from valley fills at reclaimed mining sites. In each case, the reclamation bond had been released and the mining and NPDES permits had been terminated following the completion of reclamation. While it is difficult to predict the outcome of such suits, any determination that discharges from valley fills require NPDES permits could result in increased compliance costs following the completion of mining at our operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Dredge and Fill Permits. Many mining activities, such as the development of refuse impoundments, fresh water impoundments, refuse fills, valley fills, and other similar structures, may result in impacts to waters of the United States, including wetlands, streams and, in certain instances, man-made conveyances that have a hydrologic connection to such streams or wetlands. Under the Clean Water Act, coal companies are required to obtain a Section 404 permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, which we refer to as the Corps, prior to conducting such mining activities. The Corps is authorized to issue general &#147;nationwide&#148; permits for specific categories of activities that are similar in nature and that are determined to have minimal adverse effects on the environment. Permits issued pursuant to Nationwide Permit 21, which we refer to as NWP 21, generally authorize the disposal of dredged and fill material from surface coal mining activities into waters of the United States, subject to certain restrictions. Since March 2007, permits under NWP 21 were reissued for a five-year period with new provisions intended to strengthen environmental protections. There must be appropriate mitigation in accordance with nationwide general permit conditions rather than less restricted state-required mitigation requirements, and permit holders must receive explicit authorization from the Corps before proceeding with proposed mining activities. Notwithstanding the additional environmental protections designed in the NWP 21, on July 15, 2009, the Corps proposed to immediately suspend the use of NWP 21 in six Appalachian states, including West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia where the Company conducts operations. On June 17, 2010, the Corps announced that it had suspended the use of NWP 21 in the same six states although it remained for use elsewhere. In February 2012, the Corps proposed to reissue NWP 21, albeit with significant restrictions on the acreage and length of stream channel that can be filled in the course of mining operations. The Corps&#146; decisions regarding the use of NWP 21 does not prevent the Company&#146;s operations from seeking an individual permit under &#167; 404 of the CWA, nor does it restrict an operation from utilizing another version of the nationwide permit, NWP 50, authorized for small underground coal mines that must construct fills as part of their mining operations.

&#160; 

The use of nationwide permits to authorize stream impacts from mining activities has been the subject of significant litigation. Refer to Item 3, &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; for more information about certain litigation pertaining to our permits. 

&#160; 

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. &#160; The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which we refer to as RCRA, may affect coal mining operations through its requirements for the management, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Currently, certain coal mine wastes, such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes, are exempted from hazardous waste management. In addition, Subtitle C of RCRA exempted fossil fuel combustion wastes from hazardous waste regulation until the EPA completed a report to Congress and made a determination on whether the wastes should be regulated as hazardous. In its 1993 regulatory determination, the EPA addressed some high volume-low toxicity coal combustion products generated at electric utility and independent power producing facilities, such as coal ash, and left the exemption in place. In May 2000, the EPA concluded that coal combustion products do not warrant regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and again retained the hazardous waste exemption for these wastes. The EPA also determined that national non-hazardous waste regulations under RCRA Subtitle D are needed for coal combustion products disposed in surface impoundments and landfills and used as mine-fill. In March of 2007 the Office of Surface Mining and the EPA proposed regulations regarding the management of coal combustion products. The EPA concluded that beneficial uses of these wastes, other than for mine-filling, pose no significant risk and no additional national regulations are needed. As long as this exemption remains in effect, it is not anticipated that regulation of coal combustion waste will have any material effect on the amount of coal used by electricity generators. A final rule has not been promulgated. Most state hazardous waste laws also exempt coal combustion products, and instead treat it as either a solid waste or a special waste. Any costs associated with handling or disposal of hazardous wastes would increase our customers&#146; operating costs and potentially reduce their ability to purchase coal. In addition, contamination caused by the past disposal of ash can lead to material liability. In another development regarding coal combustion wastes, the EPA conducted an assessment of impoundments and other units that manage residuals from coal combustion and that contain free liquids following a massive coal ash spill in Tennessee in 2008, the EPA contractors conducted site assessments at many impoundments and is requiring appropriate remedial action at any facility that is found to have a unit posing a risk for potential failure. The EPA is posting utility responses to the assessment on its web site as the responses are received. Future regulations resulting from the EPA coal combustion refuse assessments may impact the ability of the Company&#146;s utility customers to continue to use coal in their power plants.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. &#160; The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which we refer to as CERCLA, and similar state laws affect coal mining operations by, among other things, imposing cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances that may endanger public health or welfare or the environment. Under CERCLA and similar state laws, joint and several liability may be imposed on waste generators, site owners and lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. Although the EPA excludes most wastes generated by coal mining and processing operations from the hazardous waste laws, such wastes can, in certain circumstances, constitute hazardous substances for the purposes of CERCLA. In addition, the disposal, release or spilling of some products used by coal companies in operations, such as chemicals, could trigger the liability provisions of the statute. Thus, coal mines that we currently own or have previously owned or operated, and sites to which we sent waste materials, may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws. In particular, we may be liable under CERCLA or similar state laws for the cleanup of hazardous substance contamination at sites where we own surface rights.

&#160; 

Endangered Species. &#160; The Endangered Species Act and other related federal and state statutes protect species threatened or endangered with possible extinction. Protection of threatened, endangered and other special status species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits and may include restrictions on timber harvesting, road building and other mining or agricultural activities in areas containing the affected species. A number of species indigenous to our properties are protected under the Endangered Species Act or other related laws or regulations. Based on the species that have been identified to date and the current application of applicable laws and regulations, however, we do not believe there are any species protected under the Endangered Species Act that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal from our properties in accordance with current mining plans. We have been able to continue our operations within the existing spatial, temporal and other restrictions associated with special status species. Should more stringent protective measures be applied to threatened, endangered or other special status species or to their critical habitat, then we could experience increased operating costs or difficulty in obtaining future mining permits.

&#160; 

Use of Explosives. &#160; Our surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting activities. Pursuant to these regulations, we incur costs to design and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast surveys and blast monitoring. In addition, the storage of explosives is subject to strict regulatory requirements established by four different federal regulatory agencies. For example, pursuant to a rule issued by the Department of Homeland Security in 2007, facilities in possession of chemicals of interest, including ammonium nitrate at certain threshold levels, must complete a screening review in order to help determine whether there is a high level of security risk such that a security vulnerability assessment and site security plan will be required.

&#160; 

Other Environmental Laws. &#160; We are required to comply with numerous other federal, state and local environmental laws in addition to those previously discussed. These additional laws include, for example, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 4,655 full and part-time employees. We believe that our relations with all employees are good.

GLOSSARY OF SELECTED MINING TERMS 

&#160; 

Certain terms that we use in this document are specific to the coal mining industry and may be technical in nature. The following is a list of selected mining terms and the definitions we attribute to them. 

&#160; 

Assigned reserves 

&#160; 

Recoverable reserves designated for mining by a specific operation. 

Brown coal 

&#160; 

Coal of gross calorific value of less than 5700 kilocalories per kilogramme (kcal/kg), which includes lignite and sub-bituminous coal where lignite has a gross calorific value of less than 4165 kcal/kg and sub-bituminous coal has a gross calorific value between 4165 kcal/kg and 5700 kcal/kg. 

Btu 

&#160; 

A measure of the energy required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree of Fahrenheit. 

Compliance coal 

&#160; 

Coal which, when burned, emits 1.2 pounds or less of sulfur dioxide per million Btus, requiring no blending or other sulfur dioxide reduction technologies in order to comply with the requirements of the Clean Air Act. 

Continuous miner 

&#160; 

A machine used in underground mining to cut coal from the seam and load it onto conveyors or into shuttle cars in a continuous operation. 

Dragline 

&#160; 

A large machine used in surface mining to remove the overburden, or layers of earth and rock, covering a coal seam. The dragline has a large bucket, suspended by cables from the end of a long boom, which is able to scoop up large amounts of overburden as it is dragged across the excavation area and redeposit the overburden in another area. 

Hard coal 

&#160; 

Coal of gross calorific value greater than 5700 kcal/kg on an ashfree but moist basis and further disaggregated into anthracite, coking coal and other bituminous coal. 

Longwall mining 

&#160; 

One of two major underground coal mining methods, generally employing two rotating drums pulled mechanically back and forth across a long face of coal. 

Low-sulfur coal 

&#160; 

Coal which, when burned, emits 1.6 pounds or less of sulfur dioxide per million Btus. 

Preparation plant 

&#160; 

A facility used for crushing, sizing and washing coal to remove impurities and to prepare it for use by a particular customer. 

Probable reserves 

&#160; 

Reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. 

Proven reserves 

&#160; 

Reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. 

Reclamation 

&#160; 

The restoration of land and environmental values to a mining site after the coal is extracted. The process commonly includes &#147;recontouring&#148; or shaping the land to its approximate original appearance, restoring topsoil and planting native grass and ground covers. 

Recoverable reserves 

&#160; 

The amount of proven and probable reserves that can actually be recovered from the reserve base taking into account all mining and preparation losses involved in producing a saleable product using existing methods and under current law. 

Reserves 

&#160; 

That part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. 

Room-and-pillar mining 

&#160; 

One of two major underground coal mining methods, utilizing continuous miners creating a network of &#147;rooms&#148; within a coal seam, leaving behind &#147;pillars&#148; of coal used to support the roof of a mine. 

Unassigned reserves 

&#160; 

Recoverable reserves that have not yet been designated for mining by a specific operation.
