 ITEM 1. BUSINESS: 

&#160;

General Description of Business 

&#160;

The Lightstone REIT III is a Maryland corporation, formed on October 5, 2012, which intends to elect to qualify and be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2015. Through December 31, 2015, t he Company has acquired two wholly-owned hotels and it will continue to seek to acquire additional hotels and other commercial real estate assets primarily located in the United States. All such properties may be acquired and operated by the Company alone or jointly with another party. The Company may also originate or acquire mortgage loans secured by real estate. 

&#160;

The Lightstone REIT III is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (&#8220;UPREIT&#8221;), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;).

&#160;

Lightstone REIT III and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221; and the use of &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to the Lightstone REIT III, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 

&#160;

Offering and Structure 

&#160;

Our sponsor, David Lichtenstein (&#8220;Lichtenstein&#8221;), who does business through The Lightstone Group, LLC (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;) and majority owns the limited liability company of that name, is one of the largest private residential and commercial real estate owners and operators in the United States today, with a diversified portfolio of over 100 properties containing approximately 10,285 multifamily units, approximately 257,000 square feet of office space, 1.5 million square feet of industrial space, 25 hotels, and 3.3 million square feet of retail space. The residential, office, industrial, hotel and retail properties are located in 21 states. Based in New York, and supported by regional offices in New Jersey, Maryland and Illinois, our Sponsor employs approximately 383 staff and professionals. Our Sponsor has extensive experience in the areas of investment selection, underwriting, due diligence, portfolio management, asset management, property management, leasing, disposition, finance, accounting and investor relations.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC (the &#8220;Advisor&#8221;), which is majority owned by our Sponsor. Our Advisor, together with our board of directors (the &#8220;Board of Directors&#8221;), is and will continue to be primarily responsible for making investment decisions and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of The Lightstone Group, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner of the Advisor and the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP III LLC, which has subordinated participation interests in the Operating Partnership. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as the Company&#8217;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT III or the Operating Partnership.

&#160;

We do not have and will not have any employees that are not also employed by our Sponsor or its affiliates. We depend substantially on our Advisor, which generally has responsibility for our day-to-day operations. Under the terms of the advisory agreement, the Advisor also undertakes to use its reasonable best efforts to present to us investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives as adopted by our Board of Directors.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s registration statement on Form S-11 (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;), pursuant to which it is offering to sell up to 30,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (which may be referred to herein as &#8216;&#8216;shares of common stock&#8217;&#8217; or as &#8216;&#8216;Common Shares&#8217;&#8217;) for $10.00 per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts (the &#8220;Primary Offering&#8221;) (exclusive of 10,000,000 shares available pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the &#8220;DRIP&#8221;) at an initial purchase price of $9.50 per share) was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) under the Securities Act of 1933 on July 15, 2014. Since inception, the Company had received gross proceeds of $39.6 million from the sale of 4.0 million shares of its common stock (including $2.0 million in Common Shares at a purchase price of $9.00 per Common Share to an entity 100% owned by David Lichtenstein, who also owns a majority interest in the Company&#8217;s Sponsor.)

&#160;

The Company currently intends to sell shares of its common stock under the Offering until the earlier of the date on which all the shares are sold, or July 15, 2016, two years from the date the Offering was declared effective by the SEC. If we have not sold all of the shares within two years, we may continue our Primary Offering for an additional year until July 15, 2017. The Company reserves the right to reallocate the shares of common stock it is offering between the Primary offering and the DRIP. Additionally, the Offering may be terminated at any time.

&#160;

Orchard Securities, LLC (&#8220;Orchard Securities&#8221;) is the Dealer Manager of the Company&#8217;s Offering. Orchard Securities has a branch office that does business as &#8220;Lightstone Capital Markets&#8221; and focuses primarily on distributing interests in programs sponsored by our Sponsor.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Advisor owned 20,000 shares of common stock which were issued on December 24, 2012 for $200,000, or $10.00 per share.

&#160;

As of December 11, 2014, the Company had reached the minimum offering under its Offering by receiving subscriptions of its common shares, representing gross offering proceeds of more than $2.0 million, and effective December 11, 2014 investors were admitted as stockholders and the Operating Partnership commenced operations. Through December 31, 2015, cumulative gross offering proceeds of approximately $39.6 million were released to the Company. The Company invested the proceeds received from the Offering and the Advisor in the Operating Partnership, and as a result, held a 99% general partnership interest as of December 31, 2015 in the Operating Partnership&#8217;s common units.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s shares of common stock are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. The Company may seek to list its shares of common stock for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of its independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of its stockholders. The Company does not intend to list its shares of common stock at this time. The Company does not anticipate that there would be any market for its shares of common stock until they are listed for trading. In the event the Company does not begin the process of achieving a liquidity event prior to the eighth anniversary of the termination of our Offering, our charter requires either (a) an amendment to our charter to extend the deadline to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event, or (b) the holding of a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio. 

&#160;

&#160; Noncontrolling Interest &#8211; Partners of Operating Partnership 

&#160;

On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed $2,000 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. A limited partner has the right to convert operating partnership units into cash or, at the option of the Company, an equal number of common shares of the Company, as allowed by the limited partnership agreement.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Lightstone SLP III LLC (the &#8216;&#8216;Special Limited Partner&#8217;&#8217;), a Delaware limited liability company of which Mr. Lichtenstein is the majority owner, is a special limited partner in our Operating Partnership and has committed to make a significant equity investment in us of up to $36.0 million, which is equivalent to 12.0% of the $300.0 million maximum amount of our Offering. Specifically, the Special Limited Partner has committed to purchase subordinated participation interests in our Operating Partnership (the &#8220;Subordinated Participation Interests&#8221;) quarterly in an amount equal to the product of (i) $10.00 minus our then current estimated net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) per Common Share, multiplied by (ii) the number of our Common Shares outstanding. The Operating Partnership will issue one Subordinated Participation Interest for each $50,000 in cash or interests in real property of equivalent value that the Special Limited Partner contributes. We expect to first publish an estimated NAV per Common Share on or prior to April 11, 2016. The Special Limited Partner&#8217;s obligation will continue until the earlier of: (i) the termination of our Offering; (ii) the Special Limited Partner&#8217;s purchase of an aggregate of $36.0 million of Subordinated Participation Interests and (iii) our receipt of gross offering proceeds of $300.0 million. The Special Limited Partner may elect to purchase the Subordinated Participation Interests for cash or may contribute interests in real property of equivalent value. The Subordinated Participation Interests may be entitled to receive liquidation distributions upon our liquidation.

&#160;

On July 31, 2015, the Special Limited Partner purchased 14 Subordinated Participation Interests in consideration of $700,000, which was an offset to amounts that were recorded in due to related parties on our consolidated balance sheet. On January 12, 2016, the Special Limited Partner purchased an additional 26 Subordinated Participation Interests in consideration of a cash payment of $1.3 million.

&#160;

Operations - Operating Partnership Activity 

&#160; 

Our Operating Partnership commenced its operations on December 11, 2014. Since then we have and will continue to seek to primarily acquire and operate hospitality properties and to lesser extent, commercial and residential properties principally in North America through our Operating Partnership. Our commercial holdings will consist of full-service or select-service hotels, including extended-stay hotels and to a lesser extent, retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), industrial and office properties. All such properties may be acquired and operated by us alone or jointly with another party. In addition, we may invest up to 20% of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which it may acquire directly.

&#160;

The following summarizes our completed acquisitions through December 31, 2015:

&#160;

&#183; On February 4, 2015 we acquired a 120-room select service Hampton Inn Hotel (the &#8220;Hampton Inn &#8211; Des Moines&#8221;) located in Des Moines, Iowa; &#160;

&#183; On May 15, 2015 we acquired a 146-room select service Courtyard by Marriott Hotel (the &#8220;Courtyard - Durham&#8221;) located in Durham, North Carolina; &#160;

Related Parties 

&#160; 

Our Advisor and Property Managers are each related parties of the Company. Each of these entities have or will receive compensation and fees for services related to our offerings and will continue to receive compensation and fees and services for the investment and management of our assets. These entities have received and will receive fees during our offering, acquisition, operational and liquidation stages. The compensation levels during our offering, acquisition and operational stages are based on percentages of the offering proceeds sold, the cost of acquired properties and the annual revenue earned from such properties, and other such fees outlined in each of the respective agreements.

&#160;

Primary Business Objectives and Strategies &#160;

&#160;

Our primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk. We intend to achieve this goal primarily through investments in real estate properties. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our Offering to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of real estate investments.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Acquisition and Investment Policies 

&#160;

We primarily intend to acquire full-service or select-service hotels, including extended-stay hotels. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities including restaurants, concierge and room service, porter service or valet parking. Select-service hotels typically do not include these amenities. Extended-stay hotels offer upscale, high-quality, residential style lodging with a comprehensive package of guest services and amenities for extended-stay business and leisure travelers. We have no limitation as to the brand of franchise or license with which our hotels will be associated.

&#160;

Even though we intend primarily to acquire hotels, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds to purchase other types of real estate. We believe that at least 75% of the net proceeds raised in the Offering will be used to acquire hotels and the remaining portion of the net proceeds raised in the Offering will be used to acquire properties and real estate-related assets other than hotels. However, we may use more or less than 75% of the net proceeds raised in the Offering to acquire hotels and are not bound to that limit. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical office properties. We expect to invest a significant portion of our funds in direct real estate investments and other equity interests, and the remainder of our funds in debt interests, which may include bridge or mezzanine loans, including in furtherance of a loan-to-own strategy. However, we are not prohibited from investing all our funds in debt interests.

&#160;

We anticipate that our portfolio will provide consistent current income and may also provide capital appreciation resulting from our expectation that in certain circumstances we will be able to acquire properties at a discount to replacement cost or otherwise at less than what we perceive as the market value or to reposition or redevelop a property so as to increase its value over the amount of capital we deployed to acquire and rehabilitate the property. We may acquire properties that we believe would benefit from a change in management strategy, or that have incurred substantial deferred maintenance. We plan to diversify our portfolio by geographic region, investment size and investment risk with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of hotels and other income-producing real estate properties and real estate-related assets that provide attractive returns for our investors.

&#160;

Our advisor intends to focus on markets that may be depressed or overbuilt and on sellers who are distressed or time-constrained. Our opportunistic real estate strategy involves more risk than real estate programs that have a targeted holding period for investments longer than ours, utilize leverage to a lesser degree or employ more conservative investment strategies, and, based upon these factors and the experience of our sponsor, The Lightstone Group, we believe that we have a potential for a higher rate of return than comparable real estate programs. The exact markets that will ultimately be targeted by our advisor will depend on its evaluation of property prices and other economic considerations impacting the particular markets.

&#160;

As part of our opportunistic real estate investment strategy, we may acquire hotels with low occupancy rates and reposition them by seeking to improve the property and occupancy rates and thereby increase average daily rates, revenue per available room and overall property value. Further, we may invest in hotels that we believe present an opportunity for enhanced future value because of delayed renovations or deferred maintenance that we believe we can remedy.

&#160;

We intend to purchase properties that have been constructed and have operating histories; additionally, we may acquire properties that are newly constructed, under development or construction or not yet developed. Properties may include multifamily properties purchased for conversion into condominiums or cooperatives, ground leases and properties intended to be converted from one use to another use. Additionally, subject to applicable REIT requirements, as a property reaches a market value that would provide what our advisor believes to be an attractive return to our investors given the then prevailing market conditions, we will consider disposing of the property and may do so for the purpose of distributing the net sale proceeds to our stockholders. We anticipate that such dispositions typically would occur during the period from three to six years after the termination of the Offering. However, subject to provisions of the Code relating to &#8220;prohibited transactions,&#8221; we may consider investing in properties with a different anticipated holding period in the event such properties provide an opportunity for an attractive overall return. For example, we may acquire properties in markets that are depressed or overbuilt with the anticipation that, within our anticipated holding period, the markets will recover and favorably impact the value of these properties. In addition, we may acquire interests in other entities with similar real property investments or investment strategies. We expect to make our investments in real estate assets located in the United States and its territories, with an initial focus on the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest regions of the United States.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Subject to the applicable REIT requirements, to the extent that our advisor determines that it is advantageous, we may originate or invest in real estate-related assets such as mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans and debt and equity securities issued by other real estate companies. In each case, these real estate-related assets will have been identified as being opportunistic investments with significant possibilities for near-term capital appreciation or higher current income; however, we intend to limit these types of investments so that neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

&#160;

We may enter into one or more joint ventures, tenant-in-common investments or other co-ownership arrangements for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties with third parties or certain affiliates of our advisor, including other present and future REITs and real estate limited partnerships sponsored by affiliates of our advisor.

&#160;

Financing Strategy and Policies 

&#160;

We expect that once we have fully invested the proceeds of the Offering, assuming we sell the maximum amount, our portfolio-wide loan-to-value ratio (calculated after the close of the Offering) will be approximately 65%. For purposes of calculating our 65% target leverage, we will determine the loan-to-value ratio on our portfolio based on the greater of the aggregate cost and the fair market value of our investments and other assets. There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for the purchase of any single asset. Our charter allows us to incur leverage up to 300% of our total &#8220;net assets&#8221; (as defined in Section I.B of the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments. We may only exceed this 300% limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of this limit and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with a justification for the excess borrowing. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.

&#160;

We do not intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter after we have fully invested the proceeds of the Offering, although we anticipate exceeding the leverage limit in the early stages of our development when the costs of our investments are most likely to exceed our net offering proceeds. Careful use of debt will help us to achieve our diversification goals because we will have more funds available for investment. However, high levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors.

&#160;

Distribution Objectives 

&#160;

U.S. federal income tax law requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. In order to qualify or continue to qualify for REIT status, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available.

&#160;

Distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. We may fund distributions with cash proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock or borrowings if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund distributions. Our ability to pay regular distributions and the amount of distributions will depend upon a variety of factors. For example, our borrowing policy permits us to incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less, and we may have to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We cannot assure that regular distributions will continue to be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distributions that we have established or may establish.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We are an accrual basis taxpayer, and as such our REIT taxable income could be higher than the cash available to us. We may therefore borrow to make distributions, which could reduce the cash available to us, in order to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income as a condition to our election to be taxed as a REIT. These distributions made with borrowed funds may constitute a return of capital to stockholders. &#8220;Return of capital&#8221; refers to distributions to investors in excess of net income. To the extent that distributions to stockholders exceed earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although such distributions might not reduce stockholders&#8217; aggregate invested capital. Because our earnings and profits are reduced for depreciation and other non-cash items, it is likely that a portion of each distribution will constitute a tax-deferred return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

&#160;

On January 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized and we declared a distribution which is calculated based on stockholders of record each day during the applicable period at a rate of $0.00164383 per day, and equals a daily amount that, if paid each day for a 365-day period, would equal a 6.0% annualized rate based on a share price of $10.00. Our first distribution began to accrue on December 11, 2014 (date of breaking escrow) through February 28, 2015 (the end of the month following our initial property acquisition) and subsequent distributions were declared on a monthly basis thereafter. The first distribution was paid on March 15, 2015 and subsequent distributions have been paid by the 15th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business on the last day of the prior month. Our stockholders have an option to elect the receipt of Common Shares in lieu of cash distributions under our DRIP.

&#160;

Total distributions declared during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $1.0 million.

&#160;

Distribution Reinvestment and Share Repurchase Programs 

&#160;

Our DRIP provides our stockholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares of our common stock, at an initial purchase price of $9.50 per common share, which is a discount to our Offering price of $10.00 per common share, by reinvesting their distributions. In connection with our Offering, 10,000,000 Common Shares were reserved for issuance under our DRIP and as of December 31, 2015, 9,965,675 shares remained available for issuance.

&#160;

Our share repurchase program may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell their shares of common stock back to us, subject to restrictions. From our date of inception through December 31, 2015, we did not receive any requests to redeem shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program.

&#160;

Our Board of Directors reserves the right to terminate either program for any reason without cause by providing 10 days written notice of termination of the DRIP to all participants or written notice of termination of the share repurchase program to all stockholders.

&#160;

Tax Status 

&#160;

We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015 . If we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.

&#160;

We engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#34;TRSs&#34;). When we purchase a hotel we establish a TRS and enters into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, we may be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no material uncertain income tax positions. Additionally, even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

To qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries TRSs. As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The hotel and other commercial real estate markets are highly competitive. This competition could reduce occupancy levels and rental revenues at our properties, which would adversely affect our operations. We expect to face competition from many sources. We will face competition from other hotels both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where our hotels will be located. Overbuilding in the hotel industry will increase the number of rooms available and may decrease occupancy and room rates. In addition, increases in operating costs due to inflation may not be offset by increased room rates. We will also face competition from nationally recognized hotel brands with which we will not be associated.

&#160;

We will compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property&#8217;s design to prospective tenants&#8217; needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.

&#160;

In addition, we will compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to those sought by us. Therefore, we will compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.

&#160;

Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. In addition, competition for desirable investments could delay the investment of proceeds from our Offering in desirable assets, which may in turn reduce our earnings per share and negatively affect our ability to commence or maintain distributions to stockholders.

&#160;

We believe that our senior management&#8217;s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of properties and reputation in the industry will enable us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.

&#160;

Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we believe we are well positioned within the hospitality industry and any industries in which we may operate to offer existing property owners the opportunity to contribute their properties to us in tax-deferred transactions using our Operating Partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we believe we have a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.

&#160;

Environmental 

&#160;

As an owner of real estate, we will be subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

We do not have employees. We entered into an advisory agreement with our advisor pursuant to which our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate-related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We have and will continue to pay our Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we have and will continue to reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.

&#160;

Economic Dependence 

&#160;

We are dependent upon the net proceeds received from our Offering to conduct our proposed activities. The capital required to acquire real estate and real estate related investments will be obtained from the proceeds from our Offering and from any indebtedness that we may incur in connection with the acquisition of any real estate and real estate related investments thereafter.

&#160;
