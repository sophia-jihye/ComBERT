 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

&#160; 

History of the Business 

&#160; 

We are a development stage company that identified, evaluated and acquired oil and gas exploration and development opportunities primarily in the United States. As a result of the decline in the oil and gas markets, we are now seeking other strategic alternatives. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 25, 2008 as &#8220;Loran Connection Corp.&#8221; We were formed to provide a variety of services in the area of individual and group tourism and business support in Ukraine. We subsequently filed a resale registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 28, 2009, which was declared effective on October 28, 2009. On January 25, 2012, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation to, among other things, change our name to &#8220;PetroTerra Corp.&#8221; and effect a thirty-two-for-one reverse split. We changed our name to reflect a proposed change in our business operations. On October 2, 2013, in connection with a change of control in the management of the Company, the Company began its current business operations in the oil and gas sector. On December 18, 2013, we filed a certificate of change to effect a one-for-two reverse stock split of our authorized and our outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock. On April 12, 2014, we completed our acquisition of certain property leases (the &#8220;Leases&#8221;) held by Ardmore Investments Inc. (&#8220;Ardmore&#8221;) for property owned by Pioneer Oil and Gas (&#8220;Pioneer&#8221;) covering 5,905.54 acres of land located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah (the &#8220;Utah Properties&#8221;). Since January 2016, as a result of the decline in the oil and gas markets, we ceased investing in the Utah Properties and began seeking a strategic alternative both inside and outside of the oil and gas market. 

&#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located at 422 East Vermijo Avenue, Suite 313, Colorado Springs, CO 80903. The telephone number at our principal executive offices is (719) 219-6404. Our web site is www.petroterracorp.com. 

&#160; 

Our Business Plan 

&#160; 

The Company was an independent exploration and development company focused on the acquisition of property (or property leases enabling us to explore and exploit such property) that we believed may contain extractable oil and/or gas. 

&#160; 

On November 18, 2013, we entered into an assignment of lease agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) whereby Ardmore assigned to us its rights under a certain purchase agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;), dated August 8, 2013, between Ardmore and Pioneer involving the sale of 5,905.54 acres of three separate BLM Management oil and gas Leases located in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah and currently owned by Pioneer. Per the terms of the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore 250,000 shares of our common stock on November 18, 2013, and, in order to complete the assignment contemplated by the Agreement, we issued to Ardmore an additional 250,000 shares of our common stock upon the transfer to us of ownership in the Leases, which occurred on April 12, 2014. Furthermore, the Company made three installment payments of $100,000 each to Pioneer pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Leases were conveyed to the Company on April 10, 2014. 

&#160; 

In January 2014 we hired a third party independent contractor to provide insight and to assist in the development of a plan regarding the exploration of any properties that we acquire. In March 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to provide geologic consulting services to the Company. In March 2014 we also obtained an MHA Technical Report on the Utah Properties. In September 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to review and process both the public domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets that existed on our leased Utah Properties. In November 2014, we engaged a third party independent contractor to perform a comprehensive gravity survey on our Utah Properties which was completed in December 2014 and the results of such survey were interpreted in February 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On September 28, 2014, the Company engaged Thompson Solutions, LLC (&#8220;Thompson&#8221;) to review and process both the public domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets that existed on our leased Utah Properties. The purpose of this review was to identify major structures and geologic trends of interest on the Utah Properties. Based on the results of this analysis, on November 21, 2014, the Company engaged Magee Geophysical Services LLC (&#8220;Magee&#8221;) to perform a comprehensive gravity survey on our Utah Properties. The gravity survey was conducted from November 22, 2014 through December 9, 2014 and cost the Company approximately $55,000. Pursuant to the survey, a total of 737 new gravity stations were identified on a nominal quarter mile grid and the data acquired was merged with re-processed public domain data including about 630 stations located in and around the main grid. Upon completion of Magee&#8217;s gravity survey, on December 8, 2014, the Company engaged Thompson to further process the data obtained by Magee and to provide custom processing and mapping of such data. On February 6, 2015, Thompson completed their interpretation of the gravity survey. The Company will pay to Thompson $15,500 for its services. 

&#160; 

On February 2, 2015 the Company engaged PRISEM Geoscience Consulting LLC (&#8220;PRISEM&#8221;) to provide recommendations on a work plan for creating a geologic model of the Utah Properties. Due to the volatility of the oil and gas market, the geologic model was never completed. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Properties 

&#160; 

As described above, the Company holds oil and gas leases for property in Sevier and Beaver Counties, Utah. On April 10th 2014, we acquired the Leases pursuant to the Agreement. These three Leases cover 5,950.54 gross acres in Sevier and Beaver counties in southwest Utah. The two Sevier leases, UTU-89243 and UTU-89244, each have a term through 02/01/2023 (hereinafter, the &#8220;Sevier Prospect&#8221;). Our Beaver county lease, UTU-86466, has an expiration date of 02/01/2021 (hereinafter, the &#8220;Beaver Prospect&#8221; and together with the Sevier Prospect, the &#8220;Sevier and Beaver Oil Project&#8221;). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement which governs the terms under which we can use the Utah Properties, we have a 100% Working Interest (WI) and an 80% Net Revenue Interest (NRI) in the Leases. 

&#160; 

Oil and Gas Industry-Specific Disclosures 

&#160; 

As described above, the Company had only recently begun its oil and gas business operations before operations were halted in order to identify other strategic alternatives, not necessarily limited to the oil and gas industry. Accordingly, the disclosure required by Subpart 1200 of Regulation S-K (Section 229.1200 of this chapter) is not applicable to our Company as of the date hereof. The Company has obtained Leases in the Central Utah Thrust Belt in Beaver County and Sevier County, Utah consisting of 5,950.54 gross acres of undeveloped acreage. 

&#160; 

Current Business Plan 

&#160; 

Given the current climate in the oil and gas industry, on or about January 2016, management determined to cease development of our oil and gas leases and instead seek a strategic alternative, whether in the oil and gas industry or otherwise. 

&#160;
