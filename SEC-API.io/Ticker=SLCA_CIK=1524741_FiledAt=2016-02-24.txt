Adjusted EBITDA as used herein is a non-GAAP measure. For a detailed description of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, please see the discussion under &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; How We Evaluate Our Business &#8211; Adjusted EBITDA.&#8221; 

Our Company 

Business Overview 

We are one of the largest domestic producers of commercial silica, a specialized mineral that is a critical input into a variety of attractive end markets. During our 115 &#32;year history, we have developed core competencies in mining, processing, logistics and materials science that enable us to produce and cost-effectively deliver over 260 &#32;products to customers across these markets. Our operations are organized into two segments based on end markets served: (1) Oil &#38; Gas Proppants and (2) Industrial &#38; Specialty Products. In our largest end market, oil and gas proppants, our frac sand is used to stimulate and maintain the flow of hydrocarbons in oil and natural gas wells. Our silica is also used as an economically irreplaceable raw material in a wide range of industrial applications, including glassmaking and chemical manufacturing. Additionally, in recent years a number of attractive new end markets have developed for our high-margin, performance silica products, including high-performance glass, specialty coatings, polymer additives and geothermal energy systems. Our segments are complementary because our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across end markets allows us to maximize recovery rates in our mining operations, optimize our asset utilization and reduce the cyclicality of our earnings. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we operate 17 &#32;production facilities across the United States and control 400 million tons of reserves, including approximately 222 million tons of reserves that can be processed to meet the American Petroleum Institute (&#8220;API&#8221;) frac sand size specifications. We produce a wide range of frac sand sizes and are capable of rail delivery of large quantities of API grade frac sand to most of the major U.S. shale basins via our transload network. We believe that, due to a combination of these favorable attributes, we have become a preferred commercial silica supplier to our customers in the oil and gas proppants end market. 

Corporate History 

U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 14, 2008. U.S. Silica Company, which has been a domestic producer of commercial silica for 115 &#32;years, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on November 25, 2008. On January 31, 2012, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock. Simultaneously with the initial public offering of our common stock, GGC USS Holdings, LLC (&#8220;GGC Holdings&#8221;), our sole stockholder prior to the IPO, contributed to us all of the stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, GGC RCS Holdings, Inc., and its operating subsidiary, Coated Sand Solutions, LLC. Coated Sand Solutions, LLC, develops resin coated sand proppants for sale into the oil and gas proppants market for use in the hydraulic fracturing process and into the foundry market. GGC Holdings divested its full ownership interest in U.S. Silica in 2013. 

Our Strengths 

We attribute our success to the following strengths: 

&#8226; 

Large-scale producer with a diverse and high-quality reserve base . Our 17 &#32;geographically dispersed production facilities control 400 million &#32;tons of reserves, including API size frac sand and large quantities of silica with distinct characteristics, giving us the ability to sell over 260 &#32;products to customers in both our Oil &#38; Gas Proppants segment and Industrial &#38; Specialty Products segment. Our large-scale production and logistics capabilities and long reserve life make us a preferred commercial silica supplier to our customers. Our consistent, reliable supply of large quantities of silica gives our customers the security to customize their production processes around our commercial silica. Furthermore, our large scale provides us earnings diversification and a larger addressable market. 

&#8226; 

Geographically advantaged footprint with intrinsic transportation advantages. &#32;The strategic location of our facilities and our logistics capabilities enable us to enjoy high customer retention and a larger addressable market. In our Oil &#38; Gas Proppants segment, our network of frac sand production facilities with access to Class I rail either onsite or by truck and the strategic locations of our transloads serve to create an addressable market that includes every major U.S. shale basin. Additionally, in 2014, we acquired Cadre Services, Inc. ("Cadre"), a leading regional 

sand mining company based in Voca, Texas. This facility allows customers to ship directly to the wellheads in the Permian basin by truck, which provides us with a delivered cost advantage. We believe we are one of the few frac sand producers capable of cost-effectively delivering API grade frac sand to most of the major U.S. shale basins by on-site rail. Additionally, due to the high weight-to-value ratio of many silica products in our Industrial &#38; Specialty Products segment, the proximity of our facilities to our customers&#8217; facilities often results in us being their sole supplier. This advantage has enabled us to enjoy strong customer retention in this segment, with our top five Industrial &#38; Specialty Products segment customers purchasing from us for an average of over 50 years. 

&#8226; 

Low-cost operating structure. We focus on building and operating facilities with low delivered cost that will allow us to be successful through the cycle. We believe the combination of the following factors contributes to our low-cost structure and our high margins: 

&#8226; 

our ownership of the vast majority of our reserves, resulting in mineral royalty expense that was less than 0.2% &#32;of our sales in 2015 ; 

&#8226; 

the close proximity of our mines to their respective processing plants, which allows for a cost-efficient and highly automated production process; 

&#8226; 

our processing expertise, which enables us to create over 260 &#32;products with unique characteristics while minimizing waste; 

&#8226; 

our integrated logistics management expertise and geographically advantaged facility network, which enables us to reliably ship products by the most cost-effective method available, whether by truck, rail or barge; 

&#8226; 

our large customer base across numerous end markets, which allows us to maximize our mining recovery rate and asset utilization; and 

&#8226; 

our large overall and plant-level operating scale. 

&#8226; 

Strong reputation with our customers and the communities in which we operate. &#32; We believe that we have built a strong reputation during our 115 &#32;year operating history. Our customers know us for our dependability and our high-quality, innovative products, as we have a long track record of timely delivery of our products according to customer specifications. We also have an extensive network of technical resources, including materials science and petroleum engineering expertise, which enables us to collaborate with our customers to develop new products and improve the performance of their existing applications. We are also well known in the communities in which we operate as a preferred employer and a responsible corporate citizen, which generally serves us well in hiring new employees and securing difficult to obtain permits for expansions and new facilities. 

&#8226; 

Experienced management team . The members of our senior management team bring significant experience to the dynamic environment in which we operate. Their expertise covers a range of disciplines, including industry-specific operating and technical knowledge as well as experience managing high-growth businesses. We believe we have assembled a flexible, creative and responsive team that can quickly adapt to the rapidly evolving unconventional oil and natural gas drilling landscape. 

Our Business Strategy 

The key drivers of our growth strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Expand our Oil &#38; Gas Proppants &#32; production capacity and product portfolio. &#32; We continue to consider and execute several initiatives to increase our frac sand production capacity and augment our proppant product portfolio. 

&#8226; 

While we made various initial investments or initial evaluations of new Greenfield sites in recent years, these expansion projects have been given lower priority due to the current frac sand market conditions. Our current focus for expanding production capacity is on maximizing existing production facility efficiencies. 

&#8226; 

In order to increase our resin coated product portfolio, during 2015, we announced the introduction of InnoProp &#174; &#32;Python RCS, a new high-performance resin coated proppant designed to increase the production of oil and gas wells in an economical and efficient manner. In early 2016, we introduced another new resin coated product, InnoProp &#174; &#32;PLT, which is a curable low-temperature product and can be used without an activator in oil and gas wells that have bottom-hole static temperatures down to 70&#176;F. 

&#8226; 

Increase our presence and product offering in industrial and specialty products end markets. Our research and business development teams work in tandem with our customers to develop new products, which we expect will either increase our presence and market share in certain industrial and specialty products end markets or allow us to enter new markets. We manage a robust pipeline of new products in various stages of development. Some of these products have already come to market, resulting in a positive impact on our financial results. We continue to work 

toward offering more value-driven industrial and specialty products that will enhance the profitability of the business. 

&#8226; 

Optimize product mix and further develop value-added capabilities to maximize margins. &#32; We continue to actively manage our product mix at each of our plants to ensure we maximize our profit margins. This requires us to use our proprietary expertise in balancing key variables, such as mine geology, processing capacities, transportation availability, customer requirements and pricing. We expect to continue investing in ways to increase the value we provide to our customers by expanding our product offerings, improving our supply chain management, upgrading our information technology, and creating a world class customer service model. 

&#8226; 

Expand our supply chain network and leverage our logistics capabilities to meet our customers&#8217; needs in each strategic oil and gas basin. &#32; We continue to expand our transload network to ensure product is available to meet the in-basin needs of our customers. This approach allows us to provide strong customer service and puts us in a position to take advantage of opportunistic spot market sales. Our plant sites are strategically located to provide access to key Class I railroads, which enables us to cost effectively send product to each of the strategic basins in North America. We can ship product by truck, barge and rail with an ability to connect to short-line railroads as necessary to meet our customers&#8217; evolving in-basin product needs. We believe that our supply chain network and logistics capabilities are a competitive advantage that enables us to provide superior service for our customers. For example, in 2015 , we opened our Odessa, Texas unit train receiving transload facility which was built in partnership with Union Pacific Railroad to support mainly the Permian market. We expect to continue to make strategic investments and develop partnerships with transload operators and transportation providers that will enhance our portfolio of supply chain services that we can provide to customers. As of December 31, 2015 , we have storage capacity at 49 &#32;transloads located near all of the major shale basins in the United States. 

&#8226; 

Evaluate both Greenfield and Brownfield expansion opportunities and other acquisitions. &#32; We expect to continue leveraging our reputation, processing capabilities and infrastructure to increase production, as well as explore other opportunities to expand our reserve base. We may accomplish this by developing Greenfield projects, where we can capitalize on our technical knowledge of geology, mining and processing and our strong reputation within local communities. We are continuing to consider pursuing acquisitions to grow, by taking advantage of our asset footprint, our management&#8217;s experience with high-growth businesses, and our strong customer relationships. Our primary objective is to acquire assets with differing levels of frac sand qualities that are complementary to our Oil &#38; Gas Proppants segment, with a focus on mining, processing and logistics to further enhance our market presence. We prioritize acquisitions that provide opportunities to realize synergies (and, in some cases, the acquisition may be accretive assuming synergies), including entering new geographic and frac sand product markets, acquiring attractive customer contracts and improving operations. For instance, we completed the Cadre acquisition on July 31, 2014, which generated synergies and positively impacted our results of operations. We are in active discussions to acquire assets fitting this strategy, which, if completed, would be &#8220;significant&#8221; under Regulation S-X and could require additional sources of financing. There can be no assurance that we will reach a definitive agreement and complete any of these potential transactions. See the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I, including the risk factor entitled, &#8220;If we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Maintain financial strength and flexibility . We intend to maintain financial strength and flexibility to enable us to better manage through the oil and gas proppant industry downturn and pursue acquisitions and new growth opportunities as they arise. In December 2014, we upsized our revolving line-of-credit and amended our senior secured term loan facility (the &#8220;Term Loan&#8221;) by an additional $135.0 million to a total of approximately $500.0 million. As of December 31, 2015 , we had $277.1 million &#32;of cash on hand, $21.8 million &#32;in short-term investments and $46.7 million &#32;of availability under our revolving credit facility (the "Revolver"). 

Our Products 

In order to serve a broad range of end markets, we produce and sell a variety of commercial silica products, including whole grain and ground products, as well as other industrial mineral products that we believe complement our commercial silica products. 

Whole Grain Silica Products&#8212; We sell whole grain commercial silica products in a range of shapes, sizes and purity levels. We sell whole grain silica that has a round shape and high crush strength to be used as frac sand in connection with oil and natural gas recovery, and we have the capability to produce resin coated sand. During 2015, we announced the introduction of InnoProp&#174; Python RCS, a new high-performance resin coated proppant designed to increase the production of oil and gas wells in an economical and efficient manner. In early 2016, we introduced another new resin coated product, InnoProp&#174; PLT, 

which is a curable low-temperature product and can be used without an activator in oil and gas wells that have bottom-hole static temperatures down to 70&#176;F. 

We also sell whole grain silica products in a range of size distributions, grain shapes and chemical purity levels to our customers involved in the manufacturing of glass products, including a low-iron whole grain product sold to manufacturers of architectural and solar glass applications. In addition, we sell several grades of whole grain round silica to the foundry industry and provide whole grain commercial silica to the building products industry. Sales of whole grain commercial silica products and coated proppants accounted for approximately 88% , 87%, and 85% of our total sales revenue for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Ground Silica Products&#8212; Our ground commercial silica products are inherently inert, white and bright, with high purity. We market our ground silica in sizes ranging from 40 to 250 microns for use in plastics, rubber, polishes, cleansers, paints, glazes, textile fiberglass and precision castings. We also produce and market fine ground silica in sizes ranging from 5 to 40 microns for use in premium paints, specialty coatings, sealants, silicone rubber and epoxies. We believe we are currently the only commercial silica producer in the United States that manufactures a 5-micron product. Sales of ground silica products accounted for approximately 9% , 8%, and 12% of our total sales revenue for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;respectively. 

Industrial Mineral Products&#8212; We also produce and sell certain other industrial mineral products, such as aplite and magnesium silicate. Aplite is a mineral used to produce container glass and insulation fiberglass and is a source of alumina that has a low melting point and a low tendency to form defects in glass. We also produce and sell a highly selective adsorbent made from a mixture of silica and magnesium, used extensively in preparative and analytical chromatography. Sales of our other industrial mineral products accounted for approximately 3% , 5%, and 3% of our total sales revenue for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

&#32; Our Industry 

The commercial silica industry consists of businesses that are involved in the mining, processing and distribution of commercial silica. Commercial silica, also referred to as &#8220;silica,&#8221; &#8220;industrial sand and gravel,&#8221; &#8220;silica sand&#8221; and &#8220;quartz sand,&#8221; is a term applied to sands and gravels containing a high percentage of silica (silicon dioxide, SiO 2 ) in the form of quartz. Commercial silica deposits occur throughout the United States, but mines and processing facilities are typically located near end markets and in areas with access to transportation infrastructure. Other factors affecting the feasibility of commercial silica production include deposit composition, product quality specifications, land-use and environmental regulation, including permitting requirements, access to electricity, natural gas and water and a producer&#8217;s expertise and know-how. New entrants face serious hurdles to establish their operations, including: 

&#8226; 

the difficulty of finding silica reserves suitable for use as frac sand, which, according to the API, must meet stringent technical specifications, including, among others, sphericity, grain size, crush resistance, acid solubility, purity and turbidity; 

&#8226; 

the difficulty of securing contiguous reserves of silica large enough to justify the capital investment required to develop a mine, processing plant, product storage and rail track; 

&#8226; 

a lack of industry-specific geological, exploration, development and mining knowledge and experience needed to enable the identification, acquisition and development of high-quality reserves; 

&#8226; 

the difficulty of identifying reserves with the above characteristics that either are located in close proximity to oil and natural gas reservoirs or have the rail access needed for low-cost transportation to major shale basins; 

&#8226; 

the difficulty of securing mining, production, water, air, refuse and other federal, state and local operating permits from the proper authorities, a process that can require up to three years; and 

&#8226; 

the difficulty of assembling a large, diverse portfolio of customers to optimize operations. 

Extraction Processes 

Commercial silica deposits are formed from a variety of sedimentary processes and have distinct characteristics that range from hard sandstone rock to loose, unconsolidated dune sands. While the specific extraction method utilized depends primarily on the deposit composition, most silica is mined using conventional open-pit bench extraction methods and begins after clearing the deposit of any overlaying soil and organic matter. The silica deposit composition and chemical purity also dictate the processing methods and equipment utilized. For example, broken rock from a sandstone deposit may require one, two or three stages of crushing to liberate the silica grains required for most markets. Unconsolidated deposits may require little or no crushing, as silica grains are not tightly cemented together. 

We conduct only surface mining operations and do not operate any underground mines. Mining methods at our facilities include conventional hard rock mining, hydraulic mining, surface or open-pit mining of loosely consolidated silica deposits and dredge mining. Hard rock mining involves drilling and blasting in order to break up sandstone into sizes suitable for transport to the processing facility by truck, slurry or conveyer. Hydraulic mining involves spraying high-pressure water to break up loosely consolidated sandstone at the mine face. Surface or open-pit mining involves using earthmoving equipment, such as bucket loaders, to gather silica deposits for processing. Lastly, dredging involves gathering silica deposits from mining ponds and transporting them by slurry pipelines for processing. We may also use slurry pipelines in our hydraulic and open-pit mining efforts to expedite processing. Silica mining and processing typically has less of an environmental impact than the mining and processing of other minerals, in part because it uses fewer chemicals. Our processing plants are equipped to receive the mined sand, wash away impurities, eliminate oversized or undersized particles and remove moisture through a multi-stage drying process. Our 17 &#32;production facilities are located primarily in the eastern half of the United States, with operations in Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Each of our facilities operates year-round, typically in shift schedules designed to optimize facility utilization in accordance with market demand. Our facilities receive regular preventative maintenance, and we make additional capital investments in our facilities as required to support customer volumes and internal performance goals. For more information related to our production facilities, see Item 2, &#8220;Properties&#8221;. 

We believe we have a broad and high quality mineral reserves base due to our strategically located mines and facilities. At December 31, 2015 , we estimate that we had approximately 400 million &#32;tons of proven and probable recoverable mineral reserves. The quantity and nature of the mineral reserves at each of our properties are estimated by our mining engineers. Our mining engineers update our reserve estimates annually, making necessary adjustments for operations at each location during the year and additions or reductions due to property acquisitions and dispositions, quality adjustments and mine plan updates. Before acquiring new reserves, we perform surveying, drill core analysis and other tests to confirm the quantity and quality of the acquired reserves. In some instances, we acquire the mineral rights to reserves without actually taking ownership of the properties. For more information related to our production facilities, deposits and reserves, see Item 2, &#8220;Properties&#8221;. 

Production Processes 

After extracting the ore, the silica is washed with water to remove fine impurities such as clay and organic particles. In some deposits, these fine contaminants or impurities are tightly bonded to the surface of the silica grain and require attrition scrubbing to be removed. Other deposits require the use of flotation to collect and separate contaminants from the silica. When these contaminants are weakly magnetic, special high intensity magnets may be utilized in the process to improve the purity of the final commercial silica product. After the silica has been washed, most output is dried prior to sale. 

The next step in the production process involves the classification of commercial silica products according to their chemical purity, particle shape and particle size distribution. Generally, commercial silica is produced and sold in either whole grain form or ground form. Whole grain silica generally ranges from 12 to 140 mesh. Mesh refers to the number of openings per linear inch on a sizing screen. Whole grain silica products are sold in a range of shapes, sizes and purity levels to be used in a variety of industrial applications, such as oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing proppants, glass, foundry, building products, filtration and recreation. Some whole grain silica is further processed to ground silica of much smaller particle sizes, ranging from 5 to 250 microns. A micron is one-millionth of a meter. 

Quality Control 

We maintain a standard of excellence through our mining and processing facilities some of which include ISO 9001-registered quality systems. We use automated process control systems that efficiently manage the majority of the mining and processing functions, and we monitor the quality and consistency of our products by conducting hourly tests throughout the production process to detect variances. All of our major facilities operate a testing laboratory to evaluate and ensure the quality of our products and services. We also provide customers with documentation verifying that all products shipped meet customer specifications. These quality assurance functions ensure that we deliver quality products to our customers and maintain customer trust and loyalty. 

In addition, we have certain company-wide quality control mechanisms. We maintain a company-wide quality assurance database that facilitates easy access and analysis of product and process data from all plants. We also have fully staffed and equipped corporate laboratories that provide critical technical expertise, analytical testing resources and application development to promote product value and cost savings. The labs consist of different departments: a foundry lab, a paint and coatings lab, an analytical lab, a minerals-processing lab and an oil and gas lab. The foundry lab is fully equipped for analyzing foundry silica based on grain size distribution, acidity, acid demand value and turbidity, which is a measure of silica cleanliness. The paint and coatings lab provides formulation, application, and testing of paints, coatings and grouts for end use in fillers and extenders as well as building products. The analytical lab performs various analyses on products for quality control assessment. The minerals processing lab models plant production processes to test variations in deposits and improve 

our ability to meet customer requirements. The oil and gas lab performs testing and provides in-depth analysis of all types of hydraulic fracturing proppants to verify products meet specifications, such as API size and crush strength specifications. Additionally, this lab is responsible for the development of new resin coated products and the technical oversight of our Rochelle, Illinois facility. 

Distribution 

We ship our commercial silica products direct to our customers by truck, rail or barge and through our network of in-basin transloads. Recent trends in the oil and gas market and the expansion of our logistics footprint have resulted in more of our product volumes being transported by high-efficiency unit trains over the past two years. During 2015, we shipped 147 &#32;unit trains to both our transload sites and our customers. 

For bulk commercial silica, transportation cost represents a significant portion of the overall product cost. Generally, we utilize trucks for shipments of 200 miles or less from our plant sites and to distribute our bagged products. Given the weight-to-value ratio of most of our products, the majority of our shipments outside this 200-mile radius are by rail. As a result, facility location is one of the most important considerations for producers and customers. Generally, our plant sites are strategically located to provide access to all Class I railroads or in strategic shale basins, which enables us to cost effectively send product to points of end use in North America. 

We are continuously looking to increase the number of available transload points to which we have access. This approach allows us to provide strong customer service and puts us in a position to take advantage of opportunistic spot market sales. Through our storage facility in San Antonio, Texas, as well as our partnership with a number of key transload operating partners, we now have storage capacity near all of the major shale basins in the United States. Additionally, in 2015, we opened our Odessa, Texas, unit train receiving transload facility, which was built in partnership with Union Pacific Railroad to support mainly the Permian market. As of December 31, 2015 , we have 49 &#32;transload facilities strategically located in or near all major shale basins in the United States. For more information related to our transload facilities, see Item 2, &#8220;Properties&#8221;. 

All three methods of shipping are typically performed with equipment owned by third parties. Both we and our customers lease a significant number of railcars for shipping purposes, as well as to facilitate the short-term storage of our products, particularly our frac sand products. As of December 31, 2015 , we leased a fleet of 6,826 &#32;railcars, of which 2,490 were in storage. As a result of the current downturn in the oil and gas proppant end market in 2015, we have more cars under lease than we currently need. We are returning leased cars as their lease terms expire and are aggressively deferring or canceling additional leases to minimize the rail car storage and lease costs. 

In addition to bulk shipments, commercial silica products can be packaged and shipped in 50 to 100 pound bags or bulk super sacks. Bag shipments are usually made to smaller customers with batch operations, warehouse distributor locations or for ocean container shipments made overseas. The products that are shipped in bags are often higher value products, such as ground and fine. 

&#32; Primary End Markets 

The special properties of commercial silica-chemistry, purity, grain size, color, inertness, hardness and resistance to high temperatures-make it critical to a variety of industries. Commercial silica is a key input in the well completion process, specifically, in the hydraulic fracturing techniques used in unconventional oil and natural gas wells. In the industrial and specialty products end markets, stringent quality requirements must be met when commercial silica is used as an ingredient to produce thousands of everyday products, including glass, building and foundry products and metal castings, as well as certain specialty applications such high-performance glass, specialty coatings, polymer additives and geothermal energy systems. Due to the unique properties of commercial silica, it is an economically irreplaceable raw material in a wide range of industrial applications. Our major end markets include: 

Oil and Gas Proppants 

Commercial silica is used as a proppant for oil and natural gas recovery in conventional and unconventional resource plays. Unconventional oil and natural gas production requires hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation techniques to recover oil or natural gas that is trapped in the source rock and typically involves horizontal drilling. Frac sand is pumped down oil and natural gas wells at high pressures to prop open rock fissures in order to increase the flow rate of hydrocarbons from the wells. Proppants are also used in the "refracturing" process where older wells are restimulated using newer technologies and additional frac sand as a viable and lower-cost alternative to drilling new wells. The frac sand market experienced substantial growth from 2008 until 2014, driven by the growth in the use of hydraulic fracturing. However, during 2015, the frac sand market was negatively impacted due to reduced oil and gas drilling and completion activity in North America. 

Glass 

Commercial silica is a critical input into and accounts for 55% to 75% of the raw materials in glass production. The glassmaking markets served by commercial silica producers include containers, flat glass, specialty glass and fiberglass. Demand typically varies within each of these end markets. 

The container glass, flat glass and fiberglass end markets are generally mature end markets. Demand for container glass has historically grown in line with population growth, and we expect similar growth in the future. Flat glass and fiberglass tend to be correlated with construction and automotive production activity, both of which have been improving during the past couple of years. To the extent construction and domestic automotive production activity continues its growth in the coming years, which is difficult to predict given the current economic uncertainty, we expect that demand in these end markets will continue to increase. Specific markets such as those for solar glass have been negatively impacted by generally weak demand. Some of the anticipated growth in the glass markets may be offset through the use of recycled glass. 

Building Products 

Commercial silica is used in the manufacturing of building products for commercial and residential construction. Whole grain commercial silica products are used in flooring compounds, mortars and grouts, specialty cements, stucco and roofing shingles. Ground commercial silica products are used by building products manufacturers in the manufacturing of certain fiberglass products and additionally as functional extenders and to add durability and weathering properties to cementious compounds. In addition, geothermal wells are an alternative energy source that requires specialized ground silica products in their well casings for effectiveness. The market for commercial silica used to manufacture building products is driven primarily by the demand in the construction markets. The historical trend for this market has been one of growth, especially in demand for cementious compounds for new construction, renovation and repair. Although the housing construction market experienced a significant decline beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2011, we began to see an increase in permits and housing starts in 2012, gains that have continued during 2015. To the extent the housing market growth continues in the coming years, which is difficult to predict given the current economic uncertainty, we expect that demand in this end market will increase. 

Foundry 

Commercial silica products are used in the production of molds for metal castings and in metal casting products. In addition, commercial whole grain silica is sold to coaters of foundry silica, or coated internally, who then sell their product to foundries for cores and shell casting processes. The demand for foundry silica primarily depends on the rate of automobile and light truck production, construction and production of heavy equipment like rail cars. Over the past decade, there has been some movement of foundry supply chains to Mexico and other offshore production areas. In 2010, foundry demand decreased significantly as a result of the decrease in automotive and heavy equipment production. However, we experienced increases in foundry demand in 2011 and 2012. During 2015, this growth in the foundry markets continued. To the extent production levels continue to strengthen in the coming years, which is difficult to predict given the current economic uncertainty, we expect that demand in this end market will increase. 

Chemicals &#32; 

Both whole grain and ground silica products are used in the manufacturing of silicon-based chemicals, such as sodium silicate, that are used in a variety of applications, including food processing, detergent products, paper textile, specialty foundry applications and as inputs for some precipitated silicas. This end market is driven by the development of new products by the chemicals manufacturers, including specialty coatings and polymer additives as well as the growth of &#8220;green&#8221; tires. We expect this end market to grow as these manufacturers continue their product and applications development. 

Fillers and Extenders 

Commercial silica products are sold to producers of paints and coating products for use as fillers and extenders in architectural, industrial and traffic paints and are sold to producers of rubber and plastic for use in the production of epoxy molding compounds and silicone rubber. The commercial silica products used in this end market are most often ground silica, including finer ground classifications. The market for fillers and extenders is driven by demand in the construction and automotive production industries as well as by demand for materials in the housing remodeling industry. Although construction, domestic automotive production and housing remodeling demand decreased in 2009, we have continued to see strengthening in these sectors throughout 2015. To the extent these industries continue to recover in the coming years, which is difficult to predict given the current economic uncertainty, we expect demand to improve. 

Our Customers 

We sell our products to a variety of end markets. Our customers in the oil and gas proppants end market include major oilfield services companies that are engaged in hydraulic fracturing. Sales to the oil and gas proppants end market comprised approximately 67% , 76%, and 64% of our total sales revenue in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Our primary markets have historically been core industrial end markets with customers engaged in the production of glass, building products, foundry products, chemicals and fillers and extenders. Our diverse customer base drives high recovery rates across our production. We also benefit from strong and long-standing relationships with our customers in each of the industrial and specialty products end markets we serve. Sales to our industrial and specialty products end markets comprised approximately 33% , 24%, and 36% of our total sales revenue in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Our two largest customers are Oil &#38; Gas Proppants customers. Sales to these two customers, Schlumberger N.V. &#32;and Halliburton Company , accounted for 13% &#32;and 12% &#32;of our total revenues, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015 . No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues. 

Competition 

Both of our reporting segments operate in highly competitive markets that are characterized by a small number of large, national producers and a larger number of small, regional or local producers. According to a January 2016 publication by the United States Geological Survey (&#8220;USGS&#8221;), in 2015 , there were 230 &#32;producers of commercial silica with a combined 335 &#32;active operations in 35 &#32;states within the United States. Competition in the industry across both of our reporting segments is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution capability, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering and technical support. As transportation costs are a significant portion of the total cost to customers of commercial silica, in many instances transportation costs can represent more than 50% of delivered cost, the commercial silica market is typically local, and competition from beyond the local area is limited. Notable exceptions to this are the frac sand and fillers and extenders markets, where certain product characteristics are not available in all deposits and not all plants have the requisite processing capabilities, necessitating that some products be shipped for extended distances. Because the markets for our products are typically local, we also compete with smaller, regional or local producers. For more information regarding competition, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Our future performance will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive markets, and on our ability to appropriately react to potential fluctuations in demand for and supply of our products.&#8221; 

Seasonality 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact our production levels and our customers' business needs. For example, during the second and third quarters we sell more commercial silica to our customers in the building products and recreation end markets due to increased construction activity resulting from more favorable weather. First and fourth quarters can experience lower sales, and sometimes production levels, largely from adverse weather hampering logistical capabilities and general decreased customer activity levels. 

Intellectual Property 

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third-party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. Our intellectual property primarily consists of trade secrets, know-how and trademarks, including our name US SILICA &#174; &#32;and products with trademarked names such as OTTAWA WHITE &#174; , MIN-U-SIL &#174; , MYSTIC WHITE II &#174; , Q-ROK &#174; , SIL-CO-SIL &#174; , PREMIUM HICKORY &#174; , US SILICA WHITE &#174; &#32;and InnoProp &#174; , among others. We principally rely on trade secrets, rather than patents, to protect our proprietary processes, methods, documentation and other technologies, as well as certain other business information. Although we do seek patents from time to time, patent protection requires a costly and uncertain federal registration process that would place our confidential information in the public domain. As a result, we typically utilize trade secrets to protect the formulations and processes we use to manufacture our products and to safeguard our proprietary formulations and methods. We believe we can effectively protect our trade secrets indefinitely through the use of confidentiality agreements and other security measures. 

Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance 

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization and/or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, see Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and 

limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;. 

Commercial Team 

Our commercial team consists of more than 69 &#32;individuals responsible for all aspects of our sales process, including pricing, marketing, transportation and logistics, product development and general customer service. This necessitates a highly organized staff and extensive coordination between departments. For example, product development requires the collaboration of our market development team, sales team, our production facilities and our corporate laboratories. Our sales team interacts directly with our customers in determining their needs, our production facilities fulfill the orders and our corporate laboratories are responsible for ensuring that our products meet those needs. 

Our commercial team can be divided into five units: 

&#8226; 

Sales&#8212; Our sales team is organized by both region and end market. We have an experienced group of dedicated sales team members for the oil and gas proppants and the industrial and specialty end markets. Our oil and gas proppants team is led out of our Houston office and is regionally positioned in the oil and gas markets across the U.S. This staff consists of experienced experts in the use of frac proppants in the oil and gas industry. Our industrial and specialty products sales team is strategically located near our major customers. As we make decisions to enter or expand our presence in certain end markets or regions, we will continue to add dedicated team members to support that growth. 

&#8226; 

Marketing&#8212; Our marketing team coordinates all of our new and existing customer outreach efforts as well as identify emerging market trends and new product opportunities. This includes producing exhibits for trade shows and exhibitions, manufacturing product overview materials, participating in regional industry meetings and other trade associations and managing our advertising efforts in trade journals. 

&#8226; 

Transportation and Logistics&#8212; Our transportation and logistics team manages domestic and international shipments by directing inbound and outbound rail, barge and truck traffic, supervising equipment maintenance, coordinating with rail carriers to ensure equipment availability, ensuring compliance with shipping regulations and strategically planning for future growth. 

&#8226; 

Technical&#8212; Our technical team is anchored by our Industrial &#38; Specialty Products laboratory in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia and our oil and gas laboratory in Houston, Texas. At these facilities, we perform a variety of analyses including: 

&#8226; 

analytical chemistry by X-Ray Fluorescence (&#8220;XRF&#8221;) and Inductively Coupled Plasma (&#8220;ICP&#8221;) spectroscopy; 

&#8226; 

particle characterization by sieve, SediGraph, Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (&#8220;BET&#8221;) surface area and microscopy; 

&#8226; 

ore evaluation by mineral processing, flotation and magnetic separation; 

&#8226; 

API frac sand evaluation, including crush resistance; and 

&#8226; 

American Foundry Society (&#8220;AFS&#8221;) green sand evaluation by various foundry sand tests. 

Many other product analyses are performed locally at our 17 &#32;production facilities to support new product development, plant operations and customer quality requirements. 

We also have a variety of other technical competencies including process engineering, equipment design, facility construction, maintenance excellence, environmental engineering, geology and mine planning and development. Effective integration of these capabilities has been a critical component of our business success and has allowed us to establish and maintain an extensive, high-quality silica sand reserve base, maximize the value of our reserves by producing and selling a wide range of high-quality products, optimize processing costs to provide strong value to customers and prioritize operating in a safe and environmentally sustainable manner. 

&#8226; 

Customer Service&#8212; Our customer service team is dedicated to creating an exceptional customer experience and making it easy to do business with our company. The organization aims to accomplish this by consistently exceeding our customers&#8217; expectations, continually improving our performance, offering efficient and timely responses to customer needs, being available to our customers 24/7 and providing customers with personal points of contact on whom they can rely. 

&#160; Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed a workforce of 996 &#32;employees, the majority of whom are hourly wage plant workers living in the areas surrounding our mining facilities. The majority of our hourly employees are represented by labor unions that include the Teamsters Union; United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union; Laborers International Union of North America; Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union and; International Union of Operating Engineers A.F.I. - C.I.O. We believe that we maintain good relations with our workers and their respective unions and have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages since 1987. 

Our employees average approximately 11 &#32;years of tenure with us, and we have an annual employee turnover rate of 11% , excluding the impact of reductions in workforce as part of the restructuring actions. We believe our stable workforce has directly contributed to improved process efficiencies and safety, which in turn help drive cost reductions. We believe our labor rates compare favorably to other mining and manufacturing facilities in the same geographic areas. We maintain workers&#8217; compensation coverage in amounts required by law and have no material claims pending. We also offer all full-time employees a competitive package of employee benefits, which includes medical, dental, life and disability coverage. 

Regulation and Legislation 

Mining and Workplace Safety 

Federal Regulation 

The U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;MSHA&#8221;) is the primary regulatory organization governing the commercial silica industry. Accordingly, MSHA regulates quarries, surface mines, underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with quarries and mines. The mission of MSHA is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards. MSHA works closely with the Industrial Minerals Association, a trade association in which we have a significant leadership role, in pursuing this mission. As part of MSHA&#8217;s oversight, representatives perform at least two unannounced inspections annually for each above-ground facility. To date these inspections have not resulted in any citations for material violations of MSHA standards. For additional information regarding mining and workplace safety, including MSHA safety and health violations and assessments in 2015 , see Item 4, &#8220;Mine Safety Disclosures&#8221;. 

We also are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. OSHA regulates the customers and users of commercial silica and provides detailed regulations requiring employers to protect employees from overexposure to silica bearing dust through the enforcement of permissible exposure limits and the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard. 

Internal Controls 

We adhere to a strict occupational health program aimed at controlling exposure to silica bearing dust, which includes dust sampling, a respiratory protection program, medical surveillance, training and other components. Our safety program is designed to ensure compliance with the standards of our Occupational Health and Safety Manual and MSHA regulations. For both health and safety issues, extensive training is provided to employees. We have safety committees at our plants made up of salaried and hourly employees. We perform annual internal health and safety audits and conduct annual crisis management drills to test our plants&#8217; abilities to respond to various situations. Health and safety programs are administered by our corporate health and safety department with the assistance of plant Environmental, Health and Safety Coordinators. 

Environmental Matters 

We and the commercial silica industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation on, among other things, matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air and water emissions and environmental contamination and reclamation. A variety of state, local and federal agencies enforce this regulation. 

Federal Regulation 

At the federal level, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. We also may be required to obtain permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) (or the relevant state environmental agency in states where the permit program has been delegated to the state) for discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States, including 

discharges of wastewater or storm water runoff associated with construction activities. Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief. 

The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify our operational practices and obtain permits for our existing operations, and before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs because of these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations. 

As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to applicable requirements regarding the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these substances, including the relevant Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure requirements that the EPA imposes on us. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including those relating to claims for damage or injury to property and persons. 

Additionally, some of our operations are located on properties that historically have been used in ways that resulted in the release of contaminants, including hazardous substances, into the environment, and we could be held liable for the remediation of such historical contamination. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 

In addition, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate industrial solid wastes that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. 

Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (&#8220;NEPA&#8221;). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all &#8220;major federal actions&#8221; significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a &#8220;major federal action&#8221; that requires review under NEPA. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historical and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies&#8217; decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project. While NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit, or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party may challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review. 

Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with and are subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project&#8217;s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts. 

State and Local Regulation 

Because our operations are located in numerous states, we are also subject to a variety of different state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states in which our projects are located or are being developed have state laws similar to NEPA; thus our development of new sites or the expansion of existing sites may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if they are not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental 

review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project&#8217;s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations and scenic areas. Some states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and states may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements. 

As demand for frac sand in the oil and natural gas industry has driven a significant increase in current and expected future production of commercial silica, some local communities have expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize dust from getting airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the amount of practicable area for mining activities, provide compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. To date, we have not experienced any material impact or disruption to our existing mining operations or planned capacity expansions as a result of these types of concerns. 

We have a long history of positive engagement with the communities that surround our existing mining operations. We have an annual employee turnover rate of 11% , excluding the impact of reductions in workforce as part of the restructuring actions, and have had no significant strikes in more than 28 years, evidence of the strong relationship we have with our employees. We believe this strong relationship helps foster good relations with the communities in which we operate. Although additional regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, we believe our existing operations are less likely to be negatively impacted by virtue of our good community relations. 

Planned expansion of our mining and production capacity in new communities could be more significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Difficulty or delays in obtaining or inability to obtain new mining permits or increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators. 

Costs of Compliance 

We may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our activities. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory, cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also increase the cost of the development, construction and operation of our projects and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given project. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our activities. 

The process for performing environmental impact studies and reviews for federal, state and local permits for our operations involves a significant investment of time and monetary resources. We cannot control the permit approval process. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or whether such permits will be the subject of significant opposition. The denial of a permit essential to a project or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop a project. Significant opposition and delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could impair or delay our ability to develop a project. Additionally, the passage of more stringent environmental laws could impair our ability to develop new operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
