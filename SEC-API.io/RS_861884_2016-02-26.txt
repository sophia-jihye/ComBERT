We are the largest metals service center company in North America (U.S. and Canada). Our network of metals service centers operates more than 300 locations in 39 states in the U.S. and in 12 other countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey, the U.A.E. and the United Kingdom). Through this network, we provide metals processing services and distribute a full line of more than 100,000 metal products, including alloy, aluminum, brass, copper, carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium and specialty steel products, to more than 125,000 customers in a broad range of industries. Many of our metals service centers process and distribute only specialty metals. We deliver a variety of products from facilities located across the United States and Canada, and have grown our international presence selectively to support the globalization of our customers, giving us broad product, customer and geographic diversification. 

&#160; 

Our primary business strategy is to provide the highest levels of quality and service to our customers in the most efficient operational manner, allowing us to maximize our financial results. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions to enhance our product, customer and geographic diversification. We focus on improving the operating performance at acquired locations by integrating them into our operational model and providing them access to capital and other resources to promote growth and efficiencies. We believe our focused growth strategy of diversifying our products, customers and geographic locations makes us less vulnerable to regional or industry specific economic volatility and somewhat lessens the negative impact of volatility experienced in commodity pricing and cyclicality of our customer end markets, as well as general economic trends. We also believe that our focus on servicing customers with small order sizes and quick turnaround, along with our growth and diversification strategy have been instrumental in our ability to produce industry &#8209;leading operating results among publicly traded metals service center companies in North America. During 2015 , we handled approximately 5,647,000 transactions in total or an average of 22,350 transactions per business day, with an average price of approximately $1,660 per transaction. We generated net sales of $9.35 billion in 2015 and net income attributable to Reliance of $311.5 million. 

&#160; 

Currently we have one operating segment and one reportable segment, metals service centers. Further information about our reportable segments, including geographic information, appears in Note 16 &#8212; &#8220;Segment information&#8221; of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

Metals service centers acquire carbon steel, aluminum, stainless and alloy steel and other metal products from primary metals producers and then process these materials to meet customer specifications using techniques such as beam, bar and tube cutting; bending, forming and shaping; coil and flat roll processing; plate and sheet cutting; machining and various other specialized services such as laser cutting, fabricating, and mechanical polishing, among others. These processing services save our customers time, labor, and expense, reducing their overall manufacturing costs. Specialized metals processing equipment requires high &#8209;volume production to be cost effective. Many manufacturers and their suppliers are not able or willing to invest in the necessary technology, equipment, and warehousing of inventory to process the metals for their own manufacturing or processing operations. Accordingly, industry dynamics have created a niche in the market. Metals service centers purchase, process, and deliver metals to end &#8209;users in a more efficient and cost &#8209;effective manner than the end &#8209;user could achieve by dealing directly with the primary producer . Service centers comprise the largest customer group for North American mills, buying and reselling almost 50% of all the carbon, alloy, stainless and specialty steels, aluminum, copper, brass, bronze and superalloys produced in the United States according to a January 2016 report issued by IBISWorld Inc., a global intelligence publication. 

&#160; 

Metals service centers are generally less susceptible to market cycles than metals producers because service centers are generally able to pass on all or a portion of increases in metal costs to their customers, unless they are selling to their customers on a fixed &#8209;price contractual basis. We believe that service center companies, like Reliance, that emphasize rapid inventory turnover and minimal contract sales , are generally less vulnerable to changing metals prices than the metals producers . However, fluctuations in metal pricing have a significant impact on our revenue and profit. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In recent years, imports of metal into the U.S., especially of carbon steel products, have reached historical highs, putting significant downward pressure on metal prices and taking market share from the domestic mill producers, with many of the domestic producers reducing capacity. 

&#160; 

Customers purchase from service centers for a variety of reasons, including the ability to obtain value &#8209;added metals processing, readily available inventory, reliable and timely delivery, flexible minimum order size, and quality control. Many customers deal exclusively with service centers because the quantities of metal products that they purchase are smaller than the minimum orders specified by mills or because those customers require intermittent deliveries over long or irregular periods. Metals service centers respond to a niche market create d because of the focus on just &#8209; in &#8209;time inventory management and materials management outsourcing in the capital goods and related industries, and because the larger metal producers have reduced in &#8209;house direct sales efforts to small sporadic purchasers to enhance their production efficiency. &#160; In general, metal service center customers have placed increased emphasis on carrying lower amounts of inventory, especially during declining price environments. Many customers have also reduced their in-house processing, sourcing processed metal from service centers like us, which has spurred some of our recent capital expenditures and also contributed to improved gross profit margins. 

&#160; 

The metals service center industry is highly fragmented and competitive within localized areas or regions. Many of our competitors operate single, stand &#8209;alone service centers. According to IBISWorld Inc., the number of metal wholesale centers in the United States decreased from approximately 11,000 locations operated by more than 8,300 companies in 2002 to approximately 10,100 locations operated by more than 7,400 companies in 201 5 . This consolidation trend continues to create opportunities for us to expand by making acquisitions. 

&#160; 

According to IBISWorld Inc., the United States metals wholesale industry generated revenues of approx imately $202.2 billion in 2015 , a 13 % decrease over 201 4 revenues of $2 32.0 billion. The four largest U.S. metals service center companies are expected by IBISWorld Inc. to represent less than 10% of the estimated $212.8 billion industry total in 2016. While we remain the largest metals service center in the United States on a revenue basis, our 201 5 U.S. revenues of $8.62 bill ion accounted for only about 4.3% of the entire U.S. market in 201 5 according to IBISWorld Inc.

History and Overview of Reliance 

&#160; 

Reliance Steel &#38; Aluminum Co. was organized as a California corporation on February 3, 1939, and commenced business in Los Angeles, California fabricating steel reinforcing bar. Within t en years of our founding, we had become a full &#8209; line distributor of steel and aluminum, operating a single metals service center in Los Angeles. In the early 1950&#8217;s, we automated our materials handling operations and began to provide processing services to meet our customers&#8217; requirements. In the 1960&#8217;s, we began to acquire other companies to establish additional service centers, expanding into other geographic areas. 

&#160; 

In the mid &#8209;1970&#8217;s, we began to establish specialty metals centers stocked with inventories of selected metals such as aluminum, stainless steel or brass and copper, and equipped with automated materials handling and precision cutting equipment specific to the selected metals. In the mid &#8209;1990&#8217;s , we began to expand nationally and focused on acquiring well &#8209;run, profitable service center companies , and we continue to expand our network, with a focus on providing value-added services to our customers as opposed to merely distributing metal. 

&#160; 

We reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015. We continue to execute our growth strategy and have become the largest North American (U.S. and Canada) metals service center company based on revenues, with over 300 locations and 201 5 net sales of $9.35 billion. Although we continue to expand the types of metals that we sell and the processing services that we perform, we have not diversified outside of our core business and we strive to consistently perform as the best in our industry. We focus on smaller customers and order sizes with quick turnarounds . &#160; We currently operate metals service centers under the following trade names:

&#160; 

We serve our customers primarily by providing quick delivery, metals processing and inventory management services. We purchase a variety of metals from primary producers and sell these products in small quantities based on our customers&#8217; needs. We performed metals processing services, or first &#8209;stage processing, on approximately 47% of our sales orders in 2015 before delivering the products to our customers. Over the past few years we have steadily increased our percentage of orders with processing performed from a more traditional level of 40% because of increased demand for processing services by our customers in addition to acquisitions of companies that provide a higher level of value-added processing. For approximately 40% of our 2015 orders, we delivered the metal to our customer within 24 hours from receipt of the order. These services save our customers time, labor, and expense and reduce their overall manufacturing costs. During 2015 , we handled approximately 5,647,000 transactions in total or an average of 22,350 transactions per business day, with an average price of approximately $1,660 per transaction. Our 2015 net sales were $9.35 billion. We believe that our focus on small orders with quick turnaround differentiates us from many of the other large metals service center companies and allows us to better service our customers, resulting in higher profits than those generated by the other large metals service center companies. 

&#160; 

Historically, we have expanded through both acquisitions and internal growth. Since our initial public offering in September 1994, we have successfully purchased 60 businesses, including our recent acquisition of Tubular Steel, Inc. (&#8220;TSI &#8221;) in January 201 6 . Our internal growth activities during the last few years, which are supported by our capital expenditures, have been at historically high levels for us and have included the opening of new facilities, adding to our processing capabilities and relocating existing operations to larger, more efficient facilities. Our investments in processing equipment have allowed us to increase the percentage of value-added services that we provide to our customers, which supports increased gross profit margins and differentiate us from our competitors, allowing us to increase our market share. We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and we expect to continue to grow our business through acquisitions and internal growth initiatives, particularly those that will diversify our products, customer base and geographic locations. 

&#160; 

Capital Expenditures 

&#160; 

We maintain ed our focus on internal growth in 2015 by opening new facilities, building or expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment with total capital expenditures of $172.2 million . Our 2016 capital expenditure budget is approximately $ 180 million , much of which is again related to internal growth activities comprised of purchases of equipment and new facilities along with expansions of existing facilities. This reflects our confidence in our long &#8209;term prospects; however, we will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project and consider the economic conditions and outlook at the time of investment. We estimate our maintenance capital expenditures at approximately $ 60 &#160; to $80 million, which allows us to significantly reduce our capital expenditures if and when necessary. 

&#160; 

Operational Strategy 

&#160; 

Our executive officers maintain a control environment that is focused on integrity and ethical behavior, establish general policies and operating guidelines and monitor adherence to proper financial controls, while our division managers and subsidiary officers hav e autonomy with respect to day &#8209; to &#8209;day operations. This balanced yet entrepreneurial management style has enabled us to improve the productivity and profitability both of acquired businesses and of our own expanded operations. Key management personnel are eligible for incentive compensation based, in part, on the profitability of their particular division or subsidiary and, in part, on the Company&#8217;s overall profitability. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We seek to increase profitability through improvements in our customer service and operational efficiencies, as well as through profitable growth by expanding our existing operations and acquiring businesses that diversify or enhance our customer base, product range, processing services and geographic coverage. We also continue to adjust our business practices to leverage our size and gain efficiencies which contribute to our profitability. We believe that we have an excellent reputation in the industry and are known for our integrity and the quality and timeliness of our service to customers. 

&#160; 

Customers and Markets 

&#160; 

Our customers purchase from us and other metals s ervice centers to obtain value &#8209; added metals processing, readily available inventory, reliable and timely delivery, flexible minimum order size and quality control. Many of our customers deal exclusively with service centers because the quantities of metal products that they purchase are smaller than the minimum orders specified by mills, because those customers require intermittent deliveries over long or irregular time periods, or because those customers require specialized processing services. We believe that metals service centers have also enjoyed an increasing share of total metal shipments due to the focus of the capital goods and other manufacturing industries on just &#8209;in &#8209;time inventory management and outsourcing of materials management and metals processing. 

&#160; 

We have more than 125,000 customers in a variety of industries , including general manufacturing, non &#8209;residential construction, transportation (rail, truck trailer and shipbuilding), aerospace, energy, electronics and semiconductor fabrication, and heavy industry (agricultural, construction and mining equipment). We also service the auto industry, primarily through our toll processing operations where we do not take ownership of the metal. 

&#160; 

Although we sell directly to many large original equipment manufacturers ( &#8220; OEM &#8221;s ) customers , the majority of our sales are to small machine shops and fabricators, in small quantities with frequent deliveries, helping them manage their working capital and credit needs more efficiently. Our metals service centers wrote and delivered over 5,647,000 orders during 2015 at an average price of approximately $1,660 per order. Most of our metals service center cust omers are located within a 200 &#8209; mile radius of the Reliance metals service center serving them. The proximity of our service centers to our customers helps us provide just &#8209;in &#8209;time delivery and increases the likelihood of repeat business. In 2015 , approximately 97% of our orders were from repeat customers. With our fleet of approximately 1,750 trucks (some of which are leased), we are able to service many smaller customers and provide quick turnaround deliveries. Many of our competitors have struggled recently due to shortages in the availability of both trucks and qualified drivers to deliver products. Moreover, our computerized order entry systems and flexible production scheduling enable us to meet customer requirements for short lead times and just &#8209;in &#8209;time delivery. We believe that our long &#8209;term relationships with many of our customers significantly contribute to the success of our business. Providing prompt and efficient services and quality products at reasonable prices are important factors in maintaining and expanding these relationships. 

&#160; 

Our acquisitions in recent years have increased our international exposure both from a customer and physical location perspective. In addition, we have built and opened international locations in recent years to service specific industries, typically to support existing key customers that are operating in those international markets. Net sales of our international locations (based on where the shipments originated) accounted for approximately 8% of our consolidated 2015 net sales, or $ 732.8 million. However, our net sales to international customers (based on the shipping destination) were approximately 11% of our consolidated 2015 net sales or $985.3 million, with approximately 31% of these sales, or $308.5 million, to Canadian customers. See Note 16 &#8212; &#8220;Segment information&#8221; of Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on U.S. and foreign revenues and assets. 

&#160; 

Customer demand may change from time to time based on, among other things, general economic conditions and industry capacity. Many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature. Because we sell to a wide variety of customers in a variety of industries, we believe that the effect of such changes on us is significantly reduced. In addition, many of our customers are small job shops and fabricators who also have a diverse customer base and have the versatility to service different end markets when an existing market slows. 

&#160; 

The diversity of our customer base somewhat reduces the impact of any single customer, as our largest customer represented only 1.1% of our net sales in 2015 . We had only 24 customers to whom our 2015 annual sales were greater than $25 million.

Suppliers 

&#160; 

We primarily purchase our inventory from the major domestic metals producers. We do, however, also purchase certain products from foreign producers. We have multiple suppliers for all of our products. Our major suppliers of domestic carbon steel products include ArcelorMittal; Ca lifornia Steel Industries, Inc.; Evraz NA; Gerdau ; Nucor Corporation; Steel Dynamics, Inc.; SSAB ; and United States Steel Corporation. AK Steel, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, North American Stainless and Outokumpu are our major suppliers of stainless steel products. We are a recognized distributor for various major aluminum companies, including Alcoa Inc.; Aleris International, Inc.; &#160; Constellium N.V. ; Kaiser Aluminum Corp. ; Novelis Inc. ; and Sapa Group. Our major suppliers of alloy products include The Timken Company, Gerdau, and Nucor Corporation. 

&#160; 

Because of our total volume of purchases and our long &#8209;term relationships with our suppliers, we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the best prices offered by our suppliers . W e believe that these relationships provided us an advantage in our ability to source product and have it available for our customers in accelerated timeframes when needed, and also allows us to more efficiently manage our inventory . We believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier for our metal inventory . We believe both our size and our long-term relationships with our suppliers continue to be important because mill consolidation has reduced the number of suppliers. 

&#160; 

In 2014 and 2015 the domestic mills have lost market share to import material as historically high levels of metal are being imported into the U.S. Because of this, mill prices are at low levels and many mills have reduced capacity and as a group operated at a capacity of about 70% in 2015. Trade actions on many carbon steel products were filed in 2015 and a stainless steel action was filed in early 2016. We view these actions as helpful to the market, but believe that we will continue to see high levels of imports and pressure on metals pricing given the strength of the U.S. dollar and weak global markets. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Because of the just &#8209;in &#8209;time delivery and the short lead &#8209;time nature of our business, we do not believe information on our backlog of orders is material to an understanding of our business. 

&#160; 

Products and Processing Services 

&#160; 

We provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers&#8217; specifications and deliver products to fabricators, manufacturers and other end users. We maintain a wide variety of products in inventory, and believe this differentiates us from all other North American service centers. A substantial portion of our orders do not require extensive or specialized processing allowing delivery to the customer within 24 hours of receiving the order. This provides a competitive advantage to us, and, for the remainder of our orders we typically have shorter lead times than our competitors given our decentralized structure and investments in processing equipment. Our product mix has changed mainly as a 

&#160;

result of our targeted growth strategy to acquire companies with specialized inventory and processing services. Flat &#8209; rolled carbon steel products (i.e., hot &#8209;rolled, cold &#8209;rolled and galvanized steel sheet and coil), which generally have the most volatile and competitive pricing, ac counted for only 15 % of our 201 5 sales.

We are not dependent on any particular customer group or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals. This diversity of product type and material reduces our exposure to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial or economic stability of particular customers or industries. We are also less dependent on any particular suppliers as a result of our product diversification. 

&#160; 

For sheet and coil products, we purchase coiled metal from primary producers in the form of a continuous sheet, typically 36 to 60 inches wide, between 0 .015 and 0 .25 i nches thick, and rolled into 3 &#8209;to-20 ton coils. The size and weight of these coils require specialized equipment to move and process the material into smaller sizes and various products. Many of the other products that we carry also require specialized equipment for material handling and processing . Few of our customers have the capability to process the metal into the desired sizes or the capital available to acquire the necessary equipment . 

&#160; 

&#160;

After receiving an order, we enter it into one of our computerized order entry systems, select appropriate inventory and schedule processing to meet the specified delivery date. In 2015 , we delivered approximately 40% of our orders within 24 hours of the customer placing the order with us. We attempt to maximize the yield from the various metals that we process by combining customer orders to use each product that we purchase to the fullest extent practicable. 

&#160; 

We believe that f ew metals service centers offer the broad range of processing services and metals that we provide. In addition to a focus on growing in specialty products, we have also enhanced the level of value &#8209;added services with recent acquisitions and significantly upgraded and expanded our processing capabilities with significant investments in new equipment over the past few years , in particular for our businesses servicing the aerospace market and toll processing aluminum for the automotive industry . 

&#160; 

In 201 5 , we performed processing services for approximatel y 47% of our sales orders. Our primary processing services range from cutting, leveling or sawing to complete processes such as machining or electropolishing. Throughout our service centers we perform most processes provided in the industry, without encroaching upon the services performed by our customers. As part of our growth strategy, we have been expanding into higher value &#8209;added services, including certain fabrication processes, in markets where our customers are requesting that service centers provide these services. 

&#160; 

We generally only process specific metals to non &#8209;standard sizes pursuant to customer purchase order specification . In addition, we typically acquire standard size and grade products that can be processed into many different sizes to meet the needs of many different customers. We do not maintain a significant inventory of finished products, but we carry a wide range of metals to meet our customers&#8217; short lead time and just &#8209;in &#8209;time delivery requirements. Our metals service centers maintain inventory and equipment selected to meet the needs of that facility&#8217;s customers. We work with our customers to understand their needs and identify areas where we can provide additional value, increasing our importance to them. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 2,080 sales personnel located in 44 states in the U.S. and 13 &#160; other countries providing marketing services throughout each of those areas, as well as nearby locations. The sales personnel are organized by division or subsidiary among our profit centers and are divided into two groups. Our outside sales personnel travel throughout a specified geographic territory and maintain relationships with our existing customers and develop new customers. Inside sales personnel remain at the facilities to price and write orders . In addition to base salary, inside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit and/or pre &#8209;tax profit of thei r particular profit center. O utside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit from their particular geographic territories. 

&#160; 

Our business is very relationship based and because of that, we operate under many different trade names. We acquire well-run businesses with strong customer relationships and solid reputations within the marketplace. Because of this, we find value in the acquired trade &#160; name and continue to use the business name and maintain the customer relationships. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The metals distribution industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We have numerous competitors in each of our product lines and geographic locations, and competition is most frequently local or regional. Our domestic service center competitors are smaller than we are, but we also face strong competition from national, regional and local independent metals distributors and the producers themselves, some of which have greater resources than we do. In their January 2016 report on the metals wholesaling industry, IBISWorld Inc. estimated that in 2015 there were approximately 10,100 metal wholesale locations in the United States operated by approximately 7,400 companies. Nevertheless, t he four largest U.S. metals service center companies are expected to represent less than 10% of the estimated industry revenue in 2016. Based on the estimated 2015 metals wholesaling industry revenue of $202.2 billion , our U.S. revenues of $ 8.62 billion in 2015 accounted for approximately 4. 3 % of the entire U.S. market. We believe we are the largest North American (U.S. and Canada) metals service center company on a revenue basis. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We compete with other companies on price, service, quality and availability of products. We maintain relationships with our major suppliers at the executive and local levels. We believe that this division of responsibility has increased our ability to obtain competitive prices of metals by leveraging our total size and to provide more responsive service to our customers by allowing our local management teams to make the purchasing decisions . In addition, we believe that the size of our inventory, the diversity of metals and products we have available, and the wide variety of processing services we can provide distinguish us from our competition. We believe that our competitors do not have the financial ability or risk tolerance to grow their businesses, and it is difficult for them to compete with our state-of-the-art processing equipment. We believe that we have increased our market share during recent years due to our strong financial condition, our high quality of products and services from significant investments in our equipment and facilities, and our acquisitions, as well as our continued focus on small order sizes with quick turnaround. 

&#160; 

Quality Control 

&#160; 

Procuring high quality metal from suppliers on a consistent basis is critical to our business. We have instituted strict quality control measures to assure that the quality of purchased raw materials will enable us to meet our customers&#8217; specifications and to reduce the costs of production interruptions. In certain instances, we perform physical and chemical analyses on selected raw materials, typically through a third party testing lab, to verify that mechanical and dimensional properties, cleanliness and surface characteristics meet our requirements and our customers&#8217; specifications. We also conduct certain analyses of surface characteristics on selected processed metal before delivery to the customer. We believe that maintaining high standards for accepting metals ultimately results in reduced return rates from our customers. 

&#160; 

We maintain various quality certifications throughout our operations . Approximately 60% of our operating locations are ISO 9001:2008 certified. Many of our locations maintain additional certifications specific to the industries they serve, such as aerospace, auto, nuclear, and others, including certain international certifications. 

&#160; 

Systems 

&#160; 

A common financial reporting system, as well as certain other accounting, tax and HRIS systems are used company &#8209;wide. However, we maintain various transactional software applications across our operations that meet the needs of those operations. Generally, these systems provide information in real time, such as inventory availability, location and cost and may be customized with features to accommodate the products the respective operations carry, automated equipment interfaces, or other specialized requirements . With this information, our marketing and sales personnel can respond to our customers&#8217; needs more efficiently and more effectively. 

&#160; 

We have initiated efforts to customize and implement a common ERP platform across our operating companies, in order to maximize functionality and efficiencies across the organization, while also reducing risk. We are also evaluating tools to assist us in efforts to consolidate data more efficiently. These are multi &#8209;phased, multi &#8209;year projects that will be pursued and implemented in a manner to limit both operational and financial risk. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our metals service centers are subject to many foreign, federal, state and local requirements to protect the environment, including hazardous waste disposal and underground storage tank regulations. The only hazardous substances that we generally use in our operations are lubricants, cleaning solvents and petroleum for fueling our trucks. We pay state &#8209;certified private companies to haul and dispose of our hazardous waste. 

&#160; 

Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and related regulations, which, among other requirements, establish noise, dust and safety standards. We maintain comprehensive health and safety policies and encourage our employees to follow established safety practices. Safety of our employees and others is critical to our success. We continue to expand and improve our internal safety resources, which has contributed positively to our safety metrics and financial results. We encourage social well &#8209;being by instituting these high quality labor, health and safety standards. We do not anticipate that continued compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We are subject to the conflict mineral provisions of the Dodd &#8209;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Ac t of 2010 . We are required to undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether the products we sell originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We verify with our suppliers the origins of all metals used in our products. 

&#160; 

We sell metals to foreign customers and otherwise operate abroad, subjecting us to various countries&#8217; trade regulations concerning the import and export of materials and finished products. O ur operations are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace, including the United States&#8217; Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;) and the United Kingdom&#8217;s Bribery Act 2010. We have developed and implemented company &#8209;wide export and anti &#8209;corruption policies designed to provide our employees clear statements of our compliance requirements and to ensure compliance with applicable export and anti &#8209;corruption regulations. For information about risks related to government regulation, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption &#8220; Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8221; including the Risk Factors captioned &#8220;We are subject to various environmental, employee safety and health and customs and export laws and regulations, which could subject us to significant liabilities and compliance expenditures;&#8221; &#8220;We operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, exchange controls, political risks and other risks relating to international operations;&#8221; and &#8220;Our international operations continue to expand, exposing us to additional risks.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Environmental 

&#160; 

Some of the properties we own or lease are located in industrial areas with histories of heavy industrial use. We may incur some environmental liabilities because of the location of these properties. In addition, we are currently involved with certain environmental remediation projects related to activities at former manufacturing operations of Earle M. Jorgensen Company (&#8220;EMJ&#8221;), our wholly owned subsidiary, that were sold many years prior to Reliance&#8217;s 2006 acquisition of EMJ. Although the potential cleanup costs could be significant, EMJ maintained insurance policies during the time they owned the manufacturing operations that have covered substantially all of our expenditures related to this matter to date, and are expected to continue to cover the majority of the related costs. We do not expect that these obligations will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

&#160; 

We believe that all scrap metal produced by our operations is recycled by the independent scrap metal companies and producers to whom we sell our scrap metal. We continue to evaluate and implement energy conservation and other initiatives to reduce pollution and improve our environmental impact. Enactment of more stringent environmental regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial results. 

&#160; 

Although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these regulations, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur any violations and resulting penalties from such activity. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 14,000 employees. Approximately 11% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which expire at various times over the next five years. Approximately 500 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2016. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with 41 union locals at 51 of our locations. These collective bargaining agreements have not had a material impact either favorably or unfavorably on our revenues or profitability at our various locations. We have always maintained excellent relations with our employees. Over the years we have experienced minor work stoppages by our employees at certain of our locations, but due to the small number of employees and the short time periods involved, these stoppages have not had a material impact on our operations. We have never experienced a significant work stoppage. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Some of our customers are in seasonal businesses, especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses. As a result of our geographic, product and customer diversity our overall operations have not shown any material seasonal trends. Typically, revenues in the months of July, November and December have been lower than in 

&#160;

other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products, resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers. We ca nnot assure you that period &#8209;to &#8209; period fluctuations will be consistent with historical patterns. Results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results. 

&#160;
