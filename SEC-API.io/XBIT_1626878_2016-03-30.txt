 ITEM 1 BUSINESS Overview 

XBiotech is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering and developing True Human&#8482; monoclonal antibodies for treating a variety of diseases. True Human&#8482; monoclonal antibodies are those which occur naturally in human beings&#8212;as opposed to being derived from animal immunization or otherwise engineered. We believe that naturally occurring monoclonal antibodies have the potential to be safer and more effective than their non-naturally occurring counterparts. While focused on bringing our lead product candidate to market, we also have developed a True Human&#8482; pipeline and manufacturing system.

The majority of our efforts to date have been concentrated on developing MABp1 (also known as Xilonix&#8482;, CA-18C3, CV-18C3, RA-18C3, and T2-18C3), a therapeutic antibody which specifically neutralizes interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 a ). IL-1 a is a pro-inflammatory protein produced by leukocytes and other cells, where it plays a key role in inflammation. When unchecked, inflammation can contribute to the development and progression of a variety of different diseases such as cancer, vascular disease, inflammatory skin disease, and diabetes. Our clinical studies have shown that blocking IL-1 a with MABp1 may have a beneficial effect in several diseases.

We completed a Phase I and II clinical trial for MABp1 as a treatment for cancer at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The results of this study, published in Lancet Oncology in April 2014, found that in the 52 patients with metastatic cancer (18 tumor types) who participated, MABp1 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities or immunogenicity. Moreover, within eight weeks of starting therapy many patients began to improve with respect to constitutional symptoms. An imaging method, known as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), revealed that many of the patients improved physically, in terms of gaining lean body mass; and patient reported outcomes documented that many were recovering from pain, fatigue and appetite loss. Finally, we found that in the patients with colorectal cancer, DEXA-measured recovery was associated with significant improvement in survival.

We received a fast track designation from the FDA in October 2012 to develop Xilonix&#8482; as a treatment in the setting of metastatic colorectal cancer. The purpose of the fast track designation is to aid in the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that have the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening disease. Currently one Phase III study is underway in the United States for advanced refractory colorectal cancer. We recently completed another Phase III study in Europe for symptomatic colorectal cancer at the end of 2015. With the success of the European Phase III trial, we are now in the process of seeking marketing approval for MABp1 at the European Medicines Agency. If the United States Phase III trial is also successful, we will seek marketing approval for MABp1 at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Assuming such marketing approvals are obtained, we would distribute and sell this product through our own direct sales force or with a commercial partner.

We are also investigating MABp1 in clinical trials for other indications including vascular disease, type II diabetes, acne and psoriasis. In a randomized Phase II study involving 43 patients, we evaluated MABp1 for its ability to reduce adverse events after balloon angioplasty, atherectomy or stent placement in patients undergoing revascularization procedures for blockage of the superficial femoral artery (SFA), a major artery in the leg. While the study did not involve a large enough patient population to provide a statistically significant outcome, results from this study showed an important trend towards the reduction of restenosis and reduced incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) in treated patients compared to the control group. In 2012, we obtained a fast track designation to develop MABp1 as a therapy to reduce the need for re-intervention after treatment of peripheral vascular disease with angioplasty or other endovascular methods of treatment. We have also entered into an agreement with Dr. Peter Libby, to examine the effects of IL-1 a blockade in mouse models of acute myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis.

In a Phase II pilot study completed in 2012, we tested MABp1 in patients with type II diabetes. A treatment-related decline in HbA1c, and increased serum levels of pro-insulin and C-peptide (indicators of improved glucose control and pancreas function, respectively) were observed. We also conducted two Phase II pilot studies in skin disease, evaluating the potential benefit of MABp1 in subjects with (1) moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and (2) moderate to severe acne vulgaris. The psoriasis study revealed rapid improvements in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), with patients having a median of 43% improvement within 35 days. In the acne study, treated patients exhibited a continual improvement in lesions over the course of therapy, with up to 42% reduction in eight weeks; and interestingly, these patients had a statistically significant improvement in anxiety, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We continue to analyze our clinical results, and prioritize further clinical initiatives for MABp1 in oncology, SFA, diabetes, psoriasis and acne.

&#160;

We recently filed an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for a True Human&#8482; Antibody therapy we are developing to treat infections due to Staphylococcus aureus. This product candidate was identified from an individual that harbored a natural antibody capable of neutralizing drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. This agent is currently progressing through a Phase I and II study, after being released from clinical hold last year. The hold was implemented by the FDA so that an animal toxicology study could be performed prior to dosing patients in clinical trials.

In February 2015, we received a blood donation from an Ebola-recovered patient, which was confirmed to have high levels of anti-Ebola antibodies. We signed an agreement with the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) to test these antibodies, and by October 2015, their results showed that 8 out of our 10 antibodies candidates were able to neutralize the deadly Ebola virus using in vitro assays. In addition, we received the blood donations from two patients that had each recently recovered from Ebola infection through our contractual relationship with the South Texas Blood &#38; Tissue Center, a 501(c) not for profit organization (STBTC), and have an obligation to pay STBTC a low single-digit royalty payment on any Ebola product that we develop based on these donations,

More recently, we have begun using our True Human&#8482; antibody technology to develop a therapy against clostridium difficile. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a bacterium that can cause severe infections in the gastrointestinal tract. The infection is greatest for individuals who are being treated with antibiotics, those that are hospitalized or in nursing homes, and the elderly. Additionally, about 1 in 5 patients that become infected with C. diff experience a relapse and need to be re-treated. Over the past decade, C. diff has emerged as a significant public health threat, and we feel that it is a serious and unmet need for patients worldwide. In fact, the colorectal cancer (CRC) has designated it as an &#8220;Urgent threat level&#8221;, meaning that it is an immediate public health threat that requires urgent and aggressive action.

Our True Human&#8482; antibody therapeutics are developed in-house using our proprietary discovery platform. Identifying True Human&#8482; antibodies useful for therapeutics may involve screening thousands of blood donors. To distinguish the clinically relevant antibodies from irrelevant background antibody molecules in donor bloods, we use our Super High Stringency Antibody Mining (SHSAM&#8482;) technology. After we identify donors, we undertake a complex process identifying the responsible genes for producing the native antibody. Once the nucleic acid sequence is isolated, we are able to clone these genes into production cells to manufacture large quantities of product candidate for use in humans. All patents and other intellectual property relating to both the composition of matter and methods of use of our True Human&#8482; antibodies were developed internally by us. We manufacture these antibodies using a proprietary expression system licensed from Lonza Sales AG. The manufacturing process we have developed incorporates both proprietary and non-proprietary technology.

A key aspect of our manufacturing system involves the use of simple disposable bioreactor technology. Our manufacturing operation is currently located within our forty-six thousand square foot facility in Austin, Texas. To accommodate larger-scale commercial manufacturing needs, we purchased 48 acres of industrial-zoned property located five miles from Austin&#8217;s central business district. In September 2014, we commenced ground-breaking on a new manufacturing facility on this property. Construction is estimated to be completed by mid 2016, with an anticipated operation date in mid 2016.

A Background on Therapeutic Antibodies 

A century ago scientists and physicians envisioned being able to custom design therapeutic agents that were highly specific for a single biological target. By selectively attacking disease while sparing healthy tissue, these &#8220;magic bullets&#8221; were thought to be ideal therapeutic agents. It was not until the early 1970&#8217;s, however, that this vision was realized when Kohler and Milstein developed a ground-breaking method for making target-specific monoclonal antibodies&#8212;a Nobel prize-winning endeavor. Using this new approach, numerous monoclonal antibody-based research, diagnostic, and therapeutic products have been developed.

Kohler and Milstein&#8217;s discovery was based on their knowledge that the immune system of higher animals produces antibodies as a method of protecting them from various potentially damaging agents such as viruses, bacteria, and diseased cells. White blood cells known as B cells produce billions of different types of antibodies, each with a unique potential to selectively attach to and neutralize different disease targets. The vast array of possible treatments based on antibodies lead to the development of what is now a major industry around the use of therapeutic antibodies.

&#160;

True Human&#8482; Antibodies 

White blood cells in the human body secrete billions of different antibodies that circulate through the blood to react and protect us from toxins, infectious agents or even other unwanted substances produced by our body. True Human&#8482; antibodies, as the name implies, are simply those that are derived from a natural antibody identified from the blood of an individual.

To develop a True Human&#8482; antibody therapy, donors are screened to find an individual that has a specific antibody that matches the desired characteristics needed to obtain the intended medical benefit. White blood cells from that individual are obtained, the unique gene that produced the antibody is cloned, and the genetic information is used to produce an exact replica of the antibody sequence. A True Human&#8482; antibody is therefore not to be confused with other marketed antibodies, such as so-called fully human antibodies&#8212;where antibody reactivity is developed through gene sequence engineering in the laboratory.

Fundamental Science of True Human&#8482; Antibodies 

To appreciate the background safety and tolerability of True Human&#8482; antibodies, it is important to consider the fundamental biology of natural antibody production.

Billions of different white blood cells secrete billions of unique antibodies every day into the circulation. The vast number of different antibodies (and cells that produce them), are essential to enable adequate molecular diversity to ward off all potential infectious or toxic threats. In other words, since antibodies act to bind and thereby neutralize unwanted agents, any given circulating antibody must be able to react with a potentially limitless number of existing or evolving disease entities.

The staggering number of different antibodies needed to achieve this level of preparedness, however, is a daunting concept from a genetics point of view. If an individual antibody gene was needed to encode each of a billion different antibodies, there would be 20,000 times as many genes needed just for antibodies as there would be needed to encode the rest of the entire human genome. Individual cells would need to be gigantic, and monumental resources would be required to make, copy and maintain all of the DNA. Clearly, the system of antibodies could not have evolved to protect us, had not an elegant solution emerged to deal with this genetic conundrum.

Thus a hallmark of the immune physiology of all vertebrates (all have antibodies) is the ability to recombine and selectively mutate a relatively small number of gene segments to create a phenomenal and effectively unlimited number of antibody genes. By rearranging, recombining and mutating the genetic code, specialized white blood cells, or B lymphocytes, are able to create an unlimited array of antibody genes. The consequence of this genetic engineering, however, is that each antibody gene is unique to the individual B lymphocyte that created it&#8212;and no copy of the gene exists in the human germline. The only place to find a unique antibody gene is in the individual cells that created it.

The extraordinary process of gene rearrangement and mutation results in a multitude of unique B lymphocytes and consequently an incredibly diverse repertoire of antibodies in any given individual.

Elucidating the mechanisms behind the production of unique antibody genes must be considered one of the major achievements of medical research in the 20th century. Yet unfolding this mystery created another problem to solve: If antibodies were not produced from genes encoded in the human genome and the products of these genes were new to the body, why were these antibody molecules not recognized by the immune system as foreign substances&#8212;like any other foreign substance that they were intended to eradicate? How could the body distinguish the apparently &#8220;foreign&#8221; antibody molecules from the bona fide infectious intruders?

Unraveling the genetics of antibody production led to another major advance in medicine: the discovery of how an endless array of antibody proteins could be made in a way that individual molecules were always tolerated by the body.

In the early 1990s research began to demonstrate that the production of antibodies was not an unregulated process. Rather, it was learned that the antibodies produced by each and every B lymphocyte were subject to intense scrutiny. Studies showed that B lymphocytes which produced acceptable antibodies were stimulated to grow while those that produced &#8220;autoreactive&#8221; antibodies were not. B lymphocytes that produced &#8220;good&#8221; antibodies were stimulated to proliferate, and enabled to produce copious amounts of antibody in the event it was needed to ward off a harmful agent. B lymphocytes that rearranged genes to produce antibodies that were ineffective or were autoreactive were given signals that instructed them to engage in a process of programmed cell death. Thus B lymphocytes producing harmful or useless antibodies are simply killed off. This mechanism for creating antibody diversity on the one hand, while protecting the individual from a mass of unwanted or intolerable antibody molecules on the other, was as elegant as it was fundamental to the success of vertebrate immune physiology.

&#160;

This process of &#8220;selection&#8221; has been elucidated in great detail. There can be no more important feature of immune physiology than the process of selection. Selection is a fundamental step to enable the body to produce an extremely diverse set of antibody molecules without, in the process, producing an array of novel molecules that cause harm.

Industry Context 

Until now each and every therapeutic antibody on the market has been derived from animals and/or through gene sequence modification in the laboratory to produce a desired antibody reactivity. Marketed antibodies to date, described as &#8220;fully human&#8221;, are not derived from human gene sequences that have undergone the crucial process of selection in a human.

Without exception, all marketed products to date that are described as &#8220;fully human&#8221;, are in fact engineered and are not selected based on natural tolerance in the human body. The use of the term fully human to describe these products has thus created considerable confusion. To our knowledge, there are at present no True Human&#8482; antibodies manufactured using recombinant protein technology currently marketed. If successful in clinical development, our lead product Xilonix&#8482; is expected to be the first True Human&#8482; therapeutic antibody to be commercialized.

Platform Technology 

There are significant technical challenges in identifying and cloning genes for True Human&#8482; antibodies. A key problem to overcome can be to first identify individuals with the desired antibody reactivity. This can involve screening hundreds of donors to enable the identification of a single, clinically relevant antibody&#8212;discovered from literally trillions of irrelevant background antibody molecules in the blood of donors. We screen human donors to find an individual who has in his or her blood a specific antibody that we believe will be protective against a certain disease. White blood cells from that individual can then be isolated, and the unique gene that produced the antibody obtained. We currently obtain blood donor samples through a Research and Collaboration Agreement with the South Texas Blood &#38; Tissue Center, a Texas 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. See "Intellectual Property- Other Commercial Licenses."

Novel cloning technologies developed at XBiotech have enabled us to clone the crucial antibody gene sequences from these donors in order to reproduce a True Human&#8482; antibody for use in clinical therapy. A True Human&#8482; monoclonal antibody should therefore not be confused with other marketed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as those currently referred to as fully human antibodies.

Market Opportunity 

We have a number of indications in various stages of clinical or pre-clinical development with significant market opportunities. These include oncology, diabetes, dermatology and infectious disease indications. At present, our therapy for colorectal cancer, in which we have completed one Phase III study and have another ongoing, is the most advanced.

Cancer Business and the Market for Colorectal Therapies 

The development of new therapies for the treatment of cancer continues to be a fundamental area of focus and growth in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry. Detailed and thorough analysis of the oncology business, including that for colorectal cancer, is available from a number of research specialists. In brief, over the past decade expenditures in R&#38;D and revenues derived from oncology related sales have continued to grow largely as anticipated. According to the independent research group IMS Health, the market for cancer drugs grew at an annual rate of about 5% between 2008 and 2013, which is slower than previous years, but still makes it by far the largest sector of the pharmaceutical industry. In 2017, they predict between $74 and $84 billion in sales, double that of the second place area of sales, which is diabetes.

The three major regional markets for cancer drugs are the United States, Europe and Japan, with US sales representing about 40% of the global market share. The largest revenue earners in the oncology space are the therapeutic antibodies Avastin, Herceptin and Rituximab, with combined sales reported to be over $20 billion in 2013.

&#160;

The market for colorectal cancer (CRC) drugs is expected to grow, according to the independent research group RnRMarketResearch.com, at a compound annual growth rate of 1.8%, to reach $9.4 billion in annual sales over the next 5 years. The US market for CRC therapeutics commands about 44% of the global business, more than double that of the next biggest market, Japan.

According to RnRMarketResearch.com, however, growth for the CRC drug business is expected to be tempered by increasing availability of biosimilar competitors, particularly those challenging leading products such as Avastin and Herceptin. There is also a substantial pipeline for CRC therapeutics across the industry in various stages of commercialization that are expected to bring new drugs to patients and competition to the market place.

An intense industry focus on developing new therapies for CRC is not surprising since this a highly prevalent form of cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, Surveillance Research 2015, nearly 130,000 men and women in the United States will be diagnosed with CRC in 2015. This represents almost 20% of all forms of cancer that will be diagnosed in 2015. In terms of mortality, as many as 50,000 people are expected to die from the disease in 2015 and many more will be refractory to existing therapy.

Our therapeutic antibody Xilonix&#8482; is being evaluated as a monotherapy to treat advanced stages of colorectal cancer. If Xilonix&#8482; therapy proves successful in both its Phase III clinical programs, it will have demonstrated the ability to not only increase survival of patients, but also to facilitate recovery and reduce debilitating symptoms of the disease.

We are aware of no other cancer therapy either marketed or in development that achieves overall survival benefit and in the course of treatment improves quality of life, and facilitates physical recovery of advanced cancer patients. While the market for CRC drugs is competitive and dynamic, in the event marketing approval is established for Xilonix&#8482;, we expect this therapy to be a highly valued and unique therapy in oncology, providing for significant market share in advanced CRC.

Our Strategy 

Our objective is to fundamentally change the way therapeutic antibodies are developed and commercialized, and become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic True Human&#8482; antibodies. The key goals of our business strategy are to:

&#8226; Obtain regulatory approval to market and sell Xilonix &#8482; in the United States, Europe and other markets, and begin commercial sale of Xilonix &#8482; ; &#8226; Continue our research and clinical work on infectious diseases, including S. aureus ; &#8226; Review our clinical results for SFA, diabetes, psoriasis and acne and determine additional research or clinical studies, which we may conduct in the future; &#8226; Discover other True Human&#8482; antibody therapies using our proprietary platform; and &#8226; Leverage our manufacturing technology. &#160;

&#160;

Product Pipeline 

Our product development status for the fourth quarter of 2015 was as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

There continues to be a highly active commercial pipeline of therapeutic antibodies globally, involving a complex array of development cycles as products reach the end of their patent life and as new candidate products proceed into pivotal studies and approach registration. While there are numerous independent reviews on the subject in both trade journals and academic press, XBiotech has analyzed and attempted to synthesize these publicly available data in order to understand, at least at the broadest level, the competitive landscape for its products.

While we believe True Human&#8482; therapeutic antibodies are an important positive differentiating factor from other monoclonal antibodies currently marketed, we also believe the unique activity of our anti-cancer therapeutic Xilonix&#8482;, which is being tested for its ability to both improve well beings and extend life. If proven in our Phase III clinical programs, we feel Xilonix&#8482; will be highly differentiated in the market place for colorectal cancer therapeutics. However, regardless of the potential advantages or uniqueness of Xilonix&#8482; in the market, we do expect these products to compete head-to-head with the numerous existing candidate antibody products in development, including emerging biosimilar therapeutic antibodies.

&#160;

&#160;

As reported in the National Review of Drug Discovery (October 2010), more than 140 &#8220;fully human&#8221; antibodies had entered clinical studies and from 2004-2013 nineteen antibody therapeutics were approved in the US for marketing, with some antibodies receiving marketing approval in multiple indications (Reichert JM, Antibodies to Watch in 2014. mAbs. 6:4, 799-802). Thus the competitive landscape is both broad and complex (See below Table).

In 2015 the immune stimulating antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, received additional approvals thus expanding their labels melanoma into additional tumor types. Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab were approved for the treatment of NSCLC after the failure of a platinum based regimen. Nivolumab was also approved for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of prior anti-angiogenic therapy, as well as in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Pembrolizumab&#8217;s melanoma label was also expanded to now include first line treatment.

&#160;

Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are anticancer agents that work by activating the immune system, such that it may stimulate an immune-mediated anti-tumor cytotoxicity. There are a number of antibodies that are in development for, or have reached the oncology market, such as ipilimumab, based on this general mechanism of action. While approvals have been forthcoming with these therapies, these agents share in common severe side effects without achieving high rates of durable remission. In advanced malignant disease, these agents have and will likely continue to achieve success in the market place. Both pembrolizumab and ipilimumab are approved for the treatment of melanoma, a disease for which we currently have no clinical development plans for Xilonix&#8482;. However, with respect to the overall competitiveness of these approaches vis-&#224;-vis Xilonix&#8482;, our Phase III clinical programs are intended to demonstrate overall survival benefit that is generally consistent with those observed with cytotoxic therapies in refractory disease. Additionally, in the case of Xilonix&#8482;, we are also attempting to demonstrate improved life quality and physical recovery. We expect that Xilonix&#8482; will therefore compete favorably with this new and emerging class of anti-cancer antibodies.

Current Clinical Investigation Activity 

European Registration Study Oncology 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase III registration study in Europe. Clinical sites were located in a number of different EU member states, in addition to Russia. The study evaluated MABp1, or Xilonix&#8482;, as an anticancer therapy in patients with symptomatic colorectal cancer.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of Xilonix&#8482; in reversing symptoms in patients with symptomatic colorectal cancer. By blocking Interleukin-1 alpha, a cytokine involved in the growth and spread of tumors as well as a mediator of cancer associated symptoms, Xilonix&#8482; therapy showed a statistically significant improvement in an objective response criteria as compared with placebo. This response criteria, which was developed and approved as part of the EMA Scientific Advice Procedure, evaluated a novel co-primary endpoint designed to assess clinical benefit in advanced mCRC by reversing symptoms as part of an anti-neoplastic effect.

The population studied consisted of patients with mCRC and tumor associated symptoms at baseline. Tumor related symptoms were chosen that are reliably measurable and indicative of disease progression. Moreover, symptoms were identified that, in the event of improvement, would also likely predict survival benefit for patients. For the purpose of inclusion criteria, tumor related symptoms were classified in two categories: metabolic and functional. To meet the criteria of the metabolic domain of symptoms, patients were required to have either:

1. Any degree of weight loss in the previous 6 months, which is known to predict shortened survival or; 2. A serum Interleukin-6 level &#8805;10 pg/ml. Elevated IL-6 levels, while widely used as a marker of systemic inflammation, have also been shown to correlate with shortened survival in many tumor types. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated quality of life instrument for assessment of cancer related symptoms. This instrument has been used in numerous oncology studies, and large meta-analyses examining patient responses have shown that a higher degree of symptoms predicts a shortened survival across all tumor types 5 . Symptom related criteria defined as functional, while quantitated with a highly reliable and validated instrument, the EORTC QLQ-C30, are entirely self-reported.

Patients included in the study were required to have evidence of one objective symptom from the metabolic domain, and one self-reported symptom from the functional domain. In addition, only those patients with performance status of 1 or 2, as measured by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale, were eligible for entry. Together, these inclusion criteria selected for a uniquely advanced and frail population.

&#160;

For the co-primary endpoints, patients were assessed for stabilization or improvements in lean body mass, as measured by DEXA, combined with an assessment of patient well-being with respect to pain, fatigue and/or appetite loss. Specifically, stabilization or a gain in lean body mass at the 8-week follow up combined with improvement or no worsening in two of the latter measures of patient well-being, as measured by the validated EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. To be considered a responder for the primary endpoint, a patient needs to meet both response criteria.

The study started in July 2014, completed in November 2015, and enrolled a total of 333 patients. The data cleaning, conducted shortly after the completion of the study, showed that fewer than expected patients were available for data analysis. We presented a short overview of these findings in a press release on November 23, 2015. As per the prospective analysis plan, the data from 24 patients was excluded from final analysis of the data as they discontinued study prior to receiving a single dose of either Xilonix&#8482; or placebo. Because the study endpoints were satisfactorily achieved, we proceeded to submit a Marketing Authorization Application package to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on March 7.

US Registration Study Oncology 

A Phase III randomized study using Xilonix&#8482; was started in March 2013 (IND #114,759). The study, which was recruiting patients at over sixty cancer centers in the United States was halted by us in September 2014 to propose changes in inclusion criteria to the FDA to enable faster patient recruitment. Amendments were proposed and agreed to by the FDA in order to correct what we believed to be unnecessary enrollment barriers.

Changes to the study protocol included eliminating the 5% weight loss requirement for patients and terminating the use of megesterol acetate (megace) in the control arm. The new agreed upon protocol will enable recruitment of all advanced, refractory colorectal patients regardless of weight loss, and use a 2:1 double-blinded randomization against placebo rather than a 1:1 randomization against megace. Treatment of patients under the new protocol commenced in April 2015. Enrollment under the revised protocol is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016.

Phase II study Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG) 

A phase II open-label exploratory study is underway to evaluate MABp1 for treatment of the rare skin disorder PG (IND # 112,459). PG is a chronic condition characterized by inflamed, non-healing skin ulcerations. The study is evaluating safety and efficacy of the therapy to facilitate wound healing and is being conducted at 5 sites in the United States. Primary endpoints of study involve clinicians&#8217; and patients&#8217; global assessment at day 28 from baseline. Patients who are found to be responding to therapy, but who have not yet experienced complete resolution of their lesion(s) after 28 days of therapy may participate in up to 3 additional 28-day cycles. Up to 10 patients will be enrolled on this trial, and enrollment is expected to be complete in the first half of 2016.

Phase I and II Study for Staphylococcus Aureus 

We filed an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for a Phase I and II randomized clinical study to assess our True Human&#8482; Antibody therapy for the treatment of serious infections due to Staphylococcus aureus. This product candidate was identified from an individual that harbored a natural antibody capable of neutralizing S. aureus, including drug-resistant strains of the bacteria. The study is currently progressing through Phase I and II after being on clinical hold, at the request of the FDA, as we completed an animal toxicology study. The animal study was completed in the first quarter of 2015. The Phase I, dose escalation, portion of the study began in July 2015. The Phase II portion of the study is expected to be completed in 2016.

Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 

We entered into a Letter of Agreement at the end of 2015 with the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group to develop and help facilitate a Phase II study to assess Xilonix TM in combination with Tarceva for the treatment of NSCLC. The protocol is still under development, and is expected to launch in Canada and begin enrollment in Q2 2016. This study is a follow up to the Phase I study enrolling all comers in a solid tumor study at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. In particular, the data collected from a subgroup of NSCLC patients were published in Investigational New Drugs in March 2015. These results highlighted the potential for combination therapy in NSCLC patients treated with EGFR inhibitors. In the MD Anderson study NSCLC patients had metastatic, refractory disease at baseline and were treated with Xilonix&#8482; monotherapy until disease progression. Patients that received prior treatment with Tarceva appeared to have considerably better outcomes than those that had not received Tarceva. In the study, radiographic evidence of tumor response, changes in lean body mass and quality of life were assessed and patients were followed for 24 months for survival analysis. Furthermore, stratification by prior therapies revealed a median overall survival for patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy of 9.4 months compared to only 4.8 months for non-pretreated patients.

&#160;

&#160;

Cardiovascular Disease 

In the first quarter of 2016, we announced a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) with Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. XBiotech will provide Antibodies to block the inflammatory mediator interleukin 1 alpha while Novartis Pharmaceuticals will provide an interleukin 1 beta antibody to a research team headed by cardiovascular medicine specialist Dr. Peter Libby. The research team will conduct pre-clinical studies to assess the potential of these antibodies to reduce injury to the heart muscle after heart attack, as well as comparing the treatment effects of these antibodies on inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques.

Summary of Clinical Findings to Date 

Safety 

Our lead product under development, MABp1, is derived from a natural human immune response. We expected that this would facilitate better tolerability when used as a therapeutic compared to humanized or &#8220;fully human&#8221; monoclonal antibodies. Antibody therapies are known to be associated with significant risk for infusion reactions, including serious anaphylactic reactions. We believe that these reactions are the result of using antibodies that were not derived from natural human immunity but rather had engineered specificities. Based on scientific principles of antibody physiology, a fundamentally important premise was that our True Human TM antibody therapy should be safer and result in less infusion-related complications than engineered human antibodies when used in clinical studies.

As illustrated in the table below, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, even those so-called &#8220;fully human,&#8221; have been associated with infusion reactions (see table below). Over 2000 doses of MABp1 have been administered to more than 300 patients in nine different clinical trials . As of March 3, 2016, there have been 2 infusion reactions with MABp1.

Completed Phase III Double-Blinded Placebo Controlled Study for Xilonix TM in Colorectal Cancer 

The Phase III study succeeded with respect to the prospective primary and secondary endpoints for Xilonix therapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. A Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency to seek approval for sale in Europe.

Patients enrolled in the Phase III study had metastatic or unresectable colorectal cancer after failure or intolerabilty of oxaloplatin or irinotecan regimens. Many patients had also failed additional other therapies. Xilonix therapy showed excellent safety and tolerability in this advanced, even infirm population, where patients had multiple symptoms, functional impairment, and included individuals over 70 years of age.

Colorectal cancer is the 2 nd leading cause of cancer in the industrialized world and at least half of patients diagnosed will succumb to the disease. Incidence of colorectal cancer parallels economic development, and with economic growth the incidence is rising worldwide. Since currently half of all patients diagnosed with the disease will progress to advanced, metastatic disease and ultimately succumb to the disease, there is a substantial and growing unmet medical need for a therapy for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Xilonix is the first anti-tumor therapy developed to address specific disease-related morbidities of advanced colorectal cancer.

Xilonix has continually showed an absence of frank toxicity, and in the Phase III colorectal cancer study the antibody acted to reduce progression of morbidity associated with advanced colorectal cancer. Notably, the therapy mediated its anti-cancer activity without apparent compromise to host immunity, thereby eliminating what has been one of the most important and troubling risk factors for anti-cancer therapy in advanced disease.

The Phase III study was specifically designed to evaluate therapy in a group of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Patients enrolled were required to have multiple symptoms of disease&#8212;each correlating with poor prognosis. Symptoms included: weight loss or elevated systemic inflammation, pain, fatigue or anorexia; and also to have functional impairment, as defined by an ECOG status 1 or 2 and included individuals beyond 70 years of age.

The Phase III primary endpoint to determine efficacy was based demonstrating an improved objective response rate for Xilonix therapy. For the 309 patients that received at least one dose of either Xilonix or placebo, there was a 76% relative improvement in objective response rate for patients receiving test article compared to placebo (p=0.0045). The secondary endpoints in the study were important were established prognosticators of overall survival, namely a measure of paraneoplastic thrombocytosis and systemic inflammation. Xilonix treated patients had an 80% reduction in thrombocytosis (p=0.003), and a 60% reduction in systemic inflammation (p=0.004) compared to placebo, respectively.

In addition to the planned primary and secondary analyses, patients treated with Xilonix were found to be 53% more likely to have stable disease compared to placebo. There was also a 26% reduction in the incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in the treatment arm compared to placebo. We are not aware of previous reports for anti-tumour therapy in advanced disease where an effect has been seen with respect to control of disease-related morbidity. Similarly, we are not aware of a previous report of a reduction in SAEs for an anti-tumour therapy compared to a placebo control population (See Table).

We believe the clinical evidence supports the use of Xilonix as a novel therapy for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer and thus a marketing authorization application has been submitted to the regulatory authorities in Europe. The unique mechanism of action and novel clinical findings suggest a breakthrough anti-tumor therapy to address significant unmet medical needs&#8212;namely for treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer that have failed or cannot further tolerate cytotoxic regimens.

Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 

Sixteen evaluable NSCLC patients were treated using MABp1 monotherapy (Xilonix&#8482;) as part of the Phase I and II clinical trial for MABp1 (Xilonix&#8482;) at MD Anderson Cancer Study in Houston, Texas under IND #105,958. The study design was single arm, and examined radiographic tumor response, change in lean body mass as measured by DEXA, change in quality of life, and overall survival. NSCLC Patients with both pulmonary and non-pulmonary or only non-pulmonary metastases have been reported to have median time to death from date of disease progression of 3.2 months which was reported in Changes in the Natural History of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC))&#8212;Comparison of Outcomes and Characteristics in Patients with Advanced NSCLC Entered in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trials Before and After 1990 (Heather Wakelee and et al, 2006 American Cancer Society).

The NSCLC patients treated with MABp1 monotherapy all entered the study with progressive refractory disease and all had pulmonary and/or non-pulmonary metastasis.

Overall survival for the NSCLC patients treated in this study was 7.6 months, which is notably greater than 3.2 months. Stratification based on prior anti-EGFR therapy revealed a median survival of 9.4 months (IQR 7.6-12.5) for those pretreated with Tarceva &#174; (N=10) versus a survival of 4.8 months (IQR 4.3-5.7) for those without (N=6, logrank p=0.187).

The first figure below compares patient overall survival after treatment with MABp1 with that observed in another study with Tarceva &#174; , a drug recently approved for treating NSCLC. The median survival for patients treated with Xilonix&#8482; was 7.6 months. It should be noted that 63% of the Xilonix&#8482; patients had taken Tarceva &#174; and failed. This compares with median survival for a similar patient population treated with Tarceva &#174; , which is a historical control group, where survival was only 6.7 months. Overall survival in the control population in the Tarceva &#174; study was 4.7 months. The comparison between overall survival observed with Xilonix&#8482; and that of the Tarceva &#174; study should be viewed with caution, since the patient populations or supportive care or other factors may have been different between the two studies making direct comparison difficult.

&#160;

The second figure compares overall survival of MABp1 treated patients based on whether or not they received pre-treatment with Tarceva &#174; . These findings suggest a remarkable interaction between Tarceva &#174; pre-treatment and MABp1. Survival in the Tarceva &#174; pre-treated group was nearly double compared to those who had not received Tarceva &#174; previously.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

When overall survival was analyzed according to pre-treatment status, it was found that having received, but failed Tarceva &#174; , correlated with significantly increased survival. The Kaplan-Meier curves compare survival of patients who had either received and failed (green line) or had not received (gray line) treatment of Tarceva &#174; prior to receiving MABp1 treatment. This subset analysis reveals that patients who had received Tarceva &#174; treatment prior to receiving MABp1 live longer on average than patients who did not receive Tarceva &#174; . This type of analysis may help in designing future trials of MABp1.

Colorectal Cancer 

Results from a Phase II Randomized Study in Cardiovascular Disease 

XBiotech completed a multi-center Phase II clinical study in cardiovascular medicine with 43 patients in 2013 (IND #110,908). The study was conducted at nine investigative sites in the United States. This Phase II randomized, controlled clinical study evaluated the therapeutic antibody MABp1 for its ability to reduce adverse events after balloon angioplasty, atherectomy or stent placement in patients undergoing revascularization procedures for blockage of a major artery (superficial femoral artery or SFA) in the leg. Interim data from this study was submitted to the FDA and resulted in fast track designation for this drug development program in the fall of 2012.

While the study was exploratory in nature and not powered with patient numbers to provide a statistically significant outcome, clinical results to date have shown an important trend towards the reduction of restenosis, and reduced incidence of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) in treated patients compared to controls. Patients were monitored for restenosis, or MACE, including heart attack or stroke.

All of the subjects included in this trial had symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, characterized by claudication, rest pain, or limited gangrene. All patients had hemodynamically significant occlusion of the femoral artery. Subjects eligible for enrollment had to be undergoing endovascular intervention as a part of standard of care treatment. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive (i) study drug plus standard of care or (ii) standard of care following surgery.

Data analyzed from the study suggests a beneficial treatment effect at 15 weeks. The patients received intravenous infusions of MABp1 at day 0 peri-operative, and at days 14, 28 and 42 post-operative. At 15 weeks no patients (0/22) in the treatment arm had experienced re-occlusion (restenosis) of the treated artery, whereas 3 patients (3/21) had restenosis in the control arm. Three patients (3/22) had MACE in the treatment arm, compared to 5 (5/21) in the control group.

&#160;

&#160; 

These data, together with the FDA fast track designation, have supported advancement of the clinical trial program for the treatment of vascular injury and disease.

&#160;

Dermatology 

Inflammatory skin conditions encompass a wide range of diagnoses from common conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis, to more rare conditions such as pyoderma gangrenosum. One common factor unifying the pathophysiology of these conditions is IL-1 a , a pro-inflammatory cytokine present in keratinocytes and inflammatory cells present in skin lesions. We believe that blockade of IL-1 a will prove to be a safe and effective treatment for numerous dermatologic conditions.

Psoriasis 

XBiotech completed a multicenter, single arm Phase II study of MABp1 in eight patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (IND #112,459). This clinical trial was launched after a dramatic response was observed in a psoriasis patient who was treated with MABp1 on a compassionate basis. The patient seen was a 48 year-old male with Type I psoriasis vulgaris. After a single treatment, the patient showed almost complete resolution of psoriasis lesions within 10 days. The Phase II exploratory study involved providing psoriasis patients three subcutaneous injections of the antibody to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of the treatment. Numerous efficacy assessments were made, including the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and performance measures, assessed with the use of the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Questionnaire and Physicians Global Assessment (PGA). Findings revealed rapid improvement in patients treated with MABp1, with a median response of 43% improvement in PASI score in just 35 days 1 .

Acne 

A Phase II exploratory study launched in 2012 and completed in 2013 evaluated MABp1 therapy in moderate to severe acne vulgaris (IND #112,459). The acne study was a single-arm, multicenter study conducted in the United States. This study examined changes in the number of inflammatory acne lesions, as well as patient reported changes in psychiatric symptoms. Eleven patients were administered open-label, subcutaneous injections of MABpl over a six-week period (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01474798). Objectives were assessment of safety, change in inflammatory lesion count and change in psychosocial functioning using two validated questionnaires.

&#160;

Patients showed significant improvement in the number of facial inflammatory lesions after treatment with MABp1. Median inflammatory lesion counts decreased 36% (IQR -44% to 1%). Anxiety scores improved (from median 6 to 1) as well as self-image assessment (2.3&#177;0.9 to 2.1&#177;0.1) as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the modified Body Image Disturbance Questionnaire, respectively. There were no serious adverse events, or adverse events greater than grade I.

Diabetes (Type II) 

XBiotech conducted a Phase II pilot study to test MABp1 in seven patients with Type II diabetes at the University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland. The study was headed by an endocrinologist and expert on the role of inflammatory disease in diabetes, Dr. Marc Donath, Head of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at University Hospital of Basel. This study was conducted with appropriate due diligence and authorization equivalent to a US FDA IND, under the Swiss regulatory authority SwissMedic.

The clinical study assessed safety and pharmacokinetics of MABp1 in the diabetic patient population. The study also examined patients to determine if their diabetes improved, including assessing pancreas function and glucose control.

Patients were given a low dose of MABp1 intravenously every two weeks for a total of four doses (Days 0, 14, 28, and 42). To be eligible for treatment, patients needed to have been diagnosed with Type II diabetes according to American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria at least three months prior to the study.

&#160;

To examine the trend of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels along the study time points, a trend analysis was performed on patients who completed all visits. Compared to baseline, after the 60 days period of treatment HbAlc was reduced by 0.14&#177;0.21% (p=0.15), fasting C-peptide was increased by 88% (p=0.03), pro-insulin by 48% (p=0.03) and insulin by 74% (P=0.ll). Systolic blood pressure decreased by 11 mmHg (p=0.2). Both HbAlc and blood pressure rebounded to baseline levels thirty days after the end of MABp1 application. Treatment with MABpl was well tolerated and no adverse events occurred during the study. This increase in HbA1c after removal of the drug, further suggested the activity for antibody therapy in these type 2 diabetic patients.

&#160;

Because the patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostics companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, the patents owned and licensed by us, or any future patents, may not prevent other companies from developing similar or therapeutically equivalent products or ensure that others will not be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or require licensing and the payment of significant fees or royalties. Furthermore, to the extent that any of our future products or methods are not patentable, that such products or methods infringe upon the patents of third parties, or that our patents or future patents fail to give us an exclusive position in the subject matter claimed by those patents, we will be adversely affected. We may be unable to avoid infringement of third party patents and may have to obtain a license, defend an infringement action, or challenge the validity of the patents in court. A license may be unavailable on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming, and we may be unable to prevail in any such patent litigation or devote sufficient resources to even pursue such litigation.

&#160;
