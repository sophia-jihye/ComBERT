 Item 1. Business. 

Resort Savers, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Resort Savers&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 25, 2012.

Our fiscal year end is January 31. Resort Savers has limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied solely upon the sale of our securities for funding. Resort Savers has never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or been involved in any kind of legal proceeding.

On August 1, 2014, a change of control of the Company occurred, whereby a controlling interest in the Company was sold by Michelle LaCour, our former President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and director and a former 5% stockholder, and James LaCour, our former Secretary and director and a former 5% stockholder, to the following: (1) Zhou Gui Bin (236,733 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share); (2) Zhou Wei (236,733 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share); and (3) Zong Xin International Investment Holdings Co. LTD (&#8220;Zong Xin&#8221;) (1,636,734 shares at a purchase price of $0.20 per share).

On September 25, 2014 the Company effected a forward stock split of 10 shares of common stock for each share held, or an additional nine shares were issued for each common share held. All share and per share information has been retroactively restated for financial presentation of prior periods.

From January 2015 through March 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 28,708,315 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company to unaffiliated investors, none of whom reside in the United States. More specifically, (i) on January 31, 2015, the Company issued 23,684,360 shares of common stock of the Company to unaffiliated investors at $0.07 per shares for $1,650,000, and (ii) in March 2015, the Company issued 5,023,955 shares of common stock of the Company to unaffiliated investors in exchange for 1,000,000 common shares of Borneo Resource Investments Ltd (&#8220;BRI&#8221;), with a value of $350,000.

Worx America, Inc. 

From January 2015 through March 2015, the Company, by and through its wholly owned subsidiary, Xing Rui International Investment Holding Group Co., Ltd., a Seychelles corporation (&#8220;Xing Rui&#8221;), acquired 20,068,750 common shares of Worx America, Inc. (&#8220;Worx&#8221;), a private company based in Houston, Texas, in exchange for $1,650,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRI with a value of $350,000 were paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 20,068,750 common shares of Worx, representing 20% of Worx's the then issued and outstanding voting common stock on a fully converted and diluted basis. More specifically, (i) on January 28, 2015, $350,000 cash was paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 5,403,728 common shares of Worx and (ii) on March 20, 2015, $1,300,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of BRI with a value of $350,000 were paid by the Company to Worx in exchange of 14,665,022 common shares of Worx. This investment was accounted for under equity method with initial cost of $2,000,000.

Worx designs automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system reduces tank cleaning time, reduces or eliminates the need for personnel to enter tanks, and may reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank. Actual results vary from tank to tank and may involve variables including the product in the tank, physical condition of the tank such as corrosion, or amount of sludge accumulated. Worx is currently refining its product line to improve speed and efficiency. Our investment in Worx has facilitated this development. We hope that our investment into what we believe is an important technology will give us early access to the technology, establish relationships in the industry, and allow us to assist Worx with the launch of its commercial products in China and other parts of Asia.

Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd. 

On October 1, 2015, the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Xing Rui, by and through a newly formed People&#8217;s Republic of China (the &#8220;PRC&#8221;) corporation subsidiary Huaxin Changrong (Shenzhen) Technology Service Company Limited (&#8220;Huaxin&#8221;), completed a purchase from Xu Xiao Yun of sixty percent (60%) of the shares of Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co.

Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd. 

On January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;) with Mr. Yang Baojin, a citizen of the PRC, and Huaxin, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Xing Rui, whereas Xing Rui itself is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Baojin is the president and majority owner of Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the PRC (&#8220;BYTOC&#8221;).

The Exchange Agreement provides that the Company will issue 6,000,000 shares of its common stock to Mr. Baojin, and Mr. Baojin will deliver to Huaxin an ownership interest in BYTOC such that Huaxin will own 51% of all ownership interests in BYTOC, provided that 1,200,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (20% of the common stock to be delivered to Mr. Baojin) will be withheld by the Company for a period of 12 months in order to secure against breach by Mr. Baojin of his representations and warranties contained in the Agreement, as well as to secure the fulfillment of his covenants and further obligations under the Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;).

&#160;

Under the Exchange Agreement, Mr. Baojin guarantees, for five years, that BYTOC will have an annual net income of Renminbi (the currency of the PRC &#8211; &#8220;RMB&#8221;) 10 million. To the extent that in any year the actual net income of BYTOC is less than RMB 10 million, then Mr. Baojin will pay Huaxin a cash payment equal to 51% of the shortfall.

The Exchange Agreement was approved by a written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company on January 29, 2016 and the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement occurred concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Exchange Agreement.

As a result of the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement, Huaxin now owns a majority of the ownership interest of BYTOC.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status

Emerging Growth Company

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.

Smaller Reporting Company

We also qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements.
