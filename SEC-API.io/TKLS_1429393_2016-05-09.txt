 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Bollente Companies Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on March 7, 2008. The Company is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona and currently operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bollente, Inc., a Nevada corporation incorporated on December 3, 2009. 

Bollente manufactures and sells a high quality, whole-house, electric tankless water heater that is more energy efficient than conventional products. 

On August 13, 2015, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Bollente International, Inc. (&#8220;Bollente International&#8221;) to begin international manufacturing and sales expansion for our trutankless&#174; line of water heaters. 

Bollente International has partnered with international manufacturing firm to increase production and efficiently handle distribution to customers in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe, Asia, Dubai, Australia and New Zealand. We have begun the testing and certification process for several international standards, demonstrating that the product complies with the essential requirements of European health, safety and environmental protection legislation and opening the gate for future sales to more than 30 European countries. 

Products 

Trutankless&#174; 

We manufacture and distribute trutankless&#174; water heaters, a line of new, high-quality, highly efficient electric tankless water heaters. Our trutankless&#174; water heaters are engineered to outperform and outlast both its tank and tankless predecessors in energy efficiency, output, and durability. It provides endless hot water on demand for a whole household and it also integrates with home automation systems. We have several features and design innovations which are new to the electric tankless water heater market that we believe will give our products a sustainable competitive advantage over our rivals in the market. 

Our trutankless&#174; water heaters are designed to provide an endless hot water supply because they are designed to heat water as it flows through the system. We believe that our products are capable of higher temperature rise than competitive units at given flow rates because of its improved design and greater efficiency. Our trutankless&#174; water heaters can save energy and reduce operating costs compared to tank systems because unlike tanks, if there is no hot water demand, no energy is being used. In addition, we intend to improve life-cycle costs with an improved design conceived not only to increase efficiency, but also the longevity of our products versus competitive units. Generally, a typical tank water heater lasts about 11 years, whereas gas tankless systems may last longer, but requires more routine maintenance. Our product line is designed to last longer than tank water heaters without any routine maintenance required under most conditions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We created a custom heat exchanger for our trutankless&#174; product line that utilizes our patent pending Velix technology to heat water as it flows through the system, which means customers need not worry about running out of hot water. We believe we&#8217;ve selected the best materials available and a collection of exclusive design elements and features to maximize capacity, minimize energy use, and provide a truly maintenance free experience. 

Our trutankless&#174; water heaters were officially launched in the first quarter of 2014 and is sold throughout the wholesale plumbing distribution channel. As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $265,504 &#160; in revenue. 

&#8195; 

In July of 2014, we launched MYtankless, a customizable online control panel for our trutankless&#174; line of smart electric water heaters. From the dashboard, residential and commercial users can obtain real-time status reports, adjust unit temperature settings, view up to three years of water usage data, and change notification settings from anywhere in the world, using a computer or web-enabled smart device at www.mytankless.com. 

Additionally, service professionals can also use the dashboard to monitor system status on every unit they install, allowing them to proactively contact their customers if a service or warranty appointment is needed. 

Our primary markets, Florida, Texas, Arizona, and the rest of the Sunbelt region are centers of growth in the U.S. construction industry with green building at an all-time high, and an unprecedented appliance replacement cycle. We intend to take advantage of these powerful macro-economic trends.

truCirc 

truCirc is a high-tech, smart-home water circulation pump. The energy reducing, water-saving truCirc can be used as a standalone product or with our multi-award winning trutankless&#174; electric tankless water heater. truCirc represents the next step in our mission to pioneer forward-thinking technology that changes the way people think about hot water. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

A traditional water circulation pump circulates hot water through a home&#8217;s pipes, enabling homeowners to have instant, on-demand hot water as soon as they turn on the faucet and saving countless gallons of water that would have been wasted. truCirc takes the traditional pump to the next level with multiple hot water delivery strategies including a self-aware learning mode that tracks water usage in a household and predicts when hot water will be needed-- thereby using energy to keep water hot only when it&#8217;s desired. truCirc&#8217;s simple, modern, high-tech interface allows homeowners to quickly and easily change delivery modes or choose a zone or fixture to send hot water. Thermostatic shut-off valves can be installed at showerhead points of use throughout a home to further eliminate wasted water. 

Our new product, truCirc, was unveiled on January 20, 2015 at the 2015 International Builders&#8217; Show in Las Vegas. 

Vero 

On April 16, 2015, we announced the release of Vero, our new line of electric tankless water heaters geared towards budget-driven customers. Vero boasts the same water heating performance, durability and space savings of our flagship tankless water heater. 

Intellectual Property &#38; Proprietary Rights 

Upon completion of our brand development, we will regard substantial elements of our brands and underlying intellectual property as proprietary and attempt to protect them by relying on trademark, service mark and trade secret laws, restrictions on disclosure and transferring title and other methods. 

Our plans are to actively pursue patent and trademark protection for all of newly developed products, both domestically and abroad. We have novel and proprietary technologies related to our product line and the central focus of our patent counsel has been to work with our engineers to build a defensible patent portfolio. 

To date, we have filed and received a United States federal trademark registration for trutankless&#174; and our logo design with the help of our outside marketing and branding experts and have acquired several unique domain registrations reflective of our online marketing strategy (www.bollente.com). During the year ended December 31, 2013, our patent agent filed ta provisional patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office with the US Patent and Trademark Office with 37 claims based on our prototype design. Upon completion of our engineered prototype, we expect to file additional patents with additional claims. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain a formal patent for our tankless water heater. We will continue to protect our intellectual property through confidentiality agreements with vendors and consultants and trade secret protocols employed by employees, consultants, and contractors. 

Growth Strategy 

Bollente&#8217;s product launched in Q1 2014 and is sold through the wholesale plumbing distribution channel. Gas tankless manufacturers&#8217; support of this sales channel was critical in their ability to quickly capture appreciable market share in the $3.6 billion replacement market. No electric tankless has been available solely through wholesale distribution which has welcomed the arrival of trutankless. Bollente&#8217;s sales and service training programs geared towards plumbers and contractors are the primary focal point of the Company&#8217;s sales strategy. Bollente is employing several outside manufacturers rep agencies to quickly scale sales and educate distributors, plumbers, builders, and contractors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company is also leveraging online marketing strategies and social media. By continually building an immersive and educational web experience at www.trutankless.com Bollente is efficiently building brand awareness among consumers. Launch efforts are focused in Arizona, Texas, and the Southeast which accounts for over 1,000,000 electric water heater shipments annually. Licensing and co-branding opportunities are being assessed, since strategic partnerships would eliminate the channel conflicts that have historically obstructed previous electric tankless entries in the marketplace. Electric tankless has traditionally not been able to warrant such partnerships because of generally poor quality and product support, but co-branding open up sales of Bollente&#8217;s products through big box retailers. 

In addition, we have determined that as part of our growth strategy, we will seek to partner with or acquire entities operating in various fields, with a bias towards green and "clean-tech" sectors. Our management has experience in marketing, product launches, business development strategies, and certain other areas specific to the success of growth companies. We will operate with a view towards identifying acquisition candidates as we seek the rights to provide the market with products and services geared toward environmental responsibility. 

We have identified several agents who are well suited to provide consulting to high-growth technology and consumer products companies. We are currently negotiating with several agents possessing technical expertise related to planning, structuring, and capitalizing growth companies in the green and "clean-tech" sectors who will be tasked with creating additional revenues and assist the Company with our own planning, structure, and capitalization. 

We have identified several entities that fit our criteria. We are focused on adding value to these companies and acquiring either the entity or its business, maintaining and growing that business, and hiring and utilizing existing management where appropriate. We have begun the design of a website which we believe will help us attract relationships with possible acquisition targets. 

Margin Expansion 

Cost reduction measures, including outsourcing of key components and certain quality control testing protocols, are currently being undertaken on an expedited basis to rapidly reduce costs and improve manufacturing scalability. Such reductions are expected to take place in stages over the next three quarters and are likely to result in gross sales margins approaching 50-60% which is far higher than other companies in the sector. 

Market Outlook 

Bollente is entering the market in front of the largest water heater replacement cycle ever at a time when homeowners are seeking ways reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing comfort. Shares of companies like Whirlpool (WHR) and AO Smith (AOS) have soared - fueled by the unprecedented Consumer Durables replacement cycle - which is an echo of last decade&#8217;s building boom. It is estimated that some 57 Million water heaters will need replacement in the next 3 years. Florida, Texas, and Arizona, where electric water heaters dominate the market, were the epicenters of the boom. In the new construction market, builders are increasingly marketing &#8220;green&#8221; features and trutankless fit well along with other energy saving innovations. In commercial markets, projects with a green designation like LEED or EnergyStar recently became the majority.&#8195; 

Additionally, the Federal Government has mandated that starting in April 2015 standard electric water heaters over 55 gallons may not be sold, effectively forcing the market to use alternative technologies like tankless water heaters. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Investment Analysis 

Bollente has entered the market with a disruptive product that has enjoyed significant tail winds thus far. As a result, we believe BOLC is poised to produce exceptional results. Management expects to announce several key partnerships outside of the wholesale channel for current products and launch several additional lines next year. Management has plans to significantly reduce the cost of goods sold and develop other innovations to supplement existing offerings which will be sold through the existing sales channels and reps which to help ensure sustainable growth over the next 3-5 years. 

Tankless Industry Overview 

The U.S. gas tankless, whole-house, water heater market is dominated by five brands; Noritz, Rinnai, Takagi, Aqua Star by Bosch and Rheem by Paloma. The U.S. electric tankless, whole-house, water heater market is dominated by four brands; Seisco by Microtherm, Inc., Stiebel Eltron, Eemax and Power Star by Bosch. Until just a few years ago, there were only a few tankless water heater manufacturers with a presence in the United States, but that is changing. Now, several Japanese and European manufacturers have begun marketing products in the United States, and since 2003, gas tankless products have experienced dramatic growth. Electric tankless systems have not experienced comparable growth due to several factors, primarily product performance, capacity, product quality and electrical power supply and installation issues. 

Manufacturers of tank heaters have a competitive advantage due largely to their product category&#8217;s long established use, name recognition, established distribution and brand position in the marketplace. Many plumbers and other building industry professionals were opposed to changing brands or to tankless systems because many tankless water heaters have been poorly designed in the past. As a result there is a perception among some contractors that these water heaters are more complicated and generally less dependable than traditional tank heaters. This perception is often passed along to consumers when making buying decisions or inquiring about switching to a tankless water heater. In recent years however, the industry has experienced a contraction in sales of products and services for new building projects. Consequently, higher ticket, higher margin products, such as tankless and solar water heating systems have become a primary growth driver for many plumbers and companies who had traditionally avoided emerging technologies. 

While we believe that our products will have superior performance, such as endless hot water, superior longevity, greater efficiency and lower &#8220;life-cycle&#8221; costs than traditional tank water heaters, the Company&#8217;s success will depend to a large degree on the successful conversion of traditional water heater buyers to tankless water heater buyers. The acquisition price of tankless water heaters (both gas and electric) is greater than traditional tank water heaters, but the overall cost of ownership will be less than that of traditional tank technologies under typical circumstances. Although the public&#8217;s awareness of tankless systems has not been strong historically, sales growth in the sector is suggestive of increasing awareness. 

Our marketing and promotion plans have been developed to increase the awareness of the Company&#8217;s brand as the preferred option to traditional tank systems. Bollente intends to position itself and its brand to capitalize on the paradigm shift to green-conscious living and development.

Target Markets 

The United States market for residential tank water heaters in 2010 was approximately 7.65 million units according to data released by the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). Almost 50% of those shipments were electric water heaters, and the company has found in comparing those statistics with government data, that over 90% of tank water heaters shipped in 2010 were intended for &#8220;replacement&#8221; installations. 

Bollente will initially market its products to builders, remodelers and distributors in the southern and western U.S. These areas of the country have been selected because of generally higher ground water temperatures, which improves the effects of the performance and capacity of all brands of tankless water heaters. This area of the country also traditionally has the largest share of population growth and new housing starts, accounting for almost two-thirds of all housing starts in 2010, according to government data. Additionally, the southern U.S., and specifically the southeastern U.S., has the highest usage of electric water heaters. 

Overview of Potential Markets and Summary of Marketing Plan 

Management intends to focus on the United States residential market initially. For decades Americans have used only tank type water heaters. For most homes, the units hold an average of 40 to 80 gallons of water in a storage tank, are gas or electric fueled and consume excessive energy to keep water hot continuously. In fact, water heaters expend up to 25% of the total energy used by a typical household representing the second largest use of energy in most homes. Depending on household usage, approximately 25 &#8211; 50% of the heat created is lost through the walls of the tank and connecting pipes. 

There are other problems inherent with traditional tank water heaters: 

&#183; 

Due to the high temperatures and corrosive aspects of water, a typical water heater has a life span of 10.7 years. 

&#183; 

Unless replaced beforehand, more than two thirds of water heaters eventually corrode and leak or burst, often resulting in extensive and costly water and mold related damage. 

&#183; 

Due to the large size and other installation requirements often result in the units being installed in garages and utility rooms on the opposite side of the home from the bathroom fixtures. Because of this, an estimated 10,000 gallons of water per household goes down the drain while users wait on the water to get hot at the faucet. 

&#183; 

Traditional tank water heaters take up to 6 to 9 square feet of floor space, which can be especially valuable in multi-family or commercial applications. 

&#183; 

To reduce operating costs, many people adjust the temperature on their water heaters down. Unfortunately, lower temperatures increase the possibility of unhealthy, water born bacteria growth. 

&#183; 

To increase water heating capacity, many people will adjust the temperature of their water heaters up . In addition to using more energy, this practice can be dangerous by posing a greater risk of scalding. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Tankless water heaters are becoming increasingly popular in America because they: 

&#183; 

Produce a continuous, unlimited supply of hot water 

&#183; 

Expend only the energy needed to heat the water used with no &#8220;standby&#8221; energy loss 

&#183; 

Can last more than twice as long as tank heaters 

&#183; 

Are small and require very little space. 

&#183; 

Are not conducive to bacterial growth 

&#183; 

Are considered very &#8220;green&#8221; by green conscious builders and consumers. 

Electric tankless water heaters have additional benefits over gas powered models because they can be installed almost anywhere in a home (closets, attics, utility rooms, etc.) where hot water is needed which improves flexibility of floor plan design for builders, architects, and remodelers. In addition, gas tankless water heaters may not be suitable for many applications due to challenges with adequate fuel supply, the need for exhaust vents with specific requirements, and other code-related requirements. In spite of these issues, gas tankless water heaters have enjoyed significant growth in North America because of the efficiency and performance they provide. 

Distribution Plan 

Initially, we will be distributing our first product line throughout the southern and western U.S. using an existing network of plumbing and electrical wholesalers (distributors), manufacturers&#8217; representatives and dealers. We believe that once the product has been launched, we will be able to partner with major companies in the building and plumbing industries to rapidly expand awareness of Bollente and our products in the water heater market in the U.S and Canada. 

Sales will be pursued through the following channels: 

1. 

Regional and national plumbing and electrical wholesalers (also called &#8220;distributors&#8221;); 

2. 

Plumbers and electricians on a direct basis, in those areas where wholesalers have not yet been set up; and, 

3. 

Builders on a direct basis, in those areas where wholesalers &#38; mechanical contractors have not yet been set up. 

We will expand sales of the product further by marketing the product directly to consumers over the internet with a series of aggressive and ongoing marketing initiatives. We intend to market to industry professionals and end-users through more traditional marketing efforts as well, including print advertising, attendance of select national trade shows, and attendance of select regional consumer shows. We also expect Bollente will be successful in providing education, training, and support to our sales and installer networks as part of our distribution and marketing efforts. 

We believe our products will be a differentiating factor for industry professionals and builders as they market to their customers. Additionally, our electric tankless products are expected to provide these professionals and their companies with a mechanism to increase revenue and improve gross margin as compared to more traditional water heating products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

We currently have nine full-time employees, including Robertson James Orr, who is also our sole officer and director, and two part-time employee. We expect to increase the number of employees to expand our sales and technical staff. We are using and will continue to use independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain operating and general expenses, and capital costs.
