&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

Superior Products &#8211; Our goal has always been to create the best products on the market. We develop all of our products in-house and take pride in creating quality applications. Our products stand out for their superior design, user-friendliness, ease of implementation, customizability, reliability, data speed, accuracy and comprehensiveness. 

&#160;

Custom Development &#8211; QuoteMedia's ability to provide complete custom design and development services differentiates us from our competitors. We are able to create custom market data applications and software engineered precisely to our clients' specifications, and the speed with which we are able to take a product from concept to deliverable truly sets us apart. 

&#160;

Data Speed and Quality &#8211; Our connections to the world's exchanges for equities and derivatives have most sources of latency removed. This allows us to deliver extremely fast, accurate, and reliable data. 

&#160;

Single Source Provider &#8211; Clients are eager to acquire premium market data feeds, financial applications, streaming solutions, and news and research information from a single source provider. Rather than having to license applications, information and market data from multiple sources, our clients enjoy the benefits of dealing with a single comprehensive market data supplier. 

&#160;

Cutting Edge Data Delivery Technology &#160;&#8211; We use state-of-the-art hardware and software systems for maximum speed and efficiency. This provides us with a distinct advantage over our competitors, most of whom use outdated data delivery technologies based on legacy style data networks.
