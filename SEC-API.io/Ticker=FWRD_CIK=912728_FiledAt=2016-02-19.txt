 Item 1. Business 

We were formed as a corporation under the laws of the State of Tennessee on October 23, 1981. Our operations can be broadly classified into three principal segments: Forward Air (&#8220;Forward Air&#8221;), Forward Air Solutions (&#8220;FASI&#8221;) and Total Quality ("TQI"). 

Through our Forward Air segment we provide time-definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the North American expedited ground freight market. Our licensed property broker utilizes qualified motor carriers, including our own, and other third-party transportation companies, to offer our customers local pick-up and delivery (Forward Air Complete&#174;) and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost-effective, reliable alternative to air transportation. We transport cargo that must be delivered at a specific time but is less time-sensitive than traditional air freight. This type of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as deferred air freight. We also offer our customers an array of logistics and other services including: expedited full truckload (&#8220;TLX&#8221;); dedicated fleets; warehousing; customs brokerage; and shipment consolidation, deconsolidation and handling. Also included in the Forward Air segment are the services performed by Central States Trucking Co. and Central States Logistics, Inc. (&#8220;CST&#8221;) which we acquired in 2014. CST provides intermodal drayage, devanning, transloading and warehousing services. 

FASI, which we formed in July 2007, provides pool distribution services throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest continental United States. Pool distribution involves managing high-frequency, last mile handling and distribution of time-sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions. Our primary customers for pool distribution are regional and nationwide distributors and specialty retailers, such as mall, strip mall and outlet-based retail chains. 

&#160; 

TQI, which we acquired in March 2013, provides maximum security and temperature-controlled logistics services, primarily truckload services, to the life sciences sector (pharmaceutical and biotechnology products). In addition to core pharmaceutical services and other cold chain services, TQI provides truckload and less-than-truckload brokerage transportation services. 

Growth Strategy 

Our strategy is to take advantage of our competitive strengths in order to increase our profits and shareholder returns. Our goal is to use our established businesses as the base from which to expand and launch new services that will allow us to grow and provide shareholder returns in changing economic environments. Principal components of our efforts include: 

&#32;3 

&#8226; 

Increase Freight Volume from Existing Customers. &#32;Many of our customers currently use us for only a portion of their overall transportation needs. We believe we can increase freight volumes from existing customers by offering more enhanced and comprehensive services that address all of the customer&#8217;s transportation needs, such as Forward Air Complete&#174; ("Complete"), our direct to door pick-up and delivery service and customer label integration. By offering additional services that can be integrated with our existing services, we believe we will attract additional business from existing customers. 

&#8226; 

Expand Service Offerings. We continue to expand our offered services to increase revenue and improve utilization of our terminal facilities and labor force. Because of the timing of the arrival and departure of cargo, our facilities are under-utilized during certain portions of the day, allowing us to add logistics services without significantly increasing our costs. Therefore, we have added a number of additional services in the past few years, such as TLX, pool distribution, temperature-controlled shipments, warehousing, drayage, customs brokerage and shipment consolidation and handling services. These services directly benefit our existing customers and increase our ability to attract new customers, particularly those customers that cannot justify providing the services directly. These services are not offered by many transportation providers with whom we compete and are attractive to customers who prefer to use one provider for all of their transportation needs. 

&#8226; 

Enhance Information Systems. &#32;We are committed to the continued development and enhancement of our information systems in ways that will continue to provide us competitive service advantages and increased productivity. We believe our enhanced systems have and will assist us in capitalizing on new business opportunities with existing customers and developing relationships with new customers. 

&#8226; 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions that can increase our penetration of a geographic area, add new customers, add new business verticals, and increase freight volume. In 2015, we completed the acquisition of CLP Towne Inc. ("Towne"). Towne is a full-service trucking provider offering time-sensitive less-than-truckload shipping, full truckload service, an extensive cartage network, container freight stations and dedicated trucking. The acquisition of Towne provides us with opportunities to expand our airport-to-airport service points and service offerings, such as pick up and delivery services. Additional benefits of the acquisition include increased linehaul network shipping density and a significant increase to our owner operator fleet, both of which are key to the profitability of Forward Air. Further, in 2014, we completed the acquisition of CST which later in 2014 acquired substanially all the assets of Recob Great Lakes Express, Inc. ("RGL") and Multi-Modal Trucking, Inc. and Multi-Modal Services, Inc. (together referred to as "MMT"). CST provides industry leading container and intermodal drayage services primarily within the Midwest region of the United States. CST also provides linehaul service within the airport-to-airport space as well as dedicated contract and Container Freight Station warehouse services. Acquisitions may affect our short-term cash flow and net income as we expend funds, potentially increase indebtedness and incur additional expenses. 

Competitive Advantages 

We believe that the following competitive advantages are critical to our success: 

&#8226; 

Focus on Specific Freight Markets and Concentrated Marketing Strategy. &#32;Our Forward Air segment focuses on providing time-definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the North American expedited ground freight market. Forward Air provides our expedited ground freight services mainly to freight forwarders, integrated air cargo carriers, and passenger and cargo airlines rather than directly serving shippers. We believe that Forward Air customers prefer to purchase their transportation services from us because, among other reasons, we generally do not market Forward Air&#8217;s services to their shipper customers and, therefore, do not compete directly with them for customers. Our FASI segment focuses on providing high-quality pool distribution services to retailers and nationwide distributors of retail products. Our TQI segment focuses on providing high-level security and temperature-controlled logistics services to the pharmaceutical and life science industries. This focused approach enables us to provide a higher level of service across all our business segments in a more cost-effective manner than our competitors. 

&#8226; 

Expansive Network of Terminals and Facilities. &#32;We have developed a network of terminals and facilities throughout the United States and Canada. We believe it would be difficult for a competitor to duplicate our network of facilities with the expertise and strategic facility locations we have acquired without expending significant capital and management resources. We believe that through our network of terminals and facilities we can offer our customers a variety of comprehensive, high-quality, consistent service across the majority of the continental United States. 

&#32;4 

&#8226; 

Superior Service Offerings. Forward Air&#8217;s published expedited ground freight schedule for transit times with specific cut-off and arrival times generally provides Forward Air customers with the predictability they need. In addition, our network of Forward Air terminals allows us to offer our Forward Air customers later cut-off times, a higher percentage of direct shipments (which reduces damage and shortens transit times) and earlier delivery times than most of our competitors. Our network of FASI terminals allows us the opportunity to provide precision deliveries to a wider range 

of locations than most pool distribution providers with increased on-time performance. TQI utilizes industry-leading temperature-controlled equipment, 24-hour real-time monitoring and tracking technology, and layered security features and practices to provide its customers with a level of service that is unmatched in the industry today. 

&#8226; 

Flexible Business Model. Rather than owning and operating our own large fleets of trucks, we purchase most of our transportation requirements from owner-operators or truckload carriers. This approach allows us to respond quickly to changing demands and opportunities in our industry and to generate strong returns on assets because of the lower capital requirements. 

&#8226; 

Comprehensive Logistic and Other Service Offerings. &#32;Through our three segments we offer an array of logistic and other services including: TLX, pick-up and delivery (Forward Air Complete&#8482;), pool distribution, temperature-controlled truckload, warehousing, customs brokerage and shipment consolidation and handling. These services are an essential part of many of our customers&#8217; transportation needs and are not offered by many of our competitors. We are often able to provide these services utilizing existing infrastructure and thereby earning additional revenue without incurring significant additional fixed costs. 

&#8226; 

Leading Technology Platform. &#32;We are committed to using information technology to improve our operations. Through improved information technology, we believe we can increase the volume of freight we handle in our networks, improve visibility of shipment information and reduce our operating costs. Our technology allows us to provide our customers with electronic bookings and real-time tracking and tracing of shipments while in our network, complete shipment history, proof of delivery, estimated charges and electronic bill presentment. We continue to enhance our systems to permit us and our customers to access vital information through both the Internet and electronic data interchange. We have continued to invest in information technology to the benefit of our customers and our business processes. 

&#8226; 

Strong Balance Sheet and Availability of Funding. Our asset-light business model and strong market position in the expedited ground freight market provides the foundation for operations that have produced excellent cash flow from operations even in challenging conditions. Our strong balance sheet and available borrowing capacity can also be a competitive advantage. Our competitors, particularly in the pool distribution market, are mainly regional and local operations, and may struggle to maintain operations in an uncertain economic environment. The threat of financial instability may encourage new and existing customers to use a more financially secure transportation provider. 

Operations 

The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our reportable segments: 

Forward Air 

Airport-to-airport 

&#160; 

We market our Forward Air airport-to-airport services primarily to freight forwarders, integrated air cargo carriers, and passenger and cargo airlines. To serve this market, we offer customers a high level of service with a focus on on-time, damage-free deliveries. We serve our customers by locating our terminals on or near airports in the United States and Canada and maintaining regularly scheduled transportation service between major cities. We either receive shipments at our terminals or if instructed to do so pick up shipments directly from our customers. We then transport the freight by truck (i) directly to the destination terminal; (ii) to our Columbus, Ohio central sorting facility; or (iii) to one of our 12 regional hubs, where they are unloaded, sorted and reloaded. After reloading the shipments, we deliver them to the terminals nearest their destinations and then, if requested by the customer, on to a final designated site. We ship freight directly between terminals when justified by the tonnage volume. 

During 2015, approximately 29.0% of the freight Forward Air handled was for overnight delivery, approximately 55.8% was for delivery within two to three days and the balance was for delivery in four or more days. Forward Air generally does not market its airport-to-airport services directly to shippers (where such services might compete with our freight forwarder customers). Also, because Forward Air does not place significant size or weight restrictions on airport-to-airport shipments, Forward Air generally does not compete directly with integrated air cargo carriers such as United Parcel Service and Federal Express in the overnight delivery of small parcels.

Independent agents operate 20 of our Forward Air locations. These locations typically handle lower volumes of freight relative to our Company-operated facilities. 

&#32;6 

Direct Service and Regional Hubs 

&#160; 

We operate direct terminal-to-terminal services and regional overnight service between terminals where justified by freight volumes. We currently provide regional overnight service to many of the markets within our network. Direct service allows us to provide quicker scheduled service at a lower cost because it allows us to minimize out-of-route miles and eliminate the added time and cost of handling the freight at our central or regional hub sorting facilities. Direct shipments also reduce the likelihood of damage because of reduced handling and sorting of the freight. As we continue to increase volume between various terminals, we intend to add other direct services. When warranted by sufficient volume in a region, we utilize larger terminals as regional sorting hubs, which allow us to bypass our Columbus, Ohio central sorting facility. These regional hubs improve our operating efficiency and enhance customer service. We operate regional hubs in Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Newark, Newburgh, Orlando, and Sacramento. 

Shipments 

The average weekly volume of freight moving through our airport-to-airport network was approximately 47.2 million pounds per week in 2015. During 2015, our average shipment weighed approximately 631 pounds and shipment sizes ranged from small boxes weighing only a few pounds to large shipments of several thousand pounds. Although we impose no significant size or weight restrictions, we focus our marketing and price structure on shipments of 200 pounds or more. As a result, we typically do not directly compete with integrated air cargo carriers in the overnight delivery of small parcels. The table below summarizes the average weekly volume of freight moving through our network for each year since 2001.

Forward Air Logistics and Other Services 

Forward Air customers increasingly demand more than the movement of freight from their transportation providers. To meet these demands, we continually seek ways to customize our logistics services and add new services. 

Our logistics and other services allow customers to access the following services from a single source: 

&#8226; 

expedited full truckload, or TLX; 

&#8226; 

intermodal drayage, or CST; 

&#8226; 

dedicated fleet; 

&#8226; 

customs brokerage, such as assistance with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (&#8220;U.S. Customs&#8221;) procedures for both import and export shipments; 

&#8226; 

warehousing, dock and office space; 

&#8226; 

hotshot or ad-hoc ultra expedited services; and 

&#32;7 

&#8226; 

shipment consolidation and handling, such as shipment build-up and break-down and reconsolidation of air or ocean pallets or containers. 

These services are critical to many of our customers that do not provide logistics services themselves or that prefer to use one provider for all of their surface transportation needs. 

Our logistics revenue is generated primarily by our TLX and intermodal drayage services. Our TLX service provides a high level of truckload service through a dedicated owner-operator fleet and third party transportation providers that allow for flexible capacity while also allowing us to cross utilize assets and capacity with our airport-to-airport fleet. 

In conjunction with our acquisition of CST in February 2014 and the related acquisitions of RGL and MMT, we expanded our container and intermodal drayage operations into the Midwest. We now offer container and intermodal drayage services in Charleston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Minneapolis. 

Forward Air Customers 

Our wholesale customer base is primarily comprised of freight forwarders, integrated air cargo carriers and passenger, cargo airlines and steamship lines. Forward Air's freight forwarder customers vary in size from small, independent, single facility companies to large, international logistics companies such as SEKO Worldwide, AIT Worldwide Logistics, Expeditors International of Washington, Associated Global, UPS Supply Chain Solutions, FedEx Corporation and Pilot Air Freight. Because we deliver dependable service, integrated air cargo carriers such as UPS Cargo, FedEx Corporation and DHL Worldwide Express use our network to provide overflow capacity and other services, including shipment of bigger packages and pallet-loaded cargo. Our passenger and cargo airline customers include United Airlines and Delta. In 2015, Forward Air&#8217;s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 37.0% of Forward Air&#8217;s operating revenue and no single customer accounted for more than 10.0% of Forward Air&#8217;s operating revenue. 

Forward Air Purchased Transportation 

Our licensed property broker places our customers&#8217; cargo with qualified motor carriers, including our own, and other third-party transportation companies. Forward Air's licensed motor carrier contracts with owner-operators for most of its transportation services. The owner-operators own, operate and maintain their own tractors and employ their own drivers. Our freight handlers load and unload our trailers and vehicles for hauling by owner-operators between our terminals. 

Forward Air seeks to establish long-term relationships with owner-operators to assure dependable service and availability. Historically, Forward Air has experienced significantly higher than industry average retention of owner-operators. Forward Air has established specific guidelines relating to safety records, driving experience and personal evaluations that we use to select our owner-operators. To enhance its relationship with the owner-operators, Forward Air rates are generally above prevailing market rates and we implemented rate increases at the beginning of 2015. In addition, our owner-operators and their drivers often are able to negotiate a consistent work schedule. Usually, owner-operators and their drivers also negotiate schedules that are between the same two cities or along a consistent route, improving quality of work life for the owner-operators and their drivers and, in turn, increasing our driver retention. 

As a result of efforts to expand our logistics and other services, seasonal demands and volume surges in particular markets, we also purchase transportation from other surface transportation providers to handle overflow volume. Of the $358.9 million incurred for Forward Air purchased transportation during 2015, we purchased 59.3% from the owner-operators of our licensed motor carrier and 40.7% from other surface transportation providers. 

Forward Air Competition 

The expedited ground freight segment of the transportation industry is highly competitive and very fragmented. Our competitors primarily include national and regional truckload and less-than-truckload carriers. To a lesser extent, Forward Air also competes with integrated air cargo carriers and passenger and cargo airlines. 

We believe competition in the expedited ground freight segment is based primarily on service, on-time delivery, flexibility and reliability, as well as rates. We offer our Forward Air services at rates that generally are significantly below the charge to transport the same shipment to the same destination by air. We believe Forward Air has an advantage over less-than-truckload carriers because Forward Air delivers faster, more reliable service between many cities. &#32; 

&#32;8 

Forward Air Solutions (FASI) 

Pool Distribution 

Through our FASI segment we provide pool distribution services through a network of terminals and service locations in 28 cities throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and Southwest continental United States. Pool distribution involves managing high-frequency handling and distribution of time-sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions. Our FASI pool distribution customers are primarily comprised of national and regional retailers and distributors, such as Stage Stores, The Limited, The Marmaxx Group and The GAP. FASI&#8217;s four largest customers accounted for approximately 62.8% of FASI&#8217;s 2015 operating revenue, but revenues from these four customers do not exceed 10.0% of our consolidated revenue. No other customers accounted for more than 10.0% of FASI&#8217;s operating revenue. 

Our pool distribution network consists of terminals and service locations in the following 28 cities:

FASI Transportation 

FASI provides transportation services through a mix of Company-employed drivers, owner-operators and third party carriers. The mix of sources utilized to provide FASI transportation services is dependent on the individual markets and related customer routes. During 2015, approximately 40.0% of FASI's direct transportation expenses were provided by Company-employed drivers, 32.4% by owner-operators and 27.6% was provided by third party carriers. 

FASI Competition 

The pool distribution segment of the transportation industry is also highly competitive and very fragmented. Our competitors primarily include regional and national truckload and less-than-truckload carriers. We believe FASI has an advantage over our competitors due to our presence in several regions across the continental United States allowing us to provide consistent, high-quality service to our customers regardless of location. 

Total Quality (TQI) 

TQI is a premium provider of high-level security and temperature-controlled services to the pharmaceutical and other life science industries. TQI utilizes industry-leading temperature-controlled equipment, 24-hour real-time monitoring and tracking technology and layered security features and practices to provide our customers with a high level of service. In addition to its core pharmaceutical services, TQI also provides truckload and less-than-truckload brokerage transportation services. TQI&#8217;s administrative headquarters are located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 

&#32;9 

TQI Transportation 

TQI maintains a fleet of Company-employed drivers and owner-operators. All Company-employed drivers and owner-operators are incentivized to follow strict operating procedures during pick up, transport and delivery. In addition to TQI&#8217;s private and owner-operator fleet, TQI has contracted third party partner carriers that have committed to meet TQI&#8217;s high standards of service and serve as a dedicated source of scalable capacity. Utilizing these partner carriers, TQI is able to accommodate spikes in demand created by product launches, product recalls, special promotions and other seasonal marketing efforts that require additional capacity. During 2015, approximately 34.5% of TQI's direct transportation expenses were provided by Company-employed drivers, 9.2% by owner-operators and 56.3% was provided by third party carriers. 

TQI Competition 

TQI competitors primarily include national and regional truckload carriers. We believe competition in TQI&#8217;s market is based primarily on quality service, on-time delivery and flexibility together with reliability and security. We believe TQI has a competitive advantage as a result of our superior technology and its established relationships with market leaders in the pharmaceutical and other life science industries. 

Marketing 

We market all our services through a sales and marketing staff located in major markets of the United States. Senior management also is actively involved in sales and marketing at the national account level and supports local sales initiatives. We also participate in air cargo and retail trade shows and advertise our services through direct mail programs and through the Internet via www.forwardair.com, &#32; www.forwardairsolutions.com, &#32; &#32; www.shiptqi.com &#32;and www.cstruck.com . The information contained on our websites is not part of this filing and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless such information is otherwise specifically referenced elsewhere in this report. 

Seasonality 

Historically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. The first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest. Typically, this pattern has been the result of factors such as economic conditions, customer demand, weather and national holidays. Additionally, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers whose business levels are impacted by the economy. The impact of seasonal trends and the economy is more pronounced on our pool distribution business. The pool distribution business is seasonal and operating revenues and results tend to improve in the third and fourth quarters compared to the first and second quarters.

As of December 31, 2015, we had 3,439 full-time employees, 2,226 of whom were freight handlers. Also, as of that date, we had an additional 1,097 part-time employees, of whom the majority were freight handlers. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We recognize that our workforce, including our freight handlers, is one of our most valuable assets. The recruitment, training and retention of qualified employees is essential to support our continued growth and to meet the service requirements of our customers. 

We own the majority of trailers we use to move freight through our networks. Substantially all of our trailers are 53&#8217; long, some of which have specialized roller bed equipment required to serve air cargo industry customers. At December 31, 2015, we had 4,234 owned trailers in our fleet with an average age of approximately 5.4 years. In addition, at December 31, 2014, we also had 1,089 leased trailers in our fleet. At December 31, 2015, we had 726 owned tractors and straight trucks in our fleet, with an average age of approximately 4.6 years. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we also had 185 leased tractors and straight trucks in our fleet. 

Risk Management and Litigation 

Under U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) regulations, we are liable for property damage and personal injuries caused by owner-operators and Company-employed drivers while they are operating on our behalf. We currently maintain liability insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover third-party claims. We have a self-insured retention of $0.5 million per occurrence for vehicle and general liability claims. We may also be subject to claims for workers&#8217; compensation. We maintain 

&#32;10 

workers&#8217; compensation insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover such claims. We have a self-insured retention of approximately $0.3 million for each such claim, except in Ohio, where we are a qualified self-insured entity with an approximately $0.5 million self-insured retention. We could incur claims in excess of our policy limits or incur claims not covered by our insurance. 

From time to time, we are a party to litigation arising in the normal course of our business, most of which involve claims for personal injury, property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight, or workers&#8217; compensation. We do not believe that any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Regulation 

The DOT and various state and federal agencies have been granted broad powers over our business. These entities generally regulate such activities as authorization to engage in property brokerage and motor carrier operations, safety and financial reporting. We are licensed through our subsidiaries by the DOT as a motor carrier and as a property broker to arrange for the transportation of freight by truck. Our domestic customs brokerage operations are licensed by U.S. Customs. We are subject to similar regulation in Canada.
