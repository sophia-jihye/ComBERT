We have a global manufacturing footprint and a technical service network to service our worldwide customer base. The global economies have a significant impact on the financial results of the business as we have significant operations outside of the United States. For an analysis of our revenue from sales to external customers, operating profit and assets by business segment, as well as revenues from sales to external customers and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of risks attendant to the global nature of our operations and assets, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

RAW MATERIALS 

The principal raw materials used to manufacture our products are various grades and forms of steel, from rolled steel bars, plates and sheets, to high-grade valve steel wires and sheets, various grades and forms (bars, sheets, forgings, castings and powders) of stainless steels, aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, copper alloys, graphite, and iron-based, nickel-based (Inconels) and cobalt-based (Hastelloys) superalloys for complex aerospace applications. Prices for steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys, as 

&#32;2 

well as other specialty materials, have periodically increased due to higher demand and, in some cases, reduction of the availability of materials. If this occurs, the availability of certain raw materials used by us or in products sold by us may be negatively impacted. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160; 

We conduct research and development activities in our effort to provide a continuous flow of innovative new products, processes and services to our customers. We also focus on continuing efforts aimed at discovering and implementing new knowledge that significantly improves existing products and services, and developing new applications for existing products and services. Our product development strategy is driven by product design teams and collaboration with our customers, particularly within Industrial&#8217;s Molding Solutions businesses, as well as within our Aerospace and our other Industrial businesses. Many of the products manufactured by us are custom parts made to customers&#8217; specifications. Investments in research and development are important to our long-term growth, enabling us to stay ahead of changing customer and marketplace needs. We spent approximately $ 13 &#32;million, $ 16 &#32;million and $ 15 &#32;million in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, on research and development activities.
