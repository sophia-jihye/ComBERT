 Item 1. Business. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST 

The Mesa Royalty Trust (the "Trust"), created under the laws of the State of Texas, maintains its offices at the office of the Trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., (the "Trustee"), 601 Travis Street, Floor 17, Houston, Texas 77002. The telephone number of the Trust is 713-483-6020. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., is the successor Trustee from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank and is the successor by mergers to the original name of the Trustee, Texas Commerce Bank National Association. 

The Trustee does not maintain a website for filings by the Trust with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Electronic filings by the Trust with the SEC are available free of charge through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . 

The Trust was created on November 1, 1979. On that date, Mesa Petroleum Co., predecessor to Mesa Limited Partnership ("MLP"), which was the predecessor to MESA Inc., conveyed to the Trust an overriding royalty interest (the "Royalty") equal to 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance and described below) attributable to the specified interests in properties conveyed by the assignor on that date (the "Subject Interests"). The Subject Interests consisted of interests in certain oil and gas properties located in the Hugoton field of Kansas, the San Juan Basin field of New Mexico and Colorado, and the Yellow Creek field of Wyoming (collectively, the "Royalty Properties"). The Royalty is evidenced by counterparts of an Overriding Royalty Conveyance dated as of November 1, 1979 (the "Conveyance"). On April 30, 1991, MLP sold its interests in the Royalty Properties located in the San Juan Basin field to ConocoPhillips, successor by merger to Conoco Inc. ("ConocoPhillips"). ConocoPhillips sold most of its interests in the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties located in Colorado to MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. (effective January 1, 1993) and Red Willow Production Company (effective April 1, 1992). On October 26, 1994, MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. sold substantially all of its interest in the Colorado San Juan Basin Royalty Properties to BP Amoco Company ("BP"), a subsidiary of BP p.l.c. Until August 7, 1997, MESA Inc. operated the Hugoton Royalty Properties through Mesa Operating Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of MESA Inc. On August 7, 1997, MESA Inc. merged with and into Pioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer"), formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of MESA Inc., and Parker &#38; Parsley Petroleum Company merged with and into Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. (successor to Mesa Operating Co.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pioneer ("PNR") (collectively, the mergers are referred to herein as the "Merger"). Subsequent to the Merger, the Hugoton Royalty Properties have been operated by PNR. Substantially all of the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties located in New Mexico are operated by ConocoPhillips. Effective January 1, 2005, ConocoPhillips assigned its interest in an immaterial number of San Juan Basin Royalty Properties located in New Mexico to XTO Energy Inc. Substantially all of the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties located in Colorado are operated by BP. As used in this report, Linn Energy Holdings, LLC ("Linn") refers to the operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties, ConocoPhillips refers to the operator of the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties, other than the portion of such properties located in Colorado, and BP refers to the operator of the Colorado San Juan Basin Royalty Properties, unless otherwise indicated. The terms "working interest owner" and "working interest owners" generally refer to the operators of the Royalty Properties as described above, unless the context in which such terms are used indicates otherwise. 

On July 18, 2014, PNR entered into a purchase and sale agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to sell all of its assets in the Hugoton field in Kansas to Linn. The transaction closed on September 11, 2014. The assets sold to Linn included, among other things, all of Pioneer's producing oil and gas wells, all of its interest in the Satanta gas processing plant and all other associated infrastructure. In connection with the Purchase Agreement, PNR and Linn also entered into a Transition Services 

Agreement, dated July 18, 2014, whereby PNR agreed to continue providing operating, certain administrative services, accounting and other services related to the assets in exchange for a service fee. As a result, PNR continued to act as operator with respect to the Hugoton Royalty Properties through December 31, 2014. Upon expiration of the Transition Services Agreement, Linn took over as operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties. 

The terms of the Mesa Royalty Trust Indenture (the "Trust Indenture") provide, among other things, that: (1) the Trust cannot engage in any business or investment activity or purchase any assets; (2) the Royalty can be sold in part or in total for cash upon approval by the unitholders; (3) the Trustee can establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust and can pledge the assets of the Trust to secure payment of the borrowings; (4) in January, April, July and October of each year the Trustee will make quarterly distributions of cash available for distribution to the unitholders; and (5) the Trust will terminate upon the first to occur of the following events: (i) at such time as the Trust's royalty income for two successive years is less than $250,000 per year or (ii) a vote by the unitholders in favor of termination. Royalty income of the Trust was $2,076,841 and $6,692,021 for the years 2015 and 2014, respectively. Upon termination of the Trust, the Trustee will sell for cash all the assets held in the Trust estate and make a final distribution to unitholders of any funds remaining after all Trust liabilities have been satisfied. 

Under the Conveyance, the Trust is entitled to payment of 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance), realized from Subject Minerals (as defined in the Conveyance), if and when produced from the Royalty Properties. See "Description of Royalty Properties." The Conveyance provides for a monthly computation of Net Proceeds. "Net Proceeds" is defined in the Conveyance as the excess of Gross Proceeds, received by the working interest owners during a particular period over operating and capital costs for such period. "Gross Proceeds" is defined in the Conveyance as the amount received by the working interest owners from the sale of Subject Minerals, subject to certain adjustments. Subject Minerals mean all oil, gas and other minerals, whether similar or dissimilar, in and under, and which may be produced, saved and sold from, and which accrue and are attributable to, the Subject Interests from and after November 1, 1979. Operating costs mean, generally, costs incurred on an accrual basis by the working interest owners in operating the Royalty Properties, including capital and non-capital costs. If operating and capital costs exceed Gross Proceeds for any month, the excess plus interest thereon at 120% of the prime rate of Bank of America is recovered out of future Gross Proceeds prior to the making of further payment to the Trust. The Trust, however, is generally not liable for any operating costs or other costs or liabilities attributable to the Royalty Properties or minerals produced therefrom. The Trust is not obligated to return any royalty income received in any period. The working interest owners are required to maintain books and records sufficient to determine the amounts payable under the Royalty. Additionally, in the event of a controversy between a working interest owner and any purchaser as to the correct sales price for any production, amounts received by such working interest owner and promptly deposited by it with an escrow agent are not considered to have been received by such working interest owner and therefore are not subject to being payable with respect to the Royalty until the controversy is resolved; but all amounts thereafter paid to such working interest owner by the escrow agent will be considered amounts received from the sale of production. Similarly, operating costs include any amounts a working interest owner is required to pay whether as a refund, interest or penalty to any purchaser because the amount initially received by such working interest owner as the sales price was in excess of that permitted by the terms of any applicable contract, statute, regulation, order, decree or other obligation. Within 30 days following the close of each calendar quarter, the working interest owners are required to deliver to the Trustee a statement of the computation of Net Proceeds attributable to such quarter. 

The brief discussions of the Trust Indenture and the Conveyance contained herein are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Trust Indenture and the Conveyance themselves, which are exhibits to this Form 10-K and are available upon request from the Trustee. 

The Royalty Properties are required to be operated by the working interest owners in accordance with reasonable and prudent business judgment and good oil and gas field practices. Each working interest owner has the right to abandon any well or lease if, in its opinion, such well or lease ceases to produce or is not capable of producing oil, gas or other minerals in commercial quantities. Each working interest owner markets the production on terms deemed by it to be the best reasonably obtainable in the circumstances. See "Contracts." The Trustee has no power or authority to exercise any control over the operation of the Royalty Properties or the marketing of production therefrom. 

In 1985, the Trust Indenture was amended at a special meeting of unitholders and the Trust conveyed to an affiliate of Mesa Petroleum Co. 88.56% of the original Royalty (such transfer, the "1985 Assignment"). The effect of the 1985 Assignment was an overall reduction of approximately 88.56% in the size of the Trust, distributable income and related Trust reserves, effective April 1, 1985. See Note 2 in the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

The Trust has no employees. Administrative functions of the Trust are performed by the Trustee. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE UNITS 

Each unit is evidenced by a transferable certificate issued by the Trustee. Each unit ranks equally for purposes of distributions and has one vote on any matter submitted to unitholders. A total of 1,863,590 units were outstanding at March 30, 2016. 

Distributions 

The Trustee determines for each month the amount of cash available for distribution for such month. Such amount (the "Monthly Distribution Amount") consists of the cash received from the Royalty during such month less the obligations of the Trust paid during such month, adjusted for changes made by the Trustee during such month in any cash reserves established for the payment of contingent or future obligations of the Trust. The Monthly Distribution Amount for each month is payable to unitholders of record on the monthly record date (the "Monthly Record Date"), which is the close of business on the last business day of such month or such other date as the Trustee determines is required to comply with legal or stock exchange requirements. However, to reduce the administrative expenses of the Trust, under the Trust Indenture the Trustee does not distribute cash monthly, but rather, during January, April, July and October of each year distributes to each person who was a unitholder of record on one or more of the immediately preceding three Monthly Record Dates, the Monthly Distribution Amount for the month or months that he was a unitholder of record, together with interest earned on such Monthly Distribution Amount from the Monthly Record Date to the payment date. Under the terms of the Trust Indenture, interest is earned at a rate of 1 1 / 2 % below the prime rate charged by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., successor from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (as the successor by mergers to the original name of the Trustee, Texas Commerce Bank National Association) or the interest rate which The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., pays in the normal course of business on amounts placed with it, whichever is greater. Interest income may vary significantly across different payment dates. 

As of December 31, 2015, there were $6,739 of unreimbursed expenses. The Trust anticipated receipt of these expense reimbursements by month-end when it published its December distribution press release on December 17, 2015, and included these amounts in distributions payable and distributable income per unit as of December 31, 2015. 

The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that the Trustee may establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust and may pledge assets of the Trust to secure payment of the borrowings. During 2011, the Trustee withheld $1.0 million for future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses in accordance with the Trust Indenture. At any given time, the amount currently reserved for such future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses is included in 

cash and short-term investments. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Trustee decreased the reserve for future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses by the amount of expected expense reimbursement cash receipts of $180,865. Additionally, the Trustee increased the reserve for future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses by the amounts received during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 related to expense reimbursement cash receipts for previous periods totaling $174,126. As of December 31, 2015, the reserve for unknown contingent liabilities and expenses was $993,261, which was included in cash and short term investments. The Trust has subsequently received $6,739 of the expected expense reimbursement cash receipts as of January 31, 2016, which has increased the reserve for unknown contingent liabilities and expenses. The Trustee reserves the right to determine whether or not to release cash reserves in future periods with respect to any unreimbursed expenses. 

Liability of Unitholders 

In regards to the unitholders, the Trustee is fully liable if the Trustee incurs any liability without ensuring that such liability will be satisfiable only out of the Trust assets (regardless of whether the assets are adequate to satisfy the liability) and in no event out of amounts distributed to, or other assets owned by, unitholders. However, under Texas law, it is unclear whether a unitholder would be jointly and severally liable for any liability of the Trust in the event that all of the following conditions were to occur: (1) the satisfaction of such liability was not by contract limited to the assets of the Trust, (2) the assets of the Trust were insufficient to discharge such liability and (3) the assets of the Trustee were insufficient to discharge such liability. Although each unitholder should weigh this potential exposure in deciding whether to retain or transfer his units, the Trustee is of the opinion that because of the passive nature of the Trust assets, the restrictions on the power of the Trustee to incur liabilities and the required financial net worth of any trustee, the imposition of any liability on a unitholder is extremely unlikely. 

Federal Income Tax Matters 

This section is a summary of federal income tax matters of general application which addresses the material tax consequences of the ownership and sale of the units. Except where indicated, the discussion below describes general federal income tax considerations applicable to individuals who are citizens or residents of the United States. Accordingly, the following discussion has limited application to domestic corporations and persons subject to specialized federal income tax treatment, such as regulated investment companies and insurance companies. It is impractical to comment on all aspects of federal, state, local and foreign laws that may affect the tax consequences of the transactions contemplated hereby and of an investment in the units as they relate to the particular circumstances of every unitholder. Each unitholder is encouraged to consult its own tax advisor with respect to its particular circumstances. 

This summary is based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), existing and proposed Treasury Regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to changes that may or may not be retroactively applied. Some of the applicable provisions of the Code have not been interpreted by the courts or the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). No assurance can be provided that the statements set forth herein (which do not bind the IRS or the courts) will not be challenged by the IRS or will be sustained by a court if so challenged. 

Classification of the Trust 

In a technical advice memorandum dated February 26, 1982, the National Office of the IRS advised the Dallas District Director that the Trust is classifiable as a grantor trust and not as an association taxable as a corporation. As a grantor trust, the Trust incurs no federal income tax liability 

and each unitholder is subject to tax on the unitholder's pro rata share of the income and expense of the Trust as if the unitholder were the direct owner of a pro rata share of the Trust's assets. 

The Trustee assumes that some Trust units are held by a middleman, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a custodian in street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust ("WHFIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 601 Travis Street, Floor 17, Houston, Texas 77002, telephone number 713-483-6020, is the representative of the Trust that will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding units on behalf of unitholders, and not the Trustee of the Trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the Treasury Regulations with respect to such units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Unitholders whose units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the units. 

Income and Depletion 

Royalty income, net of depletion and severance taxes, is portfolio income. Subject to certain exceptions and transitional rules, royalty income cannot be offset by passive losses. Additionally, interest income is portfolio income. Administrative expense is an investment expense. 

Generally, prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, the transferee of an oil and gas property could not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property if it was "proved" at the time of the transfer. This rule is not applicable in the case of transfers of properties after October 11, 1990. Thus, eligible unitholders who acquired units after that date are entitled to claim an allowance for percentage depletion with respect to royalty income attributable to these units to the extent that this allowance exceeds cost depletion as computed for the relevant period. 

Backup Withholding 

Distributions from the Trust are generally subject to backup withholding at a rate of 28%. Backup withholding will not normally apply to distributions to a unitholder, however, unless the unitholder fails to properly provide to the Trust his taxpayer identification number or the IRS notifies the Trust that the taxpayer identification number provided by the unitholder is incorrect. 

Sale of Units 

Generally, except for recapture items, the sale, exchange or other disposition of a unit will result in capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the tax basis in the unit and the amount realized. Effective for property placed in service after December 31, 1986, the amount of gain, if any, realized upon the disposition of oil and gas property is treated as ordinary income up to the amount of intangible drilling and development costs incurred with respect to the property and depletion claimed to the extent it reduced the taxpayer's basis in the property. Under this provision, depletion attributable to a unit acquired after 1986 will be subject to recapture as ordinary income upon disposition of the unit or upon disposition of the oil and gas property to which the depletion is attributable. The balance of any gain or any loss will be capital gain or loss if the unit was held by the unitholder as a capital asset, either long-term or short-term depending on the holding period of the unit. This capital gain or loss will be long-term if a unitholder's holding period exceeds one year at the time of sale or exchange. Under current law, the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long-term capital gains of individuals is 20%. Moreover, this rate is subject to change by new legislation at any time. The 

deductibility of capital losses are subject to certain limitations. Capital gain or loss will be short-term if the unit has not been held for more than one year at the time of sale or exchange. 

Additional Tax on Net Investment Income 

Individuals, estates, and trusts with income above certain thresholds are subject under Section 1411 of the Code to an additional 3.8% tax&#151;also known as the Net Investment Income Tax ("NIIT")&#151;on their net investment income. Grantor trusts such as Mesa Royalty Trust are not subject to the NIIT; however, the unitholders may be subject to the tax. For these purposes, investment income would generally include certain income derived from investments, such as the royalty income derived from the units and gain realized by a unitholder from a sale of units. 

Non-U.S. Unitholders 

In general, a unitholder who is a nonresident alien individual or which is a foreign corporation, each a "non-U.S. unitholder" for purposes of this discussion, will be subject to tax on the gross income (without taking into account any deductions, such as depletion) produced by the Royalty at a rate equal to 30% or, if applicable, at a lower treaty rate. This tax will be withheld by the Trustee and remitted directly to the United States Treasury. A non-U.S. unitholder may elect to treat the income from the Royalty as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business under provisions of the Code or pursuant to any similar provisions of applicable treaties. Upon making this election, a non-U.S. unitholder is entitled to claim all deductions with respect to that income, but he must file a United States federal income tax return to claim these deductions. This election once made is irrevocable unless an applicable treaty allows the election to be made annually. 

The Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder treat the publicly traded Trust as if it were a United States real property holding corporation. Accordingly, a non-U.S. unitholder may be subject to United States federal income tax on the gain on the disposition of his units if he meets certain ownership thresholds. 

In addition, if a foreign corporation elects under provisions of the Code to treat the income from the Royalty as effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business, the corporation may also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax at a rate of 30%. This tax is imposed on U.S. branch profits of a foreign corporation that are not reinvested in the U.S. trade or business. This tax is in addition to the tax on effectively connected income. The branch profits tax may be either reduced or eliminated by treaty. Federal income taxation of a non-U.S. unitholder is a highly complex matter which may be affected by many considerations. Therefore, each non-U.S. unitholder is encouraged to consult with his own tax advisor with respect to its ownership of units. 

Pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly referred to as "FATCA"), distributions from the Trust to "foreign financial institutions" and certain other "non-financial foreign entities" may be subject to U.S. withholding taxes. Specifically, certain "withholdable payments" (including certain royalties, interest and other gains or income from U.S. sources) made to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity will generally be subject to the withholding tax unless the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related requirements imposed by FATCA. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules. Foreign unitholders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding provisions on their investment in Trust units. 

Tax-Exempt Organizations 

The Royalty and interest income should not be unrelated business taxable income so long as, generally, a unitholder did not incur debt to acquire a unit or otherwise incur or maintain a debt that would not have been incurred or maintained if the unit had not been acquired. Legislative proposals have been made from time to time which, if adopted, would result in the treatment of Royalty income as unrelated business taxable income. Each tax-exempt unitholder is encouraged to consult its own advisor with respect to the treatment of royalty income. 

DESCRIPTION OF ROYALTY PROPERTIES

&#160; &#160; Producing Acres(1) &#160; Producing Gas Wells(1) &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross &#160; Net &#160; Gross &#160; Net &#160; Hugoton Area (Kansas) &#160; &#160; 99,654 &#160; &#160; 99,413 &#160; &#160; 469 &#160; &#160; 408 &#160; San Juan Basin (Northwestern New Mexico and Southwestern Colorado) &#160; &#160; 40,716 &#160; &#160; 31,328 &#160; &#160; 3,005 &#160; &#160; 335 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 140,370 &#160; &#160; 130,741 &#160; &#160; 3,474 &#160; &#160; 743 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(1) The Trust does not have a working interest in the producing acres and producing gas wells. The gross and net amounts in the table above represent gross and net amounts attributable to the working interest owners and are the basis for the Gross Proceeds amounts discussed under "Description of the Trust." 

Hugoton Field 

The principal property interest conveyed to the Trust accounts was carved out of Linn's working interest in 104,437 net producing acres in the Hugoton field. The life of the field is expected to extend beyond the year 2039. 

The gas produced from the Hugoton properties is available for sale on the spot market. See "Contracts." Since the Hugoton field gas is sold in the intrastate and interstate markets, it is subject to state and federal laws and regulations. The Kansas Corporation Commission (the "KCC") is the state regulatory agency responsible for overseeing oil and gas operations in the state of Kansas. Hugoton field gas is also affected by the rules and regulations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"). See "Regulation and Prices." 

San Juan Basin 

The Trust's interest in the San Juan Basin was conveyed from PNR's working interest in 31,328 net producing acres in Northwestern New Mexico and Southwestern Colorado. PNR completed the sale of its underlying interest in the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties to ConocoPhillips on April 30, 1991. Substantially all of the natural gas produced from the San Juan Basin is currently being sold on the spot market. ConocoPhillips subsequently sold its underlying interest in substantially all of the Colorado portion of the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties to MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. (effective January 1, 1993) and Red Willow Production Company (effective April 1, 1992). On October 26, 1994, MarkWest Energy Partners, Ltd. sold substantially all of its interest in the Colorado San Juan Basin Royalty Properties to BP. Effective January 1, 2005, ConocoPhillips assigned its interest in an immaterial number of San Juan Basin Royalty Properties located in New Mexico to XTO Energy Inc. See "Description of the Trust" under Item 1 of this Form 10-K. 

Drilling 

There were no exploratory wells drilled on the Royalty Properties during 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

Reserves 

A study of the proved Hugoton Area and San Juan Basin oil and gas reserves attributable to the Trust has been made by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineering consultants, as of December 31, 2015. A copy of this Reserve Report has been filed as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K. DeGolyer and MacNaughton is a Delaware corporation with offices in Dallas, Houston, Calgary, Moscow and Algiers. The firm's more than 100 professionals include engineers, geologists, geophysicists, petrophysicists, and economists engaged in the appraisal of oil and gas properties, evaluation of hydrocarbon and other mineral prospects, basin evaluations, comprehensive field studies, and equity studies related to the domestic and international energy industry. These services have been provided for over 70 years. DeGolyer and MacNaughton restricts its activities exclusively to consultation; it does not accept contingency fees, nor does it own operating interests in any oil, gas, or mineral properties, or securities or notes of clients. The firm subscribes to a code of professional conduct, and its employees actively support their related technical and professional societies. In serving the petroleum industry and financial community, the firm's experienced staff provides knowledge, independent judgment, integrity, and confidential service to its clients. The firm is a Texas Registered Engineering Firm, No. F-716. 

The Senior Vice President at DeGolyer and MacNaughton primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates is a Registered Petroleum Engineer in the State of Texas with more than 40 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and reserve evaluations. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Texas A&#38;M University in 1974 and he is a member of the International Society of Petroleum Engineers and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists. 

The Hugoton Area and San Juan Basin Reserve Report reflects estimated production, reserve quantities and future net revenue based upon estimates of the future timing of actual production without regard to when received in cash by the Trust, which differs from the manner in which the Trust recognizes and accounts for its Royalty income. 

Estimates of the gross and net proved reserves, as of December 31, 2015, of the Trust's ownership in the overriding royalty interest are presented below. Total liquid reserves (condensate and natural gas liquids) are expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl) and gas reserves are expressed in thousands of cubic feet (Mcf).

(1) Future income tax expenses were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates. 

Please read "Summary Reserve Report from DeGolyer and MacNaughton" attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 for more information. 

The Reserve Report was delivered to the Trustee on February 22, 2016. Net reserves of the Trust's Royalty are calculated at the aggregate level from the net revenue of each of the Working Interest Owners. To estimate net gas reserves, the total net revenue is divided by the net value of 1 Mcf of gas. The net value of 1 Mcf of gas is the gas price per Mcf, plus the condensate value per Mcf of gas, plus the NGL value per Mcf of gas. The net condensate and NGL reserves are calculated by multiplying their respective yields by the net gas reserves. Revenue values used in the Reserve Report were estimated using the following prices: (1) condensate prices&#151;$40.49 per Bbl; (2) NGL prices&#151;$16.87 per Bbl for San Juan properties, $14.06 per Bbl for Hugoton properties; and (3) natural gas prices&#151;$2.26 per Mcf for San Juan properties, 3.50 per Mcf for Hugoton properties, with the initial prices also used as weighted average prices held constant thereafter over the lives of the properties. Estimates of operating expenses were based on current expenses and used for the life of the properties with no increases in the future based on inflation. 

Preparation of Reserve Estimates 

For further information regarding the Net Overriding Royalty Interest, the Basis of Accounting and Supplemental Reserve Information, see Notes 2, 3 and 9, respectively, in the Notes to Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the producer. Reserve data included above and in these reports represent estimates only and should not be construed as being exact. The discounted present values shown by the reserve reports should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated gas and oil reserves attributable to the Royalty Properties or the costs that would be incurred to obtain equivalent reserves, since a market value determination would include many additional factors. 

The Trustee has been advised that each of the foregoing estimates were prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"). Accordingly, the estimates are based on existing economic and operating conditions in effect at December 31, 2015, with no provision for future increases or decreases except for periodic price redeterminations in accordance with existing gas contracts. Actual future prices and costs may be materially greater or less than the assumed amounts in the reserve reports. Because the reserve reports are limited to proved reserves, future capital expenditures for recovery of reserves not classified as proved are not included in the calculation of estimated future net revenues. Reserve assessment is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way, and estimates of other persons might differ materially from those of DeGolyer and MacNaughton. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of hydrocarbons that are ultimately recovered. 

The Trustee relies on DeGolyer and MacNaughton to prepare the reserve estimated attributable to the Trust's interests in the Royalty Properties. Although the Trustee inquires with the third-party reserve engineer about the information provided by the working interest owners and the assumptions made and methodologies used by the third-party reserve engineer, the Trustee does not control the information provided by the working interest owners or the assumptions made or methodologies used by the third-party reserve engineer. Accordingly, such information is outside the scope of the internal controls of the Trust and the Trustee. 

As noted in this report, the Trustee is currently investigating certain payments and differences from original estimates. The Trustee is also reviewing, with the assistance of outside experts, prior allocations of payments of Royalty income by the working interest owners. Any past practices not consistent with the Conveyance could also cause the basis for the reserve estimates included above to differ from actual reserve quantities and future net revenues. 

Income, Production and Production Prices and Production Costs 

Reference is made to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Summary of Royalty Income, Production, Prices and Costs" under Item 7 of this Form 10-K for information concerning income, production, production prices and costs with respect to the Royalty. 

CONTRACTS 

Hugoton Field 

Natural gas and natural gas liquids produced by Linn from the Hugoton field and attributable to the Royalty accounted for approximately 43% of the Royalty income of the Trust during 2015. 

Linn has advised the Trust that since June 1, 1995 natural gas produced from the Hugoton field has generally been sold under short-term and multi-month contracts at market clearing prices to multiple purchasers. During 2015, the primary purchasers were Kansas Gas Service, Continuum Energy Service, LLC and Enterprise Products Operating, LLC. Linn has advised the Trust that it expects to continue to market gas production from the Hugoton field under short-term and multi-month contracts. Overall market prices received for natural gas from Hugoton Royalty Properties were lower for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. 

In June 1994, PNR entered into a Gas Transportation Agreement ("Gas Transportation Agreement") with Western Resources, Inc. ("WRI") for a primary term of five years, commencing June 1, 1995. Thereafter, this contract has renewed on a year to year basis. WRI subsequently assigned its rights and obligations under the Gas Transportation Agreement to Oneok Field Services ("Oneok"), and PNR subsequently assigned its rights and obligations under the Gas Transportation Agreement to 

Linn. The current term will remain in effect through May 31, 2016, at which point Oneok has provided notice to terminate. In their termination notice issued May 12, 2015, Oneok noted they were agreeable to negotiating a new agreement in order to continue to provide gathering and compression service. On January 1, 2016, Linn Midstream acquired the gathering line from Oneok. Oneok will continue to provide compression under a new Gas Compression Agreement effective January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, and then month-to-month thereafter, at a rate of $.13 per Mcf, to be escalated beginning April 1, 2017, and annually each April 1 thereafter using the Consumer Price Index. Linn Midstream will provide gathering services under a new Gas Gathering Agreement effective January 1, 2016, under a three year agreement that continues month-to-month thereafter, at a rate of $.06 per Mcf, to be escalated beginning April 1, 2017, and annually each April 1 thereafter using the Consumer Price Index. 

Pursuant to the terms of the Gas Transportation Agreement, WRI initially agreed to compress and transport up to 160 MMcf per day of gas and redeliver such gas to PNR at the inlet of PNR's Satanta Plant. PNR agreed to pay WRI a fee of $0.06 per Mcf escalating 4% annually as of June 1, 1996. Beginning July 1, 2007, the Hugoton and Panoma fields are considered a single, common source of supply and operate under a single combined Basic Proration Order ("BPO"). After July 1, 2007, the wells in each of these fields are allowed to produce at their open flow potential and will no longer be subject to allowable restrictions and any and all overage or underage that a well may have accrued will be cancelled. 

San Juan Basin 

Natural gas, oil, condensate and natural gas liquids produced from the San Juan Basin field and attributable to the Royalty accounted for approximately 55% of the Royalty income of the Trust during 2015. The majority of gas produced from the San Juan Basin is now being sold on the spot market. 

Market for Natural Gas 

The amount of cash distributions by the Trust is dependent on, among other things, the sales prices for natural gas produced from the Royalty Properties and the quantities of gas sold. The Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices were $3.73 per mcf in 2013, increased to $4.37 per mcf in 2014 and decreased to $2.62 per mcf in 2015 according to the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. Due to the seasonal nature of demand for natural gas and its effects on sales prices and production volumes, the amounts of cash distributions by the Trust may vary substantially on a seasonal basis. Generally, production volumes and prices are higher during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year due primarily to peak demand in these periods. Because of the time lag between the date on which the working interest owners receive payment for production from the Royalty Properties and the date on which distributions are made to unitholders, the seasonality that generally affects production volumes and prices is generally reflected in distributions to unitholders in later periods. 

Competition 

The production and sale of gas in the Hugoton field and San Juan Basin areas are highly competitive, and the working interest owners' competitors in these areas include the major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, and individual producers and operators. There are numerous producers in the Hugoton field and the San Juan Basin areas. The working interest owners have advised the Trust that they believe that their competitive position in their respective areas is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service. Linn has also advised the Trust that it believes that its competitive position in the Hugoton field is enhanced by virtue of its substantial holdings and ownership and control of its wells, gathering systems and processing plant. Market conditions in the San Juan Basin are negatively affected by the fact that most of the gas produced from such areas is 

transported on one of only two major pipelines, and the transportation of such gas is generally controlled by a small number of distribution companies. 

REGULATION AND PRICES 

General 

The production and sale of natural gas from the Royalty Properties are affected from time to time in varying degrees by political developments and federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and gas production operations and economics are, or in the past have been, affected by price controls, taxes, conservation, safety, environmental and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, by changes in such laws and by constantly changing administrative regulations. 

FERC Regulation 

In general, the FERC regulates the sale of natural gas in interstate commerce for resale and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce by interstate pipelines. The FERC adopted regulations resulting in a restructuring of the natural gas industry. The principal elements of this restructuring were the requirement that interstate pipelines separate, or "unbundle," into individual components the various services offered on their systems, with all transportation services to be provided on a non-discriminatory basis, and the prohibition against an interstate pipeline providing gas sales services except through separately-organized affiliates. In various rulemaking proceedings following its initial unbundling requirement, the FERC has refined its regulatory program applicable to interstate pipelines in various respects, and it has announced that it will continue to monitor these and other regulations to determine whether further changes are needed. In addition to rulemaking proceedings, the FERC establishes new policies and regulations through policy statements and adjudications of individual pipeline matters. Further, additional changes to regulations may occur based on actions taken by the United States Congress and/or the courts. As to these various developments, the working interest owners have advised the Trust that the on-going and evolving nature of these regulatory initiatives makes it impossible to predict their ultimate impact on the prices, markets or terms of sale of natural gas related to the Trust. 

In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act that removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. 

Sales of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is subject to rate and access regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be just and reasonable and may be derived in a number of ways including, but not limited to, the FERC's indexing methodology. 

As to these various types of regulation, the on-going and evolving nature of these regulatory initiatives makes it impossible to predict their ultimate impact on the prices, markets or terms of sale of natural gas related to the Trust. 

State and Other Regulation 

All of the jurisdictions in which the Trust has an interest in producing oil and gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas. The regulations 

often require permits for the drilling of wells but extend also to the spacing of wells, the prevention of waste of oil and gas resources, the rate of production, prevention and clean-up of pollution and other matters. See "Contracts&#151;Hugoton Field" for a discussion of PNR's allowables in the Hugoton Royalty Properties. 

State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, non-discriminatory take requirements. For example, Oklahoma and Kansas have enacted a prohibition against discriminatory gathering rates. In addition, certain Texas regulatory officials have expressed interest in evaluating similar rules, but to date no actions have been taken towards regulatory gathering rates in the state. 

Natural gas pipeline facilities used for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce are subject to Federal minimum safety requirements. These requirements, however, are not applicable to, inter alia , (1) onshore gathering facilities outside (i) the limits of any incorporated or unincorporated city, town, or village, and (ii) any designated residential or commercial area; or (2) pipeline facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf ("OCS") upstream of the point at which operating responsibility transfers from a producing operator to a transporting operator. See 49 C.F.R. &#167; 192.1(b). We are informed that the Royalty Properties are located in the Hugoton field in Kansas, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado, and the Yellow Creek field of Wyoming. Furthermore, those states have adopted the Federal minimum safety requirements for intrastate pipelines within their borders. The standards governing pipeline safety have undergone recent changes and it is possible that future changes in the regulations and statutes may occur which may increase the stringency of the standards or expand the applicability of the standards to facilities not currently covered. 

Environmental Matters 

The working interest owners' operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations, including their state counterparts, can impose liability upon the owner, operator or lessee under a lease for the cost of cleanup of discharged materials or damages to natural resources resulting from oil and gas operations. These laws and regulations may, among other things: 

&#149; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; &#149; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and &#149; require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells. Violations of environmental laws, regulations, or permits can result in civil and criminal penalties as well as potential injunctions curtailing operations in affected areas. The working interest owners have advised the Trust that they are not at this time involved in any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Royalty Properties arising under federal, state or local environmental protection laws and regulations or which would have a material adverse effect on the working interest owners' financial position or results of operations. The working interest owners have also advised the Trust that they maintain insurance for costs of cleanup obligations, but that they are not fully insured against all such risks. 

The following is a summary of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which the operations of the properties comprising the underlying properties may be subject that are material to the operation of the Royalty Properties. 

Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as "CERCLA" or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, potentially without regard to fault or legality of the activity at the time, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of health studies. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 

The properties comprising the Royalty Properties may have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although the working interest owners believe that they have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, the properties comprising the Royalty Properties may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under the working interest owners' control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, federal hazardous waste laws, and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the working interest owners could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination. 

In addition, in the course of the working interest owner's operations, equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials, or "NORM." NORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements. Because some properties presently or previously comprising the Royalty Properties may have been used for oil and natural gas production operations for many years, it is possible that the working interest owners may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM. 

Waste Handling. The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as "RCRA," and comparable state statutes, regulate the management and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Some wastes associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are exempted from the most stringent regulation in certain circumstances, such as drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas. However, these wastes and other wastes may be otherwise regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") or state agencies. Moreover, in the ordinary course of oil and gas operations, industrial wastes such as paint wastes and waste solvents may be regulated as hazardous waste under RCRA or considered hazardous substances under CERCLA. It is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. 

Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into regulated waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the "OPA"), as amended, which amends the Clean Water Act, imposes strict liability on owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into regulated waters. The OPA and its associated regulations impose a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention 

of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal or state law may require appropriate operating protocols, including containment berms and similar structures, to help prevent or respond to a petroleum hydrocarbon spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws may require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities or during construction activities. 

Hydraulic Fracturing. It is customary to recover oil and natural gas from deep shale, tight sand and coal bed formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Conventional hydraulic fracturing techniques are used to increase production in vertical wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing activities from the definition of "underground injection." At present, hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the state and local level. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal, state and local level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Repeal of the exemption would allow the EPA to promulgate new regulations. Many states have adopted rules that required operators to disclose chemicals and water volumes associated with hydraulic fracturing. In addition, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities and issued a draft report in June 2015 for public review. 

Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including drilling operations and related equipment, and as a result affect oil and natural gas operations. The EPA has also developed, and continues to give attention to, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and gas operations. Air emissions permits may be required for some oil and gas production operations. 

Climate Change. In the recent Congressional session, numerous legislative measures were introduced that would have imposed restrictions or costs on greenhouse gas emissions, including from the oil and gas industry. The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases from certain sources "endanger" public health or welfare. As a result, the EPA has begun to promulgate certain regulations and interpretations that will require new and modified stationary source of greenhouse gases above certain thresholds to report, limit or control such emissions. Although subject to legal challenge, the EPA rules promulgated thus far are currently final and effective and will remain so unless overturned by a court, or unless Congress adopts legislation altering the EPA's regulatory authority. The EPA has also promulgated regulations restricting greenhouse gas emissions, including rules applicable to the power generation sector and oil refining sector, which may affect demand for oil and gas. Pursuant to President Obama's Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions, and as part of the Administration's efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The EPA is expected to propose in spring of 2016 new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas facilities. In addition, some states have taken or proposed legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, a number of states, including states in which the Royalty Properties are located, have indicated an intent to reduce greenhouse gases through state action or regional partnerships. 

Safety. The working interest owners are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, known as "OSHA," and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by oil and gas operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
