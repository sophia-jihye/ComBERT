 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Organization . Marine Petroleum Trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;) is a royalty trust that was created in 1956 under the laws of the State of Texas. The Trust was organized for the sole purpose of providing an efficient, orderly and practical means for the administration and liquidation of rights to payments from certain oil and natural gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico, under license agreements and amendments thereto between the Trust&#146;s predecessors and Gulf Oil Corporation (&#147;Gulf&#148;). As a result of various transactions that have occurred since 1956, the Gulf interests are now held by Chevron Corporation (&#147;Chevron&#148;) and its assignees. 

The indenture pursuant to which the Trust was created (as amended, the &#147;Indenture&#148;) provides that the corporate trustee is to distribute all cash in the Trust, less an amount reserved for the payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses, to unitholders of record on the last business day of February, May, August and November. Payments are to be made on the 28 th day of September, December, March and June of each fiscal year. If the 28 th falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the distribution is payable on the next succeeding business day. 

The Indenture prohibits the operation of any kind of trade or business by the Trust and also provides that the term of the Trust will expire on June 1, 2021, unless extended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of beneficial interest. 

Southwest Bank, an independent state bank chartered under the laws of the State of Texas and headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas (&#147;Southwest Bank&#148;) has served as corporate trustee of the Trust since August 27, 2014. Previously, U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management served as the Trust&#146;s corporate trustee. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references herein to the &#147;Trustee&#148; refer to Southwest Bank, and when used in a historical context for the period prior to August 27, 2014, refer to U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management. 

The Trust&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, Marine Petroleum Corporation (&#147;MPC,&#148; collectively with the Trust, &#147;Marine&#148;), holds title to interests in properties subject to the Trust&#146;s interests that are situated offshore of Louisiana. Ninety-eight percent of all oil, natural gas, and other mineral royalties collected by MPC, less the receiving and collection costs, are retained by and delivered to the Trust. MPC retains the remaining two percent of the overriding royalties along with other items of income and expense until the board of directors declares a dividend out of the corpus. MPC, like the Trust, is prohibited from engaging in a trade or business and only does those things that are necessary for the administration and liquidation of its properties. Marine&#146;s only industry segment or purpose is the administration and collection of royalties. 

Royalties . Marine&#146;s rights are generally referred to as overriding royalty interests by the oil and natural gas industry, and are sometimes referred to as overriding royalty interests in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All production and marketing functions are conducted by the working interest owners of the leases. Revenues from overriding royalties are paid to Marine either (i) on the basis of the selling price of oil, natural gas and other minerals produced, saved and sold, or (ii) at the value at the wellhead as determined by industry standards, when the selling price does not reflect the value at the wellhead. 

Marine holds an overriding royalty interest equal to three-fourths of 1% of the value at the well of any oil, natural gas, or other minerals produced and sold from the leases described in the &#147;Properties&#148; section below. Marine&#146;s overriding royalty interest applies only to existing leases and does not apply to new leases that Chevron or its assignees may acquire. 

Marine also owns a 32.6% interest in Tidelands Royalty Trust &#147;B&#148; (&#147;Tidelands&#148;), a separate Texas trust, which owns interests in four leases covering an aggregate of 17,188 gross acres. The term of the Tidelands royalty trust will expire in 2021, unless extended by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of beneficial interest. Tidelands&#146; indenture provides that the Trustee is to distribute all cash in the trust, less an amount reserved for payment of accrued liabilities and estimated future expenses, to unitholders of record on the last 

&#160;

business day of March, June, September and December of each year. Pursuant to the Indenture, such distributions are to be made within 15 days of the record date. Distributable income is paid from the unconsolidated account balances of Tidelands. Distributable income is comprised of (i) royalties from offshore Texas leases owned directly by Tidelands, plus (ii) 95% of the overriding royalties received by its subsidiary that are retained by and delivered to Tidelands on a quarterly basis, less (iii) administrative expenses of Tidelands. Marine recommends that you read Tidelands&#146; public filings for a description of its risks, business, properties and financial condition and results of operations. 

As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the leases subject to Marine&#146;s interests cover an aggregate of 217,056 gross acres (including Tidelands&#146; interest in 17,188 gross acres). These leases will remain in force until the leases terminate or expire pursuant to their respective terms. Leases may be voluntarily released by the working interest owner after oil and natural gas reserves are produced. Leases may also be abandoned by the working interest owner due to the failure to discover and produce sufficient reserves to make development economically worthwhile. In addition, the U.S. federal government may terminate a lease if the working interest owner fails to develop a lease once it is acquired. 

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, approximately 86% of Marine&#146;s royalty revenues were attributable to the sale of oil and approximately 14% of Marine&#146;s royalty revenues were attributable to the sale of natural gas. The royalty revenues received by Marine are affected by a number of factors, including seasonal fluctuations in demand, the ability of wells to produce due to depletion and changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas. The following table presents the percent of royalties received from various working interest owners, which account for the royalties received in each of the past three years.

Tidelands has reported that royalty revenues from Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations, LLC, Renaissance Offshore LLC and Fieldwood Energy LLC/Apache Corporation accounted for more than 90% of Tidelands&#146; royalty revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Marine derives no revenues from foreign sources and has no export sales. 

Trust Functions . The Trust is administered by officers and employees of its Trustee. The Trust has no employees. See &#147; Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance .&#148; 

All aspects of Marine&#146;s operations are conducted by third parties. These operations include the production and sale of oil and natural gas and the calculation of royalty payments to Marine, which are conducted by oil and natural gas companies that lease tracts subject to Marine&#146;s interests. American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC is the transfer agent for Marine and is responsible for reviewing, processing and paying distributions. 

&#160;

The ability of Marine to receive revenues is entirely dependent upon its rights with respect to the leases held by Chevron and its assignees in the Gulf of Mexico (as more fully described in &#147; Item 2. Properties &#148; below). Moreover, no revenues are payable to Marine until sales of production commence from any such lease. 

The royalty interests held by Marine are depleting with each barrel of oil and cubic foot of natural gas produced. No funds are reinvested by Marine; thus, these depleting assets are not being replaced. 

Widely Held Fixed Investment Trust Reporting Information. The Trustee assumes that some units of beneficial interest are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in U.S. Treasury Regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a customer in street name). Therefore, the Trustee considers the Trust to be a widely held fixed investment trust (&#147;WHFIT&#148;) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Trust will provide tax information in accordance with applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the Trust as a WHFIT. The representative of the Trust that will provide the required information is Southwest Bank as Trustee, and the contact information for the Trustee is as follows: 

Southwest Bank 

2911 Turtle Creek Blvd., Suite 850 

Dallas, Texas 75219 

Telephone number: (855) 588-7939 

Each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor for tax reporting matters.
