Information about the Company&#8217;s four operating segments is below. 

Energy Chemistry Technologies 

(previously referred to as Energy Chemical Technologies) 

The Energy Chemistry Technologies (&#8220;ECT&#8221;) segment designs, develops, manufactures, packages, and markets chemistries for use in oil and gas (&#8220;O&#38;G&#8221;) well drilling, cementing, completion, stimulation, and production activities designed to maximize recovery in both new and mature fields, including enhanced and improved oil recovery markets. These specialty chemistries possess enhanced performance characteristics and are manufactured to withstand a broad range of downhole pressures, temperatures and other well-specific conditions to be compliant with customer specifications. This segment has technical services laboratories and a research and innovation laboratory that focus on design improvements, development and viability testing of new chemistry formulations, and continued enhancement of existing products. Chemistries branded Complex nano-Fluid &#174; &#32;technologies (&#8220;CnF &#174; &#32;products&#8221;) are patented both domestically and internationally and are proven strategically cost-effective performance additives within both oil and natural gas markets. The CnF &#174; &#32;product mixtures are environmentally friendly, stable mixtures of oil, water, and surface active agents which organize molecules into nano structures. The combined advantage of solvents, surface active agents and water, and the resultant nano structures, improve well treatment results as compared to the independent use of solvents and surface active agents. CnF &#174; &#32;products are composed of renewable, plant derived, cleaning ingredients and oils that are certified as biodegradable. CnF &#174; &#32;chemistries help achieve improved operational and financial results for the Company&#8217;s customers in low permeability sand and shale reservoirs. 

The Logistics division of the Company&#8217;s ECT segment designs, operates, and manages automated bulk material handling and loading facilities. The bulk facilities handle dry cement and additives for oil and natural gas well cementing and supply materials used in oilfield operations. 

&#160;

Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies(previously referred to as Consumer and Industrial Chemical Technologies) 

The Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies (&#8220;CICT&#8221;) segment, was added in conjunction with the acquisition of Florida Chemical in May 2013. This segment sources citrus oil domestically and internationally and is one of the largest processors of citrus oils in the world. Products produced from processed citrus oil include (1) high value compounds used as additives by companies in the flavors and fragrances markets and (2) environmentally friendly chemistries for use in the oil &#38; gas industry and numerous other industries around the world. The CICT segment designs, develops, and manufactures products that are sold to companies in the flavor and fragrance industry and specialty chemical industry. These technologies are used within food and beverage, fragrance, and household and industrial cleaning products industries. 

Drilling Technologies 

The Drilling Technologies segment is a leading provider of downhole drilling tools for use in energy and mining activities. This segment manufactures, rents, sells, inspects, and markets specialized equipment used in drilling, completion, production, and work-over activities. Established tool rental operations are strategically located throughout the United States (the &#8220;U.S.&#8221;) and in a number of international markets. Rental tools include stabilizers, drill collars, reamers, wipers, jars, shock subs, wireless survey, measurement while drilling (&#8220;MWD&#8221;) tools, Stemulator &#174; &#32;tools, and mud-motors. Equipment sold primarily includes mining equipment, cementing accessories, and drilling motor components. The Company remains focused on product marketing for this segment in all regions of the U.S., as well as in select international markets through both direct and agent-based sales. 

Production Technologies 

The Production Technologies segment provides pumping system components, electric submersible pumps (&#8220;ESPs&#8221;), gas separators, production valves, and complementary services. Through the Company&#8217;s acquisition of IAL, the Company provides a line of next generation hydraulic pumping units that serve to increase and maximize production for oil and natural gas wells. The Company&#8217;s line of artificial lift products satisfy the requirements of traditional oil and natural gas production and coal bed methane markets by assisting natural gas, oil, and other fluids movement from the producing horizon to the surface. The Company&#8217;s products are sourced internationally and domestically, assembled at domestic locations, and distributed globally. 

Seasonality 

Overall, operations are not significantly affected by seasonality. While certain working capital components build and recede throughout the year in conjunction with established purchasing and selling cycles that can impact operations and financial position, these cycles have not been significant to date. The performance of certain services within each of the Company&#8217;s segments, however, is susceptible to both weather and naturally occurring phenomena, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

the severity and duration of winter temperatures in North America, which impacts natural gas storage levels, drilling activity, and commodity prices; 

&#8226; 

the timing and duration of the Canadian spring thaw and resulting restrictions that impact activity levels; 

&#8226; 

the timing and impact of hurricanes upon coastal and offshore operations; 

&#8226; 

certain Federal land drilling restrictions during identified breeding seasons of protected bird species in key Rocky Mountain coal bed methane producing regions. These restrictions generally have a negative impact on Production Technologies operations in the first or second quarters of the year; and 

&#8226; 

adverse weather in Florida and Brazil can impact the availability of citrus oils for the CICT business unit. 

Product Demand and Marketing 

Demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services is dependent on levels of conventional and non-conventional oil and natural gas well drilling and production, both domestically and internationally. Products are marketed directly to customers through the Company&#8217;s direct sales force and through certain contractual agency arrangements. Established customer relationships provide repeat sales opportunities within all segments. While the Company&#8217;s primary marketing efforts remain focused in North America, a growing amount of resources and effort are focused on emerging international markets, especially in the Middle East and North Africa (&#8220;MENA&#8221;) as well as South America. In addition to direct marketing and relationship development, the Company also markets products and services through the use of third party agents in Mexico, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific. 

Customers 

The Company&#8217;s customers primarily include major integrated oil and natural gas companies, oilfield service companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, pressure pumping service companies, international supply chain management companies, national and state-owned oil companies, household and commercial cleaning product companies, fragrance and cosmetic companies, and food manufacturing companies. The Company had two &#32;major customers for the year ended December 31, 2015 , which accounted for 14% &#32;and 12% &#32;of consolidated revenue, and one &#32;major customer for the years ended December 31, 2014 , and 2013 , which accounted 

&#160;

for 16% &#32;and 16% &#32;of consolidated revenue, respectively. In aggregate, the Company&#8217;s largest three customers collectively accounted for 35% , 29% , and 30% &#32;of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

Research and Innovation 

The Company is engaged in research and innovation activities focused on the design of reservoir specific, customized chemistries in the ECT segment and improvement of existing products and services, and development of new products, processes, and services throughout all segments. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , the Company incurred $7.5 million , $5.0 million , and $3.8 million , respectively, of research and innovation expense. In 2015 , research and innovation expense was approximately 2.2% &#32;of consolidated revenue. The Company expects that its 2016 &#32;research and innovation investment will increase in anticipation of the growth of the business. 

Backlog 

Due to the nature of the Company&#8217;s contractual customer relationships and the way they operate, the Company has historically not had significant backlog order activity. 

Intellectual Property 

The Company&#8217;s policy is to protect its intellectual property, both within and outside of the U.S. The Company considers patent protection for all products and methods deemed to have commercial significance and that may qualify for patent protection. The decision to pursue patent protection is dependent upon several factors, including whether patent protection can be obtained, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with operational and commercial interests. The Company believes its patent and trademark portfolio, combined with confidentiality agreements, trade secrets, proprietary designs, and manufacturing and operational expertise, are necessary and appropriate to protect its intellectual property and ensure continued strategic advantages. The Company currently has 19 issued patents and over six dozen pending patent applications filed in the U.S. and abroad on various chemical compositions and methods, downhole tools, production technologies, and software methods. In addition, the Company currently has 41 registered trademarks and over four dozen pending trademark applications filed in the U.S. and abroad, covering a variety of its goods and services. 

Competition 

The ability to compete in the oilfield services industry and the consumer and industrial markets is dependent upon the Company&#8217;s ability to differentiate its products and services, provide superior quality and service, and maintain a competitive cost structure. Activity levels in the oil field services industry are impacted by current and expected oil and natural gas prices, oil and natural gas drilling activity, production levels, and customer drilling and production designated capital spending. Domestic and international 

regions in which Flotek operates are highly competitive. The unpredictability of the energy industry and commodity price fluctuations create both increased risk and opportunity for the products and services of both the Company and its competitors. 

Certain oil and natural gas service companies competing with the Company are larger and have access to more resources. Such competitors could be better situated to withstand industry downturns, compete on the basis of price, and acquire and develop new equipment and technologies, all of which could affect the Company&#8217;s revenue and profitability. Oil and natural gas service companies also compete for customers and strategic business opportunities. Thus, competition could have a detrimental impact upon the Company&#8217;s business. 

The citrus-based terpene (d-limonene) is a major feedstock for many of the Company&#8217;s CnF &#174; &#32;chemistries. In addition, the Company utilizes naturally derived terpenes from other sources and bio-based solvents from other natural sources when it determines the efficacy of such formulas is appropriate. The Company has the ability to purify these alternative solvents to remove trace amounts of &#8220;BTEX&#8221; (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) and other contaminants to ensure they meet Flotek&#8217;s rigorous environmental standards. 

The Company faces competition from other citrus processors and other solvent sources. Other terpenes can provide an effective substitute to the Company&#8217;s citrus-based terpenes, although, without refinement, are generally of lower quality. Such terpenes can be cheaper than citrus terpenes, but, as noted above, can contain &#8220;BTEX&#8221; compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) and other compounds that have varying degrees of toxicity. The Company&#8217;s chemistries are intended to replace these undesirable qualities. Management believes that environmental constituents will continue to promote &#8220;BTEX&#8221; substitutes, which diminishes the threat of substitution in ecologically sensitive applications from these competitors. 

Raw Materials 

Materials and components used in the Company&#8217;s servicing and manufacturing operations, as well as those purchased for sale, are generally available on the open market from multiple sources. Collection and transportation of raw materials to Company facilities, however, could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Additionally, certain raw materials used by the Chemistries segments are available from limited sources. Disruptions to suppliers could materially impact sales. The prices paid for raw materials vary based on energy, steel, citrus, and other commodity price fluctuations, tariffs, duties on imported materials, foreign currency exchange rates, business cycle position and global demand. Higher prices for chemistries, steel, citrus, and other raw materials could adversely impact future sales and contract fulfillments. 

&#160;

The Company is diligent in its efforts to identify alternate suppliers, in its contingency planning for potential supply shortages, and in its proactive efforts to reduce costs through competitive bidding practices. When able, the Company uses multiple suppliers, both domestically and internationally, to purchase raw materials on the open market. 

Drilling Technologies maintains a three to six month supply of mud-motor inventory parts sourced from international and domestic suppliers, and Drilling Technologies and Production Technologies maintain parts necessary to meet forecast demand. The Company&#8217;s inventory levels are maintained to accommodate the lead time required to secure parts to avoid disruption of service to customers. 

Citrus greening disease has adversely affected the availability of citrus crops around the world, thereby negatively impacting the supply and increasing the price of citrus terpenes. The Company&#8217;s market position, inventory, and forward purchases helps ensure availability for its patented CnF &#174; &#32;technologies, as well as its existing customer base within CICT. As mentioned previously, the Company has also developed new CnF &#174; &#32;formulations utilizing alternative solvents. These new formulations not only diversify the Company&#8217;s dependence on citrus terpenes, but they also provide certain performance benefits necessary for specific customer and reservoir challenges. 

Government Regulations 

The Company is subject to federal, state, and local environmental, occupational safety, and health laws and regulations within the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business. The Company strives to ensure full compliance with all regulatory requirements and is unaware of any material instances of noncompliance. In the U.S., the Company must comply with laws and regulations which include, among others: 

&#8226; 

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; 

&#8226; 

the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; 

&#8226; 

the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; 

&#8226; 

the Toxic Substances Control Act; and 

&#8226; 

the Affordable Care Act. 

In addition to U.S. federal laws and regulations, the Company does business in other countries which have extensive environmental, legal, and regulatory requirements. Laws and regulations strictly govern the manufacture, storage, handling, transportation, use, and sale of chemistry products. The Company evaluates the environmental impact of its actions and attempts to quantify the cost of remediating contaminated property in order to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements and identify and avoid potential liability. Several products of the Energy Chemistry Technologies&#8217; and Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies&#8217; segments are considered hazardous or flammable. In the event of a leak 

or spill in association with Company operations, the Company could be exposed to risk of material cost, net of insurance proceeds, to remediate any contamination. 

From time to time, the Company may be party in environmental litigation and claims, including remediation of properties owned or operated. No environmental litigation or claims are currently being litigated. The Company does not expect that costs related to known remediation requirements will have a significant adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company had 534 employees, exclusive of existing worldwide agency relationships. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and labor relations are generally positive. Certain international locations have staffing or work arrangements that are contingent upon local work councils or other regulatory approvals.
