Our Markets &#38; Products 

The growth of advanced electronic systems using analog RF, microwave, millimeterwave and photonic semiconductor technologies has created demand for high-performance analog semiconductor components, modules and solutions. The terms RF, microwave and millimeterwave are used to refer to electromagnetic waves in a particular frequency range produced by applying an alternating current 

to an antenna or conductor. A wide variety of advanced electronic systems rely on electromagnetic waves for high-speed data transmission or reception. We offer high-performance analog semiconductor products for both wireless and wireline applications across the frequency spectrum from RF to millimeterwave and beyond through photonics. We develop high-value products to serve our customers in three &#32;primary markets including Networks, A&#38;D and Multi-market. 

The market demand for high-performance analog RF, microwave, millimeterwave, and photonic semiconductors is driven by the growth of mobile Internet devices, cloud computing and streaming video that strain existing network capacity, as well as the growth in advanced information-centric military applications. In addition, the increasing need for real-time information, sensing and imaging functions in industrial, medical, scientific and test and measurement applications is driving demand for our products. 

Networks . Growth in the Networks market is driven by the proliferation of wireless and wired devices from smartphones and tablets to data centers, as well as the data rich applications and services they enable such as mobile Internet, cloud computing, video-on-demand, social media, global positioning functionality and location based services. Growth in global next-generation Internet and Internet of Things (IoT) applications drives demand for communications infrastructure equipment requiring amplifiers, filters, receivers, switches, synthesizers, transformers, upconverters and other components to expand and upgrade cellular backhaul, cellular infrastructure, wired broadband and fiber optic networks. Semiconductor products and solutions must continually deliver greater bandwidth and functionality as the demands of our customers and end users increase. 

In December 2014, we completed the acquisition of BinOptics Corporation (BinOptics), a leading merchant provider of InP lasers for data centers, mobile backhaul, silicon photonics and access networks (BinOptics Acquisition). With this acquisition, we have broadened our position in the growing optical component market and expanded our growth opportunities in data center networks, including silicon photonics applications. This transaction expands our optical portfolio with differentiated edge-emitting and surface-emitting Fabry Perot and Distributed Feedback lasers, incorporating proprietary and patented Etched Facet Technology (EFT) for lasers that enables wafer-scale economics in both device manufacturing and testing. 

In December 2015, we completed the acquisition of FiBest Limited (FiBest) a Japan-based merchant market component supplier of optical sub-assemblies (FiBest Acquisition). We acquired FiBest to expand our position in optical networking components. The operations of FiBest are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 

Our expertise in system-level architectures and advanced IC design capability allow us to offer Networks OEM customers highly-integrated solutions optimized for performance and cost. Our portfolio of opto-electronics products includes lasers, clock and data recovery, optical post amplifiers, laser and modulator drivers, transimpedance amplifiers, transmitter and receiver applications in 2.5/6/10/40/100/400 gigabits per second (Gbps) long haul, metro, data center links and fiber-to-the-X (FTTx) fiber optic network components that enable telecommunications carriers and data centers to cost-efficiently increase their network capacity by a factor of four to ten times over earlier generation solutions. We match our opto-electronic components to various lasers enabling our customers to buy more complete solutions for their opto-electronic systems. For optical communications applications, we utilize a proprietary combination of GaAs, InP, and Silicon Germanium (SiGe) technologies to obtain advantages in performance and size. For wired broadband applications, we offer OEM customers the opportunity to streamline their supply chain through our broad catalog of active components such as active splitters, amplifiers, multi-function ICs and switches, as well as passive components such as transformers, diplexers, filters, power dividers, and combiners. 

Aerospace &#38; Defense . In the A&#38;D market, military applications require more advanced electronic systems, such as radar warning receivers, communications data links and tactical radios, UAVs, RF jammers, electronic countermeasures, and smart munitions. Military applications are becoming more sophisticated, favoring higher performance semiconductor ICs based on GaAs and GaN technologies due to their high power density, improved power efficiency, and broadband capability. Radar systems for mapping and targeting missions are undergoing a major transition from existing mechanically-scanned radar products to a next-generation of active electronically-scanned array (AESA) based products. Consisting of hundreds or thousands of transmit/receive modules commonly based on GaAs and GaN technologies, AESAs deliver greater speed, range, resolution and reliability over mechanically-scanned radar products that utilize a single transmitter and receiver with mechanical steering. Military communications employing wireless infrastructure and tactical radios in the field remain critical for allowing geographically dispersed operators to exchange information quickly and efficiently. UAVs and their underlying semiconductor content require innovative designs to meet rigorous specifications for high performance, small size and low power consumption. 

In December 2015, we acquired Aeroflex/Metelics, Inc. (Metelics), a diode supplier, in order to expand our existing diode product lines (Metelics Acquisition). The operations of Metelics are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition through our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 . 

We believe our in-depth knowledge of critical radar system requirements, integration expertise and track record of reliability make us a valued resource for our A&#38;D customers faced with demanding application parameters. Further, we have been accredited by the United States Department of Defense with &#8220;Trusted Foundry&#8221; status, a designation conferred on microelectronics vendors exhibiting the highest levels of process integrity and protection, which we believe differentiates us as a trusted manufacturer of ICs for U.S. military and aerospace applications. For radar applications, we offer standard and custom power transistor pallets, discrete components, switch limiters, phase shifters and integrated modules for transmit and receive functions in air traffic control, marine, weather, and military radar applications. For military communications data link and tactical radio applications, we offer a family of active, passive and discrete 

products, such as Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs), control components, voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), transformers, power transistors and pallets, and diodes. In some cases, we design parts specifically for these applications, while in others, our reputation for quality and our broad catalog allows these demanding customers to reduce the cost of their high-performance systems by designing in standard dual-use or commercial off-the-shelf parts that we have developed for other applications. We believe manufacturing many of these products in our Lowell, Massachusetts Trusted Foundry offers us a competitive advantage in the A&#38;D market because of certain A&#38;D customers&#8217; requirements for a domestic supply chain. 

Multi-market . Multi-market encompasses industrial, medical, test and measurement and scientific applications, where analog RF, microwave and millimeterwave semiconductor solutions are gaining prevalence. In addition, evolving medical technology has increased the need for high-performance MMICs and other semiconductor solutions in medical imaging and patient monitoring to provide enhanced analysis and functionality. 

In the medical industry, our custom designed non-magnetic diode product line is a critical component for certain MRI applications. For sensing and test and measurement applications, we believe our patented Heterolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (HMIC) process is ideal for high-performance, integrated bias networks and switches. Our catalog of general purpose GaAs ICs includes low noise amplifiers, switches and power amplifiers that address a wide range of applications such as industrial automation systems to test and measurement equipment. 

To address our target markets, we offer a broad range of standard and custom ICs, modules and complete subsystems across approximately 40 &#32;product lines. Our product catalog currently consists of more than 4,500 &#32;products including the following key product platforms: power pallets and transistors, ICs, diodes, switches and switch limiters, passive and active components, MCMs, and complete subsystems. Many of our product platforms are leveraged across multiple markets and applications. For example, our application expertise with regard to power transistor technology is leveraged across both scientific laboratory equipment applications and commercial and defense radar system applications. Our diode technology is used in switch filter banks of military tactical radios as well as medical imaging MRI systems.

We believe the combination of our market-facing strategy and our engineering expertise enables us to identify profitable growth opportunities and rapidly develop and deliver new products and solutions complemented by strategic acquisitions. Many of our products have long lifecycles ranging from five to ten years, and some of our products have been shipping for over 20 years. Our goal is to strengthen customer relationships and capture design wins with customers that allow us to be a supplier of components used in their systems. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development efforts are directed toward the rapid development of new and innovative products and solutions, process technologies and packaging techniques. The interaction of semiconductor process technology, circuit design technology and packaging technology defines the performance parameters and the customers&#8217; acceptance of our products. We believe our core competency is the ability to model, design, integrate, package and manufacture differentiated solutions. We leverage this core competency to solve difficult and complex challenges that our customers face during their system design phases. We believe our integrated and customized solutions offer customers high performance, quality, reliability and faster time to market. 

Circuit design and device modeling expertise . Our engineers are experts in the design of circuits capable of reliable, high-performance analog RF, microwave, millimeterwave and photonic signal conditioning. Our staff has decades of experience in solving complex design challenges in applications involving high frequency, high power and environmentally-rugged operating conditions. We also develop proprietary device and electro-magnetic modeling techniques that our engineers use to generate predictive models prior to fabrication. Our predictive modeling expertise allows us to achieve faster design cycle times resulting in shorter time to market for our products. 

Semiconductor process technology . We leverage our domestic semiconductor wafer fabrication capabilities and our foundry suppliers to offer customers the right process technology to meet their particular requirements. Depending on the requirements for the application, our semiconductor products may be designed using an internally developed or externally sourced process technology. 

Packaging expertise . Our extensive packaging expertise enables us to model the interaction between the semiconductor and its package. Our engineers make adjustments in the design of both the semiconductor and the package, to take account of that interaction. We offer products in a variety of different package types for specific applications, including plastic over-molded, ceramic and laminate-based packaging. 

We continue to invest in proprietary processes to enable us to develop and manufacture high-value solutions. For example, we have developed innovative, patented technologies such as HMIC, which provides high integration, high power and low loss switching capabilities for our primary markets. This technology replaces mechanical switches for very high power applications such as wireless base stations. 

Our engineers&#8217; radar, optical and microwave system-level design expertise allows us to offer differentiated solutions that leverage multiple process technologies and are integrated into a single, higher-level assembly, thereby delivering our customers enhanced functionality. 

Research and development expenses were $107.7 million , $82.2 million &#32;and $71.4 million &#32;for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditures in order to drive future new product and process introductions and maintain our competitive position. 

Sales and Marketing 

We employ a global multi-channel sales strategy and support model intended to facilitate our customers&#8217; evaluations and selections of our products. We sell through our direct sales force, our application engineering staff, our global network of independent sales representatives, resellers and distributors, as well as an e-commerce channel. We have strategically positioned our direct sales and applications engineering staff in 35 &#32;locations worldwide, augmented by independent sales representatives and distributors with additional domestic and foreign locations to offer responsive local support resources to our customers and to build long-term relationships. Our application engineers visit customers at their engineering and manufacturing facilities, aid them in understanding our capabilities and collaborate with them to deliver products that can optimize their system performance. Our global independent sales representatives and distributor network allow us to extend our sales capabilities to new customers in new geographies more cost effectively than using our direct sales force alone. 

Our products are principally sold in Asia, the U.S. and Europe, which is where we concentrate our direct sales force, application engineering staff, independent sales representatives and distributors. Sales to our distributors accounted for 13.2% , 20.7% , and 22.0% &#32;of our revenue in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Our agreements with sales representatives, resellers and distributors may provide for an initial term of one or more years with the opportunity for subsequent renewals or for an indefinite term, and also typically provide that either party may terminate the agreement for convenience with a minimum period of prior notice to the other party, usually between 30 and 90 days. 

Our sales efforts are focused on the needs of our customers in our three &#32;primary markets rather than on particular product lines, facilitating product cross-selling across end markets, and within key accounts. Through our website, customers can order online, request samples and access our product selection guides, detailed product brochures and data sheets, application notes, suggested design block diagrams and test fixture information, technical articles and information regarding quality and reliability. 

Customers 

Our customer base is diversified and includes OEM customers, contract manufacturers, resellers and distributors. For fiscal year 2016 , two direct customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue, Huawei Technologies (Huawei) at 15% &#32;and Alltek Technology Corp. (Alltek) at 11.7% . For fiscal year 2015 &#32;only one direct customer individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue, Alltek at 12.1% . In fiscal year 2014 &#32;no direct customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. In addition, our principal distributor, Richardson Electronics, an Arrow Electronics Company (Richardson), accounted for 10.6% , 17.7% &#32;and 18.5% &#32;of our revenue in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Our top 25 direct customers accounted for an aggregate of 65.8% , 54.6% &#32;and 51.2% &#32;of our revenue in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Our orders from and sales to customers in the telecommunications infrastructure and networking markets may tend to be lower in our first fiscal quarter as compared to other quarters due to seasonal inventory management by large OEM and contract manufacturing customers. 

Competition 

The markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by continuously evolving customer requirements. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include: 

&#9642; 

the ability to timely design and deliver products and solutions that meet customers&#8217; performance, reliability and price requirements; 

&#9642; 

the breadth and diversity of product offerings; 

&#9642; 

the ability to provide a reliable supply of products in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner; 

&#9642; 

the ability of engineering talent to drive innovation and new product development; 

&#9642; 

the quality of customer service and technical support; and, 

&#9642; 

the financial reliability, operational stability and reputation of the supplier. 

We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors. We compete primarily with both our customers' internal design resources and other suppliers of high-performance analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline RF, microwave, millimeterwave and photonic applications, some of whom have greater financial resources and scale than us. We expect competition in our markets to intensify, as new competitors enter these markets, existing competitors merge or form alliances and new technologies emerge. We believe that in the future there will be increased competition from companies utilizing alternative technologies, including high-volume manufacturers using low-cost silicon process technology. Some of our competitors are also our customers, and in certain product categories we compete with semiconductor manufacturers from which we also obtain foundry services, such as Sumitomo Electric Device Innovations, Inc. 

We compete with Analog Devices, Inc. (ADI) across our primary markets, Networks, A&#38;D and Multi-market. In the Networks market, we also compete with NXP Semiconductors N.V., Inphi Corporation, Broadcom LTD. (Broadcom), and Semtech Solutions, Inc. In the A&#38;D market, we also compete with Cobham Defense Electronic Systems Corporation (Cobham), Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi), and Qorvo, Inc. (Qorvo). In the Multi-market arena, we also compete with Cobham, Broadcom, Microsemi and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (Skyworks). 

Segment and Geographic Information 

We manage our operations in one reportable segment. Financial information about our operations, including our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region, is included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; appearing elsewhere below. 

&#32;Risks attendant to our foreign operations are discussed in this Annual Report under "Item 1A - Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Backlog and Inventory 

Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis, rather than pursuant to long-term contracts where the customer commits to buy any minimum amount of product over an extended period. On occasion, we ship finished goods inventory to certain customer or third-party &#8220;hub&#8221; locations, but do not recognize revenue associated with such shipments until these customers consume the inventory from the hub. We also frequently ship products from our inventory shortly after receipt of an order, which we refer to as &#8220;turns business&#8221;. A substantial portion of our revenues for any particular fiscal quarter may be derived from turns business transacted in the last few weeks of the quarter, and unanticipated fluctuations in turns business may result in material shifts in revenue between fiscal quarters. Due to the foregoing factors, different ordering patterns of our customers and the wide range of lead times to produce and deliver our products, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants. 

As of September 30, 2016 , we had 399 &#32;U.S. and 141 &#32;foreign issued patents and 76 &#32;U.S. and 54 &#32;foreign pending patent applications covering elements of circuit design, manufacturing and wafer fabrication. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2016 &#32;to 2035 . We do not regard any of the patents scheduled to expire in the next 12 months as material to our overall intellectual property portfolio. Notwithstanding our active pursuit of patent protection when available, we believe that our future success will be determined by the innovation, technical expertise and management abilities of our engineers and management more than by patent ownership. 

The semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which may in the future require that we defend those claims and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product, pay damages or settlement amounts, expend resources to develop non-infringing technology, seek a license, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other intellectual property rights. 

Manufacturing, Sources of Supply and Raw Materials 

When designing a product solution for our customers, we may choose to utilize our internal proprietary process technologies or technologies from external fabrication facilities, or a combination of both. We believe our ability to select both internal and external technologies in our product solutions is a competitive advantage because it helps us to provide a unique and optimized solution for our customers. 

Our internal wafer fabrication and the majority of our internal assembly and test operations are conducted at our Lowell, Massachusetts headquarters and Ithaca, New York facility. We believe having U.S.-based wafer fabrication lines is a competitive advantage for us over competitors that do not have this capability, because it provides us with greater control over quality, a secure source of supply and a domestic source for U.S. A&#38;D customers. We also believe that our U.S.-based wafer fabrication lines allow us to develop products faster with shorter production lead times than if we utilized external foundries, and allow us to efficiently produce a wide range of low, medium and high volume products. We perform internal assembly and test functions at our Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts, Long Beach, California, Ithaca, New York, Nashua, New Hampshire and Hsinchu, Taiwan locations. 

We complement our internal manufacturing with outsourced foundry partners and other suppliers. Our operations staff has extensive expertise in the management of outsourced manufacturing service providers and other supply chain participants. We believe our fab-lite model of outsourcing certain of our manufacturing activities rather than investing heavily in capital-intensive production facilities, provides us with the flexibility to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies our operations, provides access to other process technologies and additional manufacturing capacity and reduces our capital requirements. We also use third-party contract manufacturers for assembly, packaging and test functions, and in some cases for fully-outsourced turnkey manufacturing of our products. 

The principal materials used in the production of our IC products are high purity source materials such as gallium, aluminum, arsenic, nitrite, carbon and silicon. We purchase from hundreds of suppliers worldwide, a wide variety of semiconductors, wafers, packages, metals, printed circuit boards, electromechanical components and other materials for use in our operations. These supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis. The use of external suppliers involves a number of risks, including the possibility of material disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and components, and the lack of control over delivery schedules, capacity, quality and costs. 

While we attempt to maintain alternative sources for our principal raw materials to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases, some of the raw materials and components are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique nature, design or the length of time necessary for re-design or qualification. We routinely utilize single sources of supply for various materials based on availability, performance, efficiency or cost considerations. For example, wafers procured from merchant foundries for a particular process technology are generally sourced through a single foundry on which we rely for all of our wafers in that process. Our reliance on external suppliers puts us at risk of supply chain disruption if a supplier does not have sufficient raw material inventory to meet our manufacturing needs, goes out of business, changes or discontinues the process in which components or wafers are manufactured or declines to continue supplying us for competitive or other reasons, as discussed in more detail in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; herein. Where practical, we attempt to mitigate these risks by qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesigning products for alternative components and purchasing incremental inventory of raw materials and components in order to protect us against supply disruptions. 

Quality Assurance 

The goal of our quality assurance program is for our products to meet our customers&#8217; requirements, be delivered on time, and function reliably throughout their useful lives. The International Organization for Standards (ISO) provides models for quality assurance for various operational disciplines, such as design, manufacturing, and testing, which comprise part of our overall quality management system. Our following locations have each received ISO 9001:2008 certifications in one or more of their principal functional areas: Lowell, Massachusetts; Ithaca, New York; Long Beach, Santa Clara and Newport Beach, California; Morrisville, North Carolina; Nashua, New Hampshire; Belfast, Northern Ireland; Cork, Ireland; Sydney, Australia, Tokyo, Japan and Hsinchu, Taiwan. In addition, our Lowell, Massachusetts and Tokyo, Japan facilities have received an ISO 14001:2004 environmental management systems certification. 

Environmental Regulation 

Our operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under federal, state, and local laws governing health and safety and the environment in the U.S. and other countries. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants into the air, water and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and, requirements regarding the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions. While we are committed to compliance with applicable regulations, the risk of environmental liabilities can never be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur material future expenditures. 

We are also regulated under a number of federal, state and local laws regarding responsible sourcing, recycling, product packaging and product content requirements in the U.S. and other countries, including legislation enacted in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions that have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging. These laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur material expenditures or otherwise cause financial harm. 

Export Regulations 

We market and sell our products both inside and outside the U.S. Certain products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry Security, which require that we obtain an export license before we can export certain controlled products or technology to specified countries. Additionally, some of our products are subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which restrict the export of information and material that may be used for military or intelligence applications by a foreign person. Similar controls exist in other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws could result in sanctions by the government, including substantial monetary penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from government contracts. We maintain an export compliance program staffed by dedicated personnel under which we screen export transactions against current lists of restricted exports, destinations and end users with the objective of managing export-related decisions, transactions and shipping logistics to ensure compliance with these requirements. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 1,400 &#32;individuals worldwide. None of our domestic employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement; however, approximately 17 &#32;of our employees working in certain European locations are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with employees to be good and we have not experienced a work stoppage due to labor issues. 

History and Recent Developments 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in March 2009. Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries, which are organized and operated according to the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation. 

MACOM Technology Solutions Inc., our primary operating subsidiary, which provides high-performance analog semiconductor solutions for use in wireless and wireline applications across the RF, microwave, and millimeterwave spectrum, was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on July 16, 2008. MACOM Technology Solutions Limited, our primary foreign operating subsidiary, was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on November 18, 2008. In September 2008, Cobham acquired certain assets from a third party, including the RF and microwave component and subsystem design and business operations that would ultimately become the operations of MACOM Technology Solutions Inc. and MACOM Technology Solutions Limited. The heritage of some of these business operations date back over 60 years to the founding of Microwave Associates, Inc. and the MACOM brand date back over 30 years. 

In December 2013, we acquired Mindspeed Technologies, Inc. (Mindspeed), a supplier of semiconductor solutions for communications infrastructure applications (the Mindspeed Acquisition). We acquired Mindspeed to further our expansion into high-performance analog products. 

In February 2014, subsequent to closing the Mindspeed Acquisition, we divested the wireless business of Mindspeed, which did not meet our expectations for profitable growth. The operations of the wireless business are included in discontinued operations. 

In May 2014, we divested Mindspeed's communications processor equipment (CPE) product line, which did not meet our expectations for profitable growth. The operations of the CPE product line are included in the results of continuing operations through the date of the sale. 

In February 2014, we completed the acquisition of Nitronex, LLC (Nitronex) (the Nitronex Acquisition). Nitronex designs, develops, manufactures and markets GaN semiconductors. We funded the Nitronex Acquisition through the use of available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We acquired Nitronex from a party under common control. As a result, we have accounted for the Nitronex Acquisition as a pooling of interest from the date of acquisition by the common control party in June 2012. The original acquisition of Nitronex by the common control party was accounted for as a purchase. Our financial statements have been retroactively combined to include the results of operations of Nitronex from June 2012. 

In December 2014, we completed the acquisition of BinOptics, a leading merchant provider of InP lasers for data centers, mobile backhaul, silicon photonics and access networks to broaden our position in the optical components market. 

In August 2015, we divested the Automotive business to Autoliv ASP Inc. (Autoliv). The business did not meet our expectations for profitable growth. 

In December 2015, we completed the acquisition of FiBest Limited a Japan-based merchant market component supplier of optical sub-assemblies. We acquired FiBest to expand our position in optical networking components. 

In December 2015, we acquired Metelics, a diode supplier, in order to expand our existing diode product lines. 

We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of technologies, design teams, products and companies that complement our strengths and help us execute our strategies. Our acquisition strategy is designed to accelerate our revenue growth, expand our technology portfolio, grow our addressable market and create shareholder value. We believe our management team has a proven track record in identifying, acquiring and successfully integrating companies and technologies in the high-performance analog semiconductor industry.
