Business 

Company Overview 

Kennedy Wilson is a global real estate investment company. We own, operate, and invest in real estate both on our own and through our investment management platform. We focus on multifamily and commercial properties located in the Western U.S., UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan. To complement our investment business, the Company also provides real estate services primarily to financial services clients. 

Our value is primarily derived from our ownership in income producing real estate assets. We have an ownership interest in approximately 39 million &#32;square feet of property globally, including 24,371 &#32;multifamily rental units. In addition to our core income producing real estate, we engage in redevelopment and value add initiatives through which we enhance cash flows or reposition asset to increase disposal value. Additionally, our investment management and property services business manages over $18 billion of AUM the majority of which we have an ownership interest in and the balance we manage for third parties. 

We have over 495 &#32;employees in 25 &#32;offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Jersey, Spain, Italy and Japan and manage and work with over 5,000 operating associates. 

The following is our business model: 

&#8226; 

Identify countries and markets with an attractive investment landscape 

&#8226; 

Establish operating platforms in our target markets 

&#8226; 

Develop local intelligence and create long-lasting relationships; primarily with financial institutions 

&#8226; 

Leverage relationships and local knowledge to drive proprietary investment opportunities with a focus on off-market transactions that we expect will result in above average cash flows and returns over the long term 

&#8226; 

Acquire high quality assets, either on our own or with strategic partners, utilizing cash from our balance sheet (funded by cash flows from operations, refinancing of current investments, investments sales or the sale of equity or debt securities) and typically financing them on a long-term basis 

&#8226; 

Reposition assets and enhance cash flows post-acquisition 

&#8226; 

Explore development opportunities on underutilized portions of assets; primarily excess land with little or no basis adjacent to income producing properties 

&#8226; 

Continuously evaluate and selectively harvest asset and entity value through strategic realizations utilizing both the public and private markets 

&#8226; 

Utilize our services businesses to meet client needs, strengthen relationships with financial institutions, and position us as a valuable resource and partner to these institutions for any future real estate opportunities 

Since going public on November 13, 2009 through December 31, 2015 , the annualized total rate of return (including dividends) of our common stock (NYSE: KW) was 17.1%, compared to the return of the S&#38;P 500 index of 13.1%. Past stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance.

Business Segments 

Our operations are defined by two core business units: KW Investments and KW Services. KW Investments invests our capital in real estate-related assets. KW Services is a niche business that provides a full array of real estate-related services to the Company and its investment partners, third party owners, and lenders, with a strong focus on financial institution based clients. Included in KW services is our management of KWE. The two segments have a symbiotic relationship and work closely together. KW Services provides insight and creates investment opportunities for KW Investments while KW Investments provides clients the ability to utilize the capabilities of KW Services. 

KW Investments 

We invest our capital in real estate assets and loans secured by real estate either on our own or through our investment management platform. When we have partners, we are typically the general partner in the arrangement with a promoted interest in the profits of our investments beyond our ownership percentage. The Company has an average ownership interest across all investments of approximately 38% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . Our equity partners include public shareholders, financial institutions, foundations, endowments, high net worth individuals and other institutional investors. 

The following are product types we invest in through the KW Investments segment: 

Multifamily 

We pursue multifamily acquisition opportunities where we believe we can unlock value through a myriad of strategies, including institutional management, asset rehabilitation, repositioning and creative recapitalization. We focus primarily on apartments in supply-constrained, infill markets. Through our Vintage Housing Holdings ("VHH") partnership, we also utilize low-income housing tax credit structures for income and age restricted properties. As of December 31, 2015 , we hold investments in 24,371 &#32;multifamily apartment units across 129 &#32;properties primarily located in the Western United States, Ireland, United Kingdom and Japan. 

&#32;2 

Commercial 

We source, acquire, and finance various types of commercial real estate which includes office, industrial, retail, and mixed-use assets. After acquisition, the properties are generally repositioned to enhance market value. Assets are either sold as part of property-specific investment strategies designed to deliver above-market returns to our clients and shareholders or held if producing above average cash flows. As of December 31, 2015 , we own interests in 319 &#32;commercial properties, totaling over 18.9 million &#32;square feet, located throughout the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan. 

Loan Originations/Discounted Loan Purchases 

We acquire and/or originate loans secured by real estate. Our acquisitions and originations include individual notes on all real estate property types as well as portfolios of loans purchased from financial institutions, corporations and government agencies. We deliver value through loan resolutions, discounted payoffs, and sales. We also convert certain loans into a direct ownership in the underlying real estate collateral. Our discounted loan pool portfolio as of December 31, 2015 &#32;had current unpaid principal balance ("UPB") of $558.6 million . 

Our loan investment portfolio is principally related to loans acquired at a discount from their contractual balance due as a result of deteriorated credit quality of the borrower. Such loans are underwritten by us based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral. Due to the discounted purchase price, we seek and are generally able to accomplish near term realization of the loan in a cash settlement or by obtaining title to the property. Accordingly, the credit quality of the borrower is not of substantial importance to our evaluation of the risk of recovery from the investment. 

Hotel 

We acquire hotels in certain opportunistic situations in which we are able to purchase at a significant discount to replacement or can implement our value-add investment approach. 

Residential and Other 

In certain cases, we may pursue for sale housing acquisition opportunities, including land for entitlements, finished lots, urban infill housing sites and partially finished and finished housing projects. On certain income-producing acquisitions, there are adjacent land parcels to which we assign little or no basis and for which we may pursue entitlement activities or, in some cases, development or re-development opportunities. This group also includes our investment in marketable securities. Included in Western U.S. residential are three residential investments and one loan investment in Hawaii. Our investment account balance for these Hawaiian investments is $148.3 million . 

While our core investments have been in the specific markets and locations listed above, we will evaluate opportunities to earn above market returns across many other segments and geographic locations. 

Investment account 

The investment account represents the Company's carrying value of equity invested before depreciation and amortization. In 2015 , together with our equity partners, we acquired $3.2 billion of real estate and loans secured by real estate at purchase price. These acquisitions were comprised of the following: 61% commercial, 31% multifamily, 7% loans secured by real estate and 1% other. 

At December 31, 2015 , we and our equity partners held a real estate and real estate related investment portfolio with assets at a book value of approximately $10.7 billion , with approximately 58% &#32;leverage to depreciated book value. The Company has an average ownership interest across all of its investments of approximately 38% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

The Company's investment account increased during the year primarily due to the investment of corporate cash into consolidated real estate. The investment account also increased due to the consolidation of joint venture investments and conversion of loan purchases into consolidated real estate which resulted in fair value gains due to real estate being worth more than Company's original basis. Noncontrolling interest decreased during the year due to $293.0 million in net distributions relating to the Company's acquisition of KWE shares and distributions relating to property sales and investing distributions from debt refinancings. Foreign currency translation and hedge losses also decreased noncontrolling interests by $102.7 million. 

The following table depicts how our equity in the portfolio is derived from the financial statement captions in our audited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014:

KW Services has five main lines of business: investment management, property services, research, brokerage, and auction and conventional sales. These five business lines generate revenue for us through fees and commissions. 

We manage approximately 50 million &#32;square feet of properties for the Company and its investment partners (including KWE) in the United States, Europe, and Asia, which includes assets we have ownership interests in and third party owned assets. With 25 &#32;offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Jersey, Spain, Italy and Japan, we have the capabilities and resources to provide property services to real estate owners as well as the experience, as a real estate investor, to understand client concerns. The managers of KW Services have an extensive track record in their respective lines of business and in the real estate community as a whole. Their knowledge and relationships are an excellent driver of businesses through the services business as well as on the investment front. 

Additionally, KW Services plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies. 

Investment Management 

Our investment management division, provides acquisition, asset management and disposition services to our equity partners as well as to third parties . &#32;Currently, we have seven closed end funds for which we serve as general partner and manager and separate accounts with strategic partners. In addition, we serve as the manager of KWE and are entitled to receive management fees (50% of which are paid in KWE shares) equal to 1% of KWE&#8217;s adjusted net asset value (reported by KWE to be $2.4 billion at December 31, 2015) and certain performance fees. Under US GAAP, we are required to consolidate the results of KWE and as such fees earned from KWE are eliminated in consolidation. 

Property Services 

Our property services division manages commercial real estate for third-party clients, fund investors, and investments held by Kennedy Wilson. In addition to earning property management fees, consulting fees, leasing commissions, construction management fees, disposition fees, and accounting fees, the property services division gives Kennedy Wilson insight into local markets and potential acquisitions. Leveraging over 38 years of real estate experience, we approach property management from the perspective of an owner and are active in identifying and implementing value creation strategies. The division has a proven track record of success in managing stabilized as well as value-add investments.

Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate Plc (LSE: KWE) 

KWE closed its initial public offering in February 2014 and a follow-on offering in October 2014, raising an aggregate of approximately $2.2 billion in gross proceeds. KWE, whose ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange&#8217;s main market and who is a member of the FTSE 250 Index, acquires real estate and real estate-related assets in Europe. Since its launch in February 2014 through December 31, 2015 , KWE has acquired 337 real estate assets with approximately 13.1 million square feet and disposed of 35 assets with approximately 1.3 million square feet. As of December 31, 2015 , KWE had a portfolio value of $4.1 billion with its assets located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Italy, which KWE currently expects to produce over $235 million of annualized net operating income (net rental income for property portfolios, EBITDA for hotels and interest income for loan portfolios). As of December 31, 2015 , Kennedy Wilson held approximately 24.7 million ordinary shares of KWE (with a cost basis of $440.0 million ) or approximately 18.2% of the total issued share capital of KWE. 

KWE increased its leverage to 40% at December 31, 2015 from 8% at December 31, 2014 mainly due to the issuance of unsecured corporate debt during the year. The current leverage ratio is more in line with what KWE expects to maintain going forward. 

KWE is externally managed by one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries whom we refer to as KWE Manager pursuant to an investment management agreement whereby we will be entitled to receive certain management and performance fees. KWE Manager is entitled to an annual management fee (payable quarterly in arrears) equal to 1% of KWE&#8217;s adjusted net asset value (reported by KWE to be $2.4 billion at December 31, 2015 ) and certain performance fees. The management fee payable to KWE Manager is paid half in cash and half in shares of KWE. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , KWH earned $23.3 million in management fees. 

We are also entitled to receive an annual performance fee equal to 20% of the lesser of (i) the excess of the shareholder return for the relevant year (defined as the change in KWE&#8217;s adjusted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends paid) over a 10% annual return hurdle, and (ii) the excess of year-end adjusted net asset value per ordinary share over a &#8220;high water mark.&#8221; The performance fee is payable in shares of KWE that vest equally over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2015 , $43.7 million &#32;in such fees have been earned and accrued (not yet paid) by Kennedy Wilson. The final calculation of the performance fee was completed at the conclusion of KWE&#8217;s financial year and such fee will be paid to Kennedy Wilson during the first quarter of 2016. 

The compensation committee of the Company&#8217;s board of directors approved and reserved up to thirty percent (30%) of any performance fees earned by the Company with respect to its management of KWE to be allocated to certain employees of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, awards representing approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of the performance fees had been allocated to certain employees. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, the remaining five percent (5%) of the performance fees of the performance fees earned in 2015 were allocated to employees. 

Due to the terms of the investment management agreement and Kennedy Wilson's equity ownership interest in KWE, pursuant to the guidance set forth in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic 810 - Consolidation (&#8220;Subtopic 810&#8221;), the results and financial position of KWE are consolidated in our financial statements. As such, fees earned by KWE Manager are eliminated in the attached consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to the investment management agreement, subject to certain exceptions, KWE will be provided priority access to all real estate or real estate loan opportunities sourced by us in Europe that are within the parameters of KWE&#8217;s investment policy. Compensation and certain general and administrative expenses relating to KWE is borne by Kennedy Wilson as employees of the Company work on behalf of KWE Manager.

Legacy European Investments 

Prior to KWE's formation and for investments that do not meet KWE's investment guidelines, the Company directly invested in 18 &#32;properties, five &#32;loan pools and a servicing platform in Europe that have total assets of $862.3 million &#32;included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and $274.2 million &#32;of equity as of December 31, 2015 . Four &#32;of the five &#32;loan pools were fully resolved as of December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's weighted average ownership in these investments was 62% . 

Value Creation 

Kennedy Wilson&#8217;s differentiated and unique approach to investing is the cornerstone of how we create value for our shareholders. Our investment philosophy is based on three core fundamentals: 

&#8226; 

Leverage our global footprint and complementary investments and services businesses to identify attractive investment markets across the world. 

&#8226; 

Selectively invest in opportunities across many real estate product types with a goal of maximizing cash flow and return on capital. 

&#8226; 

Actively manage assets and finance them conservatively to generate stable, predictable and growing cash flows for shareholders and clients. 

&#32;8 

Kennedy Wilson is able to create value for its shareholders in the following ways: 

&#8226; 

We are able to identify and acquire attractive real estate assets across many markets, in part due to the significant proprietary deal flow driven from an established global network of industry relationships, particularly with financial institutions. This can create value by allowing us to maintain and develop a large pipeline of attractive opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Our operating expertise allows us to focus on opportunistic investments where we can increase the value of assets and cash flows, such as distressed real estate owners or lenders seeking liquidity, under-managed or under-leased assets, and repositioning opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Many times, these investments are acquired at a discount to replacement cost or recent comparative sales, thereby offering opportunities to achieve above average total returns. In many cases this may lead to significant additional returns, such as a promoted interest, based on the performance of the assets. 

&#8226; 

In many instances, our long-lasting and deep relationships with financial institutions allow us to refinance loans to reduce interest rates and/or increase borrowings due to property appreciation and thereby obtain cash flow to use for new investments. We generally implement this strategy after our value add initiatives have been executed, thus allowing us to maintain moderate levels of leverage. 

&#8226; 

KW Services plays a critical role in supporting our investment strategy by providing local market intelligence and real-time data for evaluating investments, generating proprietary transaction flow and creating value through efficient implementation of asset management or repositioning strategies. 

&#8226; 

We understand that real estate is cyclical. Our management team employs a multi-cyclical approach that has resulted in our AUM being globally diversified across many sectors of real estate while maintaining a healthy liquidity position and adequate access to capital. 

Competitive Strengths &#32; 

We have a unique platform from which to execute our investment and services strategy. The combination of an investment platform and a service business provides several competitive strengths when compared to other real estate buyers operating stand-alone or investment-focused firms and may allow us to generate superior risk-adjusted returns. Our investment strategy focuses on investments that offer significant appreciation potential through intensive property management, leasing, repositioning, redevelopment and the opportunistic use of capital. We differentiate ourselves from other firms in the industry with our full service, investment oriented structure. Whereas most other firms use an investment platform to obtain additional service business revenue, we use our service platform to enhance the investment process and ensure the alignment of interests with our investors. 

The real estate business is cyclical. Real estate cycles are generally impacted by many factors including availability of equity and debt capital, borrowing cost, rent levels, and asset values. Our strategy has resulted in a strong track record of creating both asset and entity value for the benefit of our shareholders and partners over these various real estate cycles. 

Our competitive strengths include: 

&#8226; 

Transaction experience: Our Executive Committee has more than 125 years of combined real estate experience and has been working and investing together on average for over 15 years. Members of the Executive Committee have collectively acquired, developed and managed in excess of $20 billion of real estate investments in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan throughout various economic cycles, both at our Company and throughout their careers. 

&#8226; 

Extensive relationship and sourcing network: We leverage our services business in order to source off-market deals. In addition, the Executive Committee and our acquisition team have transacted deals in nearly every major metropolitan market on the West Coast of the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Italy and Japan. Their local presence and reputation in these markets have enabled them to cultivate key relationships with major holders of property inventory, in particularly financial institutions, throughout the real estate community. 

&#8226; 

Structuring expertise and speed of execution: Prior acquisitions completed by us have taken a variety of forms including direct property investments, joint ventures, exchanges involving stock or operating partnership units, participating loans and investments in performing and non-performing mortgages at various capital stack positions with the objective of long-term ownership. We believe we have developed a reputation of being able to quickly execute, as well as originate and creatively structure acquisitions, dispositions and financing transactions. 

&#8226; 

Vertically integrated platform for operational enhancement: We have over 495 &#32;employees in both KW Investments and KW Services, with 25 &#32;regional offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Jersey and Japan and manage and oversee over 5,000 &#32;operating associates. We have a hands-on approach to real estate investing and possess the local expertise in property management, leasing, construction management, development and investment sales, which we believe enable us to invest successfully in selected submarkets. 

&#32;9 

&#8226; 

Risk protection and investment discipline: We underwrite our investments based upon a thorough examination of property economics and a critical understanding of market dynamics and risk management strategies. We conduct an in-depth sensitivity analysis on each of our acquisitions. This analysis applies various economic scenarios that include changes to rental rates, absorption periods, operating expenses, interest rates, exit values and holding periods. We use this analysis to develop our disciplined acquisition strategies. 

Industry Overview 

United States 

Supported by historically low interest rates and a strengthening U.S. economy, U.S. real estate prices continued their upward trend during 2015. The improving U.S. economic landscape has improved occupancy in commercial properties in the majority of U.S. real estate markets. In coastal Western U.S. markets, higher residential home prices and low housing supply has created strong demand for apartments and led to continued increases in rents. The year ended with the Federal Reserve raising short term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, marking the end of an extraordinary seven year period during which the federal funds rate was held at nearly zero. 

Falling oil prices and the concern of slowing global growth has resulted in a volatile beginning to 2016, which has also created uncertainty around the timing and nature of future interest rate hikes. However, we believe fundamentals for U.S. real estate remain attractive due to steady moderate growth of the U.S. economy, still historically low interest rates, and continued global appetite for U.S. real estate. 

United Kingdom 

Despite significant capital market volatility and worries about a global economic slowdown, the UK continues to show positive signs in terms of consumer confidence, employment levels and earnings growth. Preliminary estimates show that the economy grew by 2.2% overall for 2015, supported by the service sector and, importantly, is estimated to be performing ahead of the pre-crisis peak. Following the United Kingdom general election the European Union Referendum Act 2015 was passed by the British Parliament to hold a referendum in the United Kingdom and Gibraltar on whether the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union. 

London continues to lead the recovery, with growth for 2015 at 3.4%, according to Ernst &#38; Young. Central London office take-up for 2015 was 14.5 million sq. ft., which compares favorably to the ten-year average take-up of 12.7 million sq. ft., according to CBRE, and rental growth of 14% has outperformed all other sub-markets. 

Ireland 

According to the Central Bank of Ireland, the Irish economy is continuing to gather momentum and is forecast to grow by 4.8% in 2016. Economic indicators are strong, with retail sales up sharply, unemployment dipping below 9% and consumer sentiment at a 15-year high, according to the Central Statistics Office of Ireland. In the Dublin property market, this economic growth is translating into improved occupational demand across our key sectors. Dublin prime office take-up is well ahead of previous years and the ten-year average which is pushing rents up further with 2015 producing year-on-year office CBD rental growth of 22% . While this will provide some relief for tenants in a market where supply shortages continue to drive rents upwards, there is no cap on rents, which will continue to be reviewed to market levels and it will not have a significant impact on expected longer-term returns from the sector. 

Spain 

&#32; The investment market has been dominated by office transactions but after several years of slow activity, the retail market is back on investors&#8217; radars, as good economic forecasts and increased liquidity are starting to drive this market. In excess of &#8364;3 billion of retail investments were transacted in 2015, which is higher than the 2006 peak, according to Savills. 

Preliminary Q4 GDP estimates in Spain are indicating that the economy delivered ten straight quarters of growth, according to the National Statistics Institute. This brings 2015 GDP growth to 3.2%, more than double the 1.4% growth of 2014 and the fastest level since 2007. The fall in energy prices will support this further by boosting disposable income. Looking forward, while the Spanish economy is still on the road to recovery, the economy has shown an upward trend with improving underlying fundamentals. 

Italy 

The economic recovery has been slow in Italy. Positives in 2015 include a moderate pick up in industrial production, household disposable income and consumer confidence. However, these are offset by unemployment that remains in the low double-digits and appears uneven in its evolution. We expect continued quantitative easing to buoy the region. The investment market remains competitive, reaching &#8364;8.1 billion in 2015, up 55% on the previous year and in line with ten-year average volumes. Milan remains the most attractive office market, with improved leasing fundamentals, take-up set to reach its ten-year average, 

&#32;10 

tenant incentives in decline and the investment market remaining the most liquid. We continue to expect to see the most significant investment opportunities arising from fixed-life funds in liquidation or where sponsors have been unable to execute on business plans, generating a good pipeline of off-market opportunities. 

Japan 

The economic stimulus program in Japan instituted by Prime Minister Abe has led to a weakening of the Japanese yen against most major currencies and continues to create a tailwind for asset prices. The prospect of hosting the 2020 Summer Olympics has strengthened corporate demand in Tokyo. In addition, capital continues to flow into the country from a variety of investment sources, both domestic and international. We believe that there will be a continued interest in the Japanese real estate market due to its attractive exchange rate and low interest rates. 

Competition 

We compete with a range of global, national and local real estate firms, individual investors and other corporations, both private and public. Because of our unique mix of investments and services businesses, we compete with companies that invest in real estate and loans secured by real estate along with brokerage and property management companies. Our investment business competes with real estate investment partnerships, real estate investments trusts, private equity firms and other investment companies and regional investors and developers. We believe that our relationships with the sellers and our ability to close an investment transaction in a short time period at competitive pricing provide us a competitive advantage. The real estate services business is both highly fragmented and competitive. We compete with real estate brokerage and auction companies on the basis of our relationship with property owners, quality of service, and commissions charged. We compete with property management and leasing firms also on the basis of our relationship with clients, the range and quality of services provided, and fees and commissions charged. 

Foreign Currency 

Approximately 47% &#32;of our investment account is invested through our foreign platforms in their local currencies. Investment level debt is generally incurred in local currencies and we consider our equity investment as the appropriate exposure to evaluate for hedging purposes. Fluctuations in foreign exchanges rates may have a significant impact on the results of our operations. In order to manage the effect of these fluctuations, we generally hedge our book equity exposure to foreign currencies through currency forward contracts and options. We typically hedge 50%-100% of book equity exposure against these foreign currencies. 

Transaction-based Results 

A significant portion of our cash flow is tied to transaction activity which can affect an investor&#8217;s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis or to easily evaluate the breadth of our operation. Historically, this variability has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows to be tied to transaction activity, which is not necessarily concentrated in any one quarter. In addition, our operating results can be affected by acquisition-related gains, which often can cause concentrated gain recognition in particular periods. While acquisition related gains can have a material result on our net income, because it arises from remeasurement of asset value, it does not affect operating income or cash flow. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we have 495 &#32;employees in 25 &#32;offices throughout the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Jersey, Italy and Japan and manage and oversee over 5,000 &#32;operating associates. We believe that we have been able to attract and maintain high quality employees. There are no employees subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Non-GAAP Measures and Certain Definitions 

&#8220;KWH,&#8221; &#8220;Kennedy Wilson,&#8221; the "Company," "we," "our," or "us" refer to Kennedy-Wilson Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

&#8220;KWE&#8221; refers to Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate plc, a London Stock Exchange listed company that we externally manage through a wholly-owned subsidiary. The results of KWE are consolidated in our financial statements due to our control of KWE as of December 31, 2015 . We own an approximately 18.2% &#32;equity interest in KWE and throughout this report, we refer to our pro-rata ownership stake in investments made and held directly by KWE. 

"KW Group" refers to Kennedy Wilson and its consolidated subsidiaries that we consolidate in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP, including KWE. 

" Acquisition-related gains" &#32; consist of non-cash gains recognized by the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries upon a GAAP required fair value measurement due to a business combination. These gains are typically recognized when a loan is converted into consolidated real estate owned and the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds the basis in the previously held loan. These gains also arise when there is a change of control of an investment. The gain amount is based upon the fair value of the Company&#8217;s or its consolidated subsidiaries' equity in the investment in excess of the carrying amount of the equity directly preceding the change of control. 

"Adjusted EBITDA" represents Consolidated EBITDA, as defined below, adjusted to exclude corporate merger and acquisition-related expenses, share-based compensation expense for the Company and EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze our business because it adjusts Consolidated EBITDA for items we believe do not accurately reflect the nature of our business going forward or that relate to non-cash compensation expense or noncontrolling interests. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Additionally, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations. However, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized measurements under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance, readers should use Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management&#8217;s discretionary use, as it does not remove all non-cash items (such as acquisition-related gains) or consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. The amounts shown for Consolidated EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. 

" Adjusted fees" &#32; refers to Kennedy Wilson&#8217;s investment management, property services and research fees adjusted to include fees eliminated in consolidation and Kennedy Wilson&#8217;s share of fees in unconsolidated service businesses. 

" Adjusted Net Asset Value" &#32; is calculated by KWE as net asset value adjusted to include properties and other investment interests at fair value and to exclude certain items not expected to crystallize in a long-term investment property business model such as the fair value of financial derivatives and deferred taxes on property valuation surpluses. 

" Adjusted Net Income" &#32; represents Consolidated Adjusted Net Income as defined below, adjusted to exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, before depreciation and amortization. 

"Assets under Management" &#32;("AUM") &#32;generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in) oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, and investments in joint ventures. Our AUM is principally intended to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our AUM consists of the total estimated fair value of the real estate properties and other real estate related assets either owned by third parties, wholly owned by us or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in our AUM. The estimated value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost. 

&#160;"Cap rate&#8221; represents the net operating income of an investment of the year preceding its acquisition or disposition divided by the purchase or sale price. Cap rates set forth in this presentation only includes data from income-producing properties. Cap rates represent historical performance and are not a guarantee of future NOI. Properties for which a cap rate is provided may not continue to perform at that cap rate. 

" Consolidated Adjusted Net Income" represents net income before depreciation and amortization, our share of depreciation and amortization included in income from unconsolidated investments and share-based compensation expense. 

"Consolidated EBITDA" represents net income before interest expense, our share of interest expense included in income 

&#32;12 

from investments in unconsolidated investments, depreciation and amortization, our share of depreciation and amortization included in income from unconsolidated investments, loss on early extinguishment of corporate debt and income taxes. We do not adjust Consolidated EBITDA for gains or losses on the extinguishment of mortgage debt as we are in the business of purchasing discounted notes secured by real estate and, in connection with these note purchases, we may resolve these loans through discounted payoffs with the borrowers. Consolidated EBITDA is not a recognized term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and does not purport to be an alternative to net earnings as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, Consolidated EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management's discretionary use, as it does not remove all non-cash items (such as acquisition-related gains) or consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Our presentation of Consolidated EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our management believes Consolidated EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. Additionally, we believe Consolidated EBITDA is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations. 

" Consolidated investment account" &#32; refers to the sum of Kennedy Wilson&#8217;s equity in: cash held by consolidated investments, consolidated real estate and acquired in-place leases, net hedge assets, unconsolidated investments, consolidated loans gross of accumulated depreciation and amortization, and net other assets. 

&#160;&#8220;Equity multiple&#8221; is calculated by dividing the amount of total distributions received by KW from an investment (including any gains, return of equity invested by KW and promoted interests) by the amount of total contributions invested by KW in such investment. This metric does not take into account management fees, organizational fees, or other similar expenses, all of which in the aggregate may be substantial and lower the overall return to KW. Equity multiples represent historical performance and are not a guarantee of the performance of future investments. 

&#160;&#8220;Equity partners&#8221; refers to non-wholly-owned subsidiaries that we consolidate in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP, including KWE, and third-party equity providers. 

&#160;"Investment account&#8221; refers to the consolidated investment account presented after noncontrolling interest on invested assets gross of accumulated depreciation and amortization. 

&#160;"Net operating income" or " NOI&#8221; is a non-GAAP measure representing the income produced by a property calculated by deducting operating expenses from operating revenues. 

"Operating associates" generally refer to individuals that are employed by or affiliated with third-party consultants, contractors, property managers or other service providers that we manage and oversee on a day-to-day basis with respect to our investments and services businesses. &#160; 

&#160; &#160;&#8220;Same property" refers to properties in which Kennedy Wilson has an ownership interest during the entire span of both periods being compared.
