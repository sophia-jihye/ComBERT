Business development 

&#160; 

Liberty Star Uranium &#38; Metals Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;Liberty Star&#8221;) was formerly Liberty Star Gold Corp. and formerly Titanium Intelligence, Inc. (&#8220;Titanium&#8221;). Titanium was incorporated on August 20, 2001 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On February 5, 2004, we commenced operations in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business. Big Chunk Corp. (&#8220;Big Chunk&#8221;), our wholly owned subsidiary, is engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties business in the State of Alaska. In April 2007, we changed our name to Liberty Star Uranium &#38; Metals Corp. Hay Mountain Super Project LLC (&#8220;HMSP&#8221;), our wholly owned subsidiary, serves as the primary holding company for development of the potential ore bodies encompassed in the Hay Mountain area of interest in Arizona. We are in the exploration phase of operations and have not generated any revenues from operations. 

&#160; 

Our current business 

&#160; 

We are engaged in the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties in the States of Arizona and Alaska. Claims in the State of Alaska are held in the name of Big Chunk. Claims in the State of Arizona are held in the name of Liberty Star. We use the term &#8220;Super Project&#8221; to indicate a project in which numerous mineral targets have been identified, any one or more of which could potentially contain commercially viable quantities of minerals. Our significant projects are described below. 

&#160; 

North Pipes Super Project (&#8220;North Pipes&#8221; and &#8220;NPSP&#8221;): The NPSP is located in Northern Arizona on the Arizona Strip. We plan to ascertain whether the NPSP claims possess commercially viable deposits of uranium and associated co-product metals. We have not identified any ore reserves to date. 

&#160; 

Big Chunk Super Project: The Big Chunk Super Project is located in the Iliamna region of Southwestern Alaska. We plan to ascertain whether the Big Chunk Super Project claims possess commercially viable deposits of copper, gold, molybdenum, silver, palladium rhenium and zinc. We have not identified any ore reserves to date. 

&#160; 

Tombstone Super Project (&#8220;Tombstone&#8221;) (formerly referred to as Tombstone Porphyry Precious Metals Project): Tombstone is located in Cochise County, Arizona and covers the Tombstone caldera and its environs. Within the Tombstone caldera is the Hay Mountain target where we are concentrating our work at this time. We plan to ascertain whether the Tombstone, Hay Mountain claims possess commercially viable deposits of copper, molybdenum, gold, silver, lead, zinc, manganese and other metals including Rare Earth Elements (REE&#8217;s). We have not identified any ore reserves to date. 

&#160; 

East Silver Bell Porphyry Copper Project (&#8220;East Silver Bell&#8221;): East Silver Bell is located northwest of Tucson, Arizona. We plan to ascertain whether the East Silver Bell claims possess commercially viable deposits of copper. We have not identified any ore reserves to date. 

&#160; 

Title to mineral claims involves certain inherent risks due to difficulties in determining the validity of certain claims, as well as potential for problems arising from the frequently ambiguous conveyancing history characteristic of many mineral properties. We have investigated title to all the Company&#8217;s mineral properties and, to the best of its knowledge, title to all properties are in good standing. 

&#160; 

The mineral resource business generally consists of three stages: exploration, development and production. Mineral resource companies that are in the exploration stage have not yet found mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities, and are engaged in exploring land in an effort to discover them. Mineral resource companies that have located a mineral resource in commercially exploitable quantities and are preparing to extract that resource are in the development stage, while those engaged in the extraction of a known mineral resource are in the production stage. We have not found any mineral resources in commercially exploitable quantities. 

&#160; 

There is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties, and further exploration is required before we can evaluate whether any exist and, if so, whether it would be economically feasible to develop or exploit those resources. Even if we complete our current exploration program and we are successful in identifying a mineral deposit, we would be required to spend substantial funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we could know whether that mineral deposit will constitute a commercially viable mineral deposit, known as an &#8220;ore reserve.&#8221; 

&#160; 

To date, we have not generated any revenues. Our ability to pursue our business plan and generate revenues is subject to our ability to obtain additional financing, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to do so. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are a mineral resource company engaged in the business of mineral exploration. We compete with other mineral resource exploration companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in mineral resource exploration companies. The presence of competing mineral resource exploration companies may impact our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our property acquisitions and exploration programs if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment offered to investors. 

&#160; 

We also compete for mineral properties of merit with other exploration companies. Competition could reduce the availability of properties of merit or increase the cost of acquiring additional mineral properties. 

&#160; 

Many of the resource exploration companies with whom we compete may have greater financial and technical resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of properties of merit and on exploration of their properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of resource properties. This competition could result in our competitors having resource properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and to senior exploration companies that may purchase resource properties or enter into joint venture agreements with junior exploration companies. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance property acquisitions and further exploration. 

&#160; 

Compliance with Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the States of Arizona and Alaska. 

&#160; 

We are required to perform annual assessment work in order to maintain the Big Chunk mining claims. If annual assessment work is not performed, we must pay the assessment amount in cash in order to maintain the claims. Completion of annual assessment work in the amount of $400 per 1/4 section (160 acre) claim or $100 per 1/16 section (40 acre) claim extends the claims for a one year period. Assessment work performed in excess of the required amount may be carried forward for up to 4 years to reduce future obligations for assessment work. Since we have in excess of the required amount remaining from work performed within the four year period, assessment work was not required, but was and will be carried forward up to 4 years. 

&#160; 

The annual state rentals for the Big Chunk mining claims vary from $70 to $680 per mineral claim and escalate with the age of the mining claim. The rental period begins at noon September 1 st through the following September 1 st and annual rental payments are due on November 30 th of each year. Annual rent is due in full within 45 days of staking a new claim and covers the period from staking until the next September 1 st . The rentals of $6,120 to extend the Big Chunk claims through September 1, 2015 were paid in November 2014. The estimated state rentals due for the Big Chunk claims were not paid for 2016, but we may remedy that up to November 2016 by paying rentals due. Alaska State production royalty is three percent of net income. State law prescribes that after a 3.5 -year exemption from state taxes, a metal mine is liable for a 15% state licensing tax on net income from the mine. 

&#160; 

Our North Pipes claims are federal lode mining claims located on U.S. federal lands and administered by the Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management (the &#8220;BLM&#8221;). The BLM has prepared an environmental impact statement (&#8220;EIS&#8221;) addressing potential for contamination of significant amounts of uranium leaking into the Colorado River. The EIS indicated the danger of such contamination insignificant. Regardless, the United States Secretary of the Interior, Kenneth Salazar, through executive order, has withdrawn federal lands from locatable mineral exploration and mining North of the Grand Canyon along the Utah border in Arizona, the so-called &#8220;Arizona Strip&#8221;. Nearly 1 million acres of land managed by the BLM and the Forest Service were segregated in July 2009 by the Secretary of Interior. The executive order has resulted in the withdrawal of an area of the Arizona Strip from mining in particular, and the moratorium now is instated for the next 20 years. However, the moratorium permits existing claims and mines to continue as before, including our North Pipes lode mining claims. 

&#160; 

We are required to pay annual rentals to maintain our North Pipes federal lode mining claims in good standing. The rental period begins at 12:01 PM on September 1 st through the following September 1 st at 12:00 PM, and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period starting at 12:01 PM. The annual rental is $155 per claim. Additional fees of $57 per claim are due in the first year of filing a federal lode mining claim along with the first year&#8217;s rent. The rentals of $1,705 for the period from September 1, 2015 to September 1, 2016 have been paid. The annual rentals due by September 1, 2016 of $1,705 are required to maintain the North Pipes claims for the period from September 1, 2016 through September 1, 2017. There is no requirement for annual assessment or exploration work on the federal lode mining claims, this having been supplanted by the rental fee. There are no royalties associated with the federal lode mining claims.

&#160; 

We are required to pay annual rentals for our federal lode mining claims for our East Silver Bell project in the State of Arizona. The rental period begins at noon on September 1 st through the following September 1 st , and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. The annual rental is $155 per claim. The rental fees of $4,030 for the period from September 1, 2015 to September 1, 2016 have been paid. The annual rentals due by September 1, 2016 of $4,030 are required to maintain the East Silver Bell claims are for the period from September 1, 2016 through September 1, 2017. There is no requirement for annual assessment or exploration work on the federal lode mining claims, this having been supplanted by the rental fee. There are no royalties associated with the federal lode mining claims. 

&#160; 

We are required to pay annual rentals for our federal lode mining claims for our Tombstone project in the State of Arizona. The rental period begins at noon on September 1 st through the following September 1 st , and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. The annual rental is $155 per claim. Additional fees of $57 per claim are due in the first year of filing a federal lode mining claim along with the first year&#8217;s rent. The rental fees of $14,725 for the period from September 1, 2015 to September 1, 2016 have been paid. The annual rentals due by September 1, 2016 of $ $14,725 are required to maintain the Tombstone claims for the period from September 1, 2016 through September 1, 2017. There is no requirement for annual assessment or exploration work on the federal lode mining claims, this having been supplanted by the rental fee. There are no royalties associated with the federal lode mining claims. Beginning September 1, 2011 at 12:01 PM, Liberty Star started, and subsequently completed, staking 9 federal lode mining claims along the east edge of old patented mining claims in the main producing part of the old Tombstone mining area. These new claims are adjacent to the south end of the Walnut Creek TS claim block and are also named the TS claims. These claims occupy fractional land areas open to location by federal lode mining claims. 

&#160; 

We are required to pay annual rentals for our Arizona State Land Department (&#8220;ASLD&#8221;) Mineral Exploration Permits (&#8220;AZ MEP&#8221;) at our Tombstone Hay Mountain Project in the State of Arizona. A mineral exploration permit is permission from ASLD to prospect and explore for minerals on State Trust land. Exploration is any activity conducted for the purpose of determining the existence of a valuable mineral deposit, such as: geologic mapping, drilling, geochemical sampling, and geophysical surveys. Prior to exploration, the Plan of Operations must be approved by ASLD. The permitting process for an exploration permit takes a minimum of 60 days. If the application is approved, the initial rent is $2 per acre. If renewed, no additional rents are due for the second year. Rents are set at $1 per acre for years 3 thru 5. Work expenditure requirements are: $10 per acre for years 1-2; and $20 per acre for years 3-5. Removal of any minerals or materials from State Trust land without the appropriate lease or permit is prohibited. The permit is valid for one year from the due date of the rental and bond. If renewal requirements are met, the permit can be renewed annually for up to five years. If discovery of a valuable mineral deposit is made, the permittee must apply for a mineral lease before actual mining activities can begin. A mineral lease permits the mining of minerals discovered under the exploration permit. The approval process takes a minimum of six months. The mineral lease is issued for a term of 20 years. Leases may be renewed for an additional term. Both rents and royalties are determined by appraisal. Royalties may be based on: 1) a fixed rate subject to annual adjustment; or 2) a sliding-scale rate which is linked to a commodity index price and the operation's break-even price. There is a statutory minimum royalty rate of 2% of gross value. These AZ MEPs require a reclamation bond of $3,000 which we currently hold. The first year&#8217;s rental has been paid for these MEPs and the escalating rental is due on the anniversary of the MEP each year. After the end of the 4th year, the MEPs must transition to a State Mineral Lease upon satisfaction of the State Mineral Inspector that economic indications of a minable deposit exist. After commencement of mining, the State of Arizona shall be paid a minimal net smelter return after taking into consideration any extenuating mining challenges royalty but not less than a 2% gross royalty. The rental period begins on September 30 through the following September 29 and rental payments are due by the first day of the rental period. We hold AZ MEP permits for 1,886.88 acres at our Tombstone project. Required minimum work expenditures for the period ended September 29, 2016 are $37,737. The annual rentals and renewal fees due by September 30, 2016 to maintain the AZ MEP permits are $3,886.88. 

&#160; 

With respect to the foregoing properties, additional approvals and authorizations may be required from other government agencies, depending upon the nature and scope of the proposed exploration program. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the size, quality of any resource or reserve at this time, and it is extremely difficult to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings or our competitive position. 

&#160;
