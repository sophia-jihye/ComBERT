 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a biotherapeutic company focused on developing a human hepatic cell-based treatment targeting acute forms of liver failure. Our product candidate, the ELAD &#174; &#32; System, is an extracorporeal human allogeneic cellular liver therapy designed to allow the patient&#8217;s own liver to potentially regenerate to a healthy state, or to stabilize the patient until transplant. The ELAD System is the only liver support system containing immortal human liver-derived cells, or VTL C3A cells, to enter phase 3 clinical trials. We designed the ELAD System to supplement key aspects of normal liver function to improve patient survival. We estimate that at least 40,000 patients annually in the United States, or U.S., experience the acute forms of liver failure that may be addressed by the ELAD System, such as severe acute alcoholic hepatitis, or sAAH, surgery-induced liver failure, or SILF, and fulminant hepatic failure, or FHF, for a portion of which the ELAD System may be a life-saving therapy. Except for liver transplant, which is severely limited by the availability of organs and not available to many patients, the current standard of care for these acute forms of liver failure is primarily focused on the management of complications, which does not restore lost liver function and is associated with a high rate of mortality. The ELAD System has received orphan designation in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of patients with acute liver failure. This designation provides tax credits for qualified clinical testing, seven years of market exclusivity in the U.S. and ten years of market exclusivity in Europe for the first orphan drug approved for a given indication. However, orphan designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements or the process for obtaining marketing approval. 

In late 2015, we initiated a new phase 3 clinical trial in sAAH, referred to as VTL-308. VTL-308 is a phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, pivotal study, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with sAAH. It is based on pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of our VTI-208 phase 3 clinical trial in alcohol-induced liver decompensation, or AILD, of which sAAH is a subset. Although VTI-208 failed to reach either its primary or secondary endpoints, our analyses identified criteria for a group of subjects in which favorable survival trends were observed. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the VTL-308 trial are based on these findings. We expect to report top-line data for VTL-308 around mid-2018. 

Vital Therapies, Inc. was formed in May 2003 to acquire the assets of VitaGen (formerly Hepatix) in a bankruptcy proceeding. Our predecessor companies developed the ELAD System, completing two pilot trials and two randomized, controlled phase 1 and phase 2 trials predominantly in subjects with FHF, but failed to attract funds sufficient to continue development of the ELAD System. Beginning in June 2004, we refocused the company to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of the ELAD System in China. In 2007, we completed a pivotal trial in subjects suffering from several forms of liver failure, principally viral hepatitis B, and we submitted an application for marketing in China. Our application is still under review in China. However, based on our current understanding of the regulatory environment, we do not expect activity or approval by the regulatory authorities in China unless and until we have approval in the U.S. 

We restarted our clinical program in the U.S. and Europe in 2008. We ran two phase 2 trials in forms of acute liver failure, and selected AILD and sAAH as indications for our phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. We also made significant improvements in the ELAD System reusable delivery device and our proprietary production process, including (i) the incorporation of an updated version of the extracorporeal pumping unit with improved features, functionalities and reliability; (ii) new and improved cartridges for ultrafiltration, cell filters and the ELAD C3A cell cartridges; (iii) tubing sets optimized to recirculate smaller volumes of ultrafiltrate and blood through the system to reduce the risk of clotting and other potential adverse side effects; and (iv) improvements to our cell culture and growth processes to reduce cost and increase manufacturing efficiency and yield. 

In early 2013, we began enrollment in our phase 3 clinical trial, VTI-208, in subjects with AILD and, in January 2015, completed enrollment of 203 subjects, the majority of whom were diagnosed with sAAH. During 2014, we initiated enrollment in a second phase 3 trial, VTI-210, for subjects with sAAH and a phase 2 clinical trial, VTI-212, for subjects with FHF or SILF. The VTI-210 trial was suggested by the European regulatory authority and was intended to include subjects who had failed conventional therapy and were therefore a sicker population than the VTI-208 subjects. 

The VTI-208 study included 203 AILD subjects in the intention-to-treat, or ITT, population, with 96 and 107 subjects randomized to ELAD treatment and control (standard of care only) groups, respectively. In August 2015, we learned that the Kaplan-Meier analysis of the overall survival in the ITT population was not statistically different between groups. However, in a pre-specified subset of 120 subjects with Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores &#60;28 that consisted of 51 and 69 subjects in the ELAD-treated and control groups, respectively, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival did approach statistical significance. In another pre-specified exploratory analysis of 101 subjects with less than the median age of 46.9 years, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival also favored the ELAD-treated subjects. Analyses of 83 subjects with MELD scores &#62;28 and of 102 subjects greater that the median age both favored the control subjects. A subject&#8217;s MELD score is a tool for characterizing the severity of liver disease and for providing a prognosis for survival. 

These VTI-208 analyses provided the rationale for our new VTL-308 phase 3 clinical trial in sAAH. The baseline criteria for VTL-308 include subjects with MELD &#60;30 and age &#60;50. In addition, as suggested by other pre-specified VTI-208 subset analyses, subjects with acute renal dysfunction, defined as serum creatinine &#8805;1.3 mg/dL, and severe coagulopathy, defined as an international normalization ratio (INR) &#62;2.5, are excluded from this new study. Baseline serum total bilirubin (a measure of liver function) also must be &#8805;16 mg/dL in order to ensure a sufficient degree of liver disease severity. Applying these and key safety criteria to the analysis of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the ITT population, and assuming that this prospectively-defined population behaves similarly to this subgroup of the VTI-208 study along with other assumptions outlined in the statistical plan, a sample size for VTL-308 of 75 subjects in each the ELAD and control groups is consistent with a power of at least 95%. 

We expect to enroll at least 150 subjects in VTL 308 at about 40 sites in the United States and Europe. Sites have been selected based on their high enrollment in the VTI-208 trial or their demonstrated capability to enroll these types of subjects. The first subject is projected to be enrolled in the first half of 2016, and we expect to report top-line data for VTL-308 around mid-2018. The VTL-308 phase 3 has been designed to demonstrate statistical significance based on the subset results of the VTI-208 trial. However, there can be no assurance that the data from the trial or that a single trial will be sufficient to support a marketing application in any country. 

Considering the results of the VTI-208 clinical trial and in an effort to focus our personnel and financial resources, we discontinued the VTI-210 and VTI-212 clinical trials, postponed most activities associated with the preparation for filing a biologics license application, or BLA, and reduced our workforce in late 2015. 

The ELAD System consists of four disposable ELAD C3A cell cartridges containing our human liver-derived C3A cells attached to a reusable delivery device using customized disposable tubing sets. The delivery device is based on a cardio-pulmonary bypass machine, which we have configured for the ELAD System treatment. This unit and customized disposable sets are attached to the ELAD C3A cell cartridges where the patient&#8217;s blood plasma is treated by our VTL C3A cells before being returned to the patient. Treatment will generally consist of a single session of continuous allogeneic cellular therapy lasting between three and five days. 

The four ELAD cartridges collectively contain about 440 grams, or approximately one pound, of VTL C3A cells from our proprietary cell bank. We employ proprietary methods designed to manufacture large quantities of these cells consistently and cost-effectively. These cells have been shown to retain many key synthetic and metabolic processes of normal human hepatocytes, the primary functional cell of the liver. As the treatment with our VTL C3A cells is not patient-specific, we avoid the costly logistical and production challenges typically associated with autologous cellular therapies. To our knowledge, other liver treatments of this type that have reached late-stage clinical trials have been either acellular or contained pig cells. We believe that human liver cells are necessary to replicate key aspects of the intricate biology of normal human liver function. 

During clinical studies of ELAD, a total of 260 subjects have received treatment with the ELAD System, including earlier configurations of the system, in ten clinical studies and through a compassionate use program. Early clinical trials of the ELAD System carried out prior to the VTI-208 clinical trial were primarily designed to identify patient populations and clinical trial designs that were appropriate to pursue in pivotal clinical studies. Although they demonstrated trends towards increased survival, most of the trials carried out prior to VTI-208 were not designed to be adequately powered to demonstrate statistically significant increased survival. For example, randomized controlled clinical trials (PS-0698 and CR-202) conducted in subjects with FHF, suggested that the ELAD System may have value in bridging subjects listed for liver transplant to transplant, thereby potentially improving survival. 

Data from a 69-subject randomized, controlled clinical trial (VTIC-301) performed at two hospital centers in Beijing, China, primarily in subjects with an acute form of liver failure caused by viral hepatitis B, showed a statistically significant difference in 28-day and 56-day transplant-free survival rates in the ELAD-treated group as compared with the control group using the pre-defined Log Rank test, a statistical test that compares the survival distributions of the two study groups. This technique is widely used in clinical trials to document the efficacy of a new treatment compared to a control treatment when the measurement is the time to event (such as the time from initial treatment to death, or to a liver transplant). Data from a subset comprising the first 49 subjects in this clinical trial revealed a statistically significant difference in 84-day survival using a more sensitive analytical technique, the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. This test is another statistical method used in the analysis of clinical trial data that compares two populations, for example, in respect to their survival times. 

Two further randomized controlled trials (VTI-201 and VTI-206) were conducted primarily in U.S. subjects to help better define the population that would be appropriate for study in pivotal clinical trials. The outcomes of these studies suggested that the maximum disease severity should be limited in subjects treated with ELAD and also that subjects in whom alcohol was the predominant factor leading to their acute liver failure were a particularly suitable population for study in pivotal clinical trials. 

We own exclusive worldwide commercial rights to the ELAD System free of royalties. If marketing applications are submitted and approved, we intend to commercialize the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe with a targeted sales force focusing on liver transplant centers and other specialist intensive care centers. We intend to opportunistically pursue markets outside the U.S. and Europe either through direct sales or collaborations. We also believe that the ELAD System may have potential use in other forms of acute liver failure, such as that caused by viral hepatitis B, for liver resection support and for liver transplant support, although we have generated limited clinical data to support these indications. 

We are currently the owner of record of five issued U.S. patents and over a dozen issued or allowed foreign patents, including countries in Europe, Asia and Australia. Additionally, we are the owner of record of seven pending U.S. provisional patent applications. One granted U.S. patent claims a method of using C3A cells to treat a patient&#8217;s blood. The patent has a term that extends to 2027 and may possibly be extended further if the patent is determined to be eligible for patent term extension. Additionally, a second granted U.S. patent includes claims to an extracorporeal device configuration which is cell type independent and which we believe encompasses our ELAD System. The patent has a term that extends to 2025 and may possibly be extended further if the patent is determined to be eligible for patent term extension. Moreover, if approved, the ELAD System will be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity in the U.S. under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2012, or the 2012 Act. Finally, orphan designation provides market exclusivity for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in Europe upon regulatory approval, but this would run concurrently with the 2012 Act exclusivity in the U.S. 

Our Strategy 

Key elements of our business strategy include the following: 

&#8226; 

Successfully complete the ELAD System&#8217;s clinical development in severe acute alcoholic hepatitis (sAAH) subjects . For VTL-308, we expect to enroll at least 150 subjects in an event-driven clinical design (a statistical plan that allows the study sample to be adjusted according to aggregate mortality) among roughly 40 sites in the United States and Europe, with first patient enrollment projected to occur in the first half of 2016, and we expect to report top-line data for VTL-308 around mid-2018. 

&#8226; 

Obtain regulatory approval for the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe . If our VTL-308 clinical trial is statistically and clinically successful, we plan to submit a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. An additional phase 3 trial may or may not be required for these approvals. 

&#8226; 

Maximize the commercial potential of the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe . If approved, we intend to directly commercialize the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe with a targeted sales force focusing on liver transplant centers and other specialist intensive care centers. We believe that we can price the ELAD System in a range consistent with other currently marketed lifesaving therapies, such as left ventricular assist devices, orphan biologic medications for hereditary metabolic diseases and monoclonal antibody medications for cancer. 

&#8226; 

Opportunistically explore commercial opportunities for the ELAD System in other international markets . We have completed a trial for the ELAD System that may be considered pivotal in China. The study predominantly enrolled subjects with viral hepatitis B, and our application for marketing approval, filed in 2007, is still under review. However, we do not currently anticipate receiving approval in China prior to our receipt of regulatory approval, if any, in the U.S. or Europe. We would expect to address the commercial opportunity in China following approval in the U.S. or Europe. We also plan to evaluate commercial opportunities in Australia, Japan, India, other Asian markets, the Middle East, Brazil and Africa. 

&#8226; 

Pursue development of the ELAD System in additional indications . If the ELAD System is approved for use in patients with sAAH, we may pursue the ELAD System&#8217;s clinical development in viral hepatitis B, FHF, SILF and bridge-to-transplant. 

&#8226; 

Technical Improvements and New Applications . We plan to continue our development of the ELAD System with the incorporation of technical improvements to our ancillary delivery device, customized disposable sets, and cells. In addition, we plan to explore the development of next generation systems and other uses for VTL C3A cells, including the potential commercialization of proteins and other C3A-produced compounds. 

Our ELAD System Product Candidate 

ELAD System 

The ELAD System is a phase 3 investigational, extracorporeal human hepatic cell-based liver treatment designed to supplement hepatic function in order to potentially improve survival rates among patients with acute forms of liver failure. The ELAD System consists of four disposable ELAD C3A cell cartridges attached to a reusable ancillary delivery device using customized disposable tubing. The four ELAD cartridges collectively contain approximately eight thousand hollow fibers and approximately one pound of VTL C3A cells from our proprietary cell bank. 

The figure below is a schematic of the ELAD System: 

During ELAD treatment, an extracorporeal pumping unit draws blood from the subject via a central venous line which then passes into the system to generate ultra-filtrated plasma (ultrafiltrate). The subject&#8217;s ultrafiltrate is pumped through the hollow fibers of the cartridge, wherein the semipermeable membrane permits a bidirectional flow between the cells (grown between the exterior of the hollow fibers) and the ultrafiltrate (contained in the lumen of the hollow fibers). Toxins, nutrients and dissolved gases pass from the ultrafiltrate to the cells, while the potentially beneficial macromolecules and other substances synthesized by the cells simultaneously pass into the subject&#8217;s ultrafiltrate. 

After circulation through the ELAD C3A cell cartridges, the ultrafiltrate passes through a 0.2-&#181;m pore size filter, is recombined with the cellular components of the subject&#8217;s blood, and is returned to the subject via the central venous line. VTL C3A cells&#8217; metabolic byproducts are thereby returned to the subject to be utilized or to be excreted by the renal or gastrointestinal system. This circulation can be maintained continuously for the duration of the ELAD treatment for up to five days, as determined by the treating physician. The ELAD System monitors and enables adjustment of glucose and oxygen concentrations in the ultrafiltrate, as well as temperature and other parameters, in order to maintain the viability of the C3A cells. 

Our Proprietary VTL C3A Cell Bank 

The liver is a complex organ comprising several different cell types to perform the majority of its biochemical functions, with hepatocytes being most widely recognized for their roles in synthesis and metabolism. Hepatocyte viability is limited when cultured or expanded outside the body as they very quickly de-diffferentiate or die. Therefore, normal hepatocytes present practical and logistical obstacles for use in a liver-assist product. Cell lines derived from liver cells can alleviate many of these practical and logistical obstacles. The specific cell line that was selected for the allogeneic ELAD System, the VTL C3A cell line, is a sub-clone of a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2. The C3A cell line was developed at Baylor College of Medicine and deposited at the American Type Culture Collection. The specific cells stored in our proprietary cell banks and their progeny are referred to as VTL C3A cells. Under the right conditions, VTL C3A cells rapidly proliferate, allowing growth of the large amount of cells necessary to treat the subject with a liver support system, and with cells that remain metabolically active during treatment. Each ELAD treatment uses approximately one pound of cells. 

Treatment with the ELAD System is not patient-specific and our VTL C3A cells, which are derived from a single source, are used to treat all patients. This process is known as allogeneic cellular therapy. In contrast, autologous cellular therapy uses a patient&#8217;s own cells, which are manipulated in individual production batches, a costly and complex process. As a result, the production and logistics of treatment with our VTL C3A cells does not face some of the challenges commonly associated with autologous cellular therapies. 

The VTL C3A cell bank has been subjected to rigorous safety testing for adventitious agents in accordance with regulatory guidance documents. This bank contains enough cells to enable our clinical development and commercialization. We own this VTL C3A cell bank exclusively and on a royalty-free basis. In addition, we have developed proprietary methods for growing, storing and optimizing the function of these cells. 

Our proprietary VTL C3A cell bank is stored in three separate locations around the world for security purposes and is used as the basis for growing the cells needed for each patient at our production facility in San Diego, California. 

ELAD Mechanism of Action 

While the mechanism(s) of action for the ELAD System have not been fully elucidated, several mechanisms are currently under investigation. All this work has been done in vitro &#32;and none has yet been related to patient clinical responses. 

The VTI C3A cells may: 

1. 

Provide acute-phase response proteins to help dampen the pro-inflammatory environment and restore the patient&#8217;s immune responses. &#32;The cells secrete several anti-inflammatory proteins, including alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), the latter of which is upregulated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines typically found in alcoholic hepatitis patients. In addition, VTL C3A cells secrete gelsolin, which others have suggested may help dampen inflammation in response to damaged cells. 

2. 

Promote liver regeneration by providing factors known to be associated with liver repair. &#32;The cells secrete a number of proteins involved in angiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, placental growth factor and angiopoietin 2. VEGF is reported to stimulate other cells to secrete hepatocyte growth factor, a known hepatocyte growth promoter, and we believe VEGF may be beneficial by providing improved vascularity to damaged liver sinusoids. Other factors secreted by VTL C3A cells that may be of importance for regeneration include transforming growth factor alpha, stem cell factor, erythropoietin, and platelet-derived growth factor. 

3. 

Produce blood coagulation factors to address blood clotting imbalances that are common in alcoholic hepatitis patients. &#32;Factor V, Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, Factor XII, fibrinogen, prothrombin, antithrombin III, Protein C and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 have been shown to be produced by the VTL C3A cells. 

4. 

Assist in in the restoration of liver function by providing liver-specific metabolism and detoxification capabilities. &#32;The VTL C3A cells express messenger RNA, or mRNA, for cytochrome P450, or CYP, isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which are collectively responsible for metabolizing nearly 90% of all drugs. Moreover, this CYP expression appears to respond dynamically as evidenced by different expression patterns in VTL C3A cells exposed to different clinical subjects. 

While a statistically significant reduction in bilirubin has been demonstrated in subjects over the five days of ELAD treatment, the VTL C3A cells have not been shown to conjugate bilirubin in the normal method of human excretion in our in vitro &#32;studies. This may be because the VTL C3A cells lack the ability to actively transport bilirubin into the cells. However, bilirubin has been shown to be sequestered by the VTL C3A cells, which may help contribute to reducing overall bilirubin levels in ELAD-treated subjects. 

VTL C3A cells have also been shown to express mRNA for bile acid gene targets involved in synthesis, conjugation and transport functions. However, bile acid metabolism appears to be moderate in comparison to the cholestatic environment (a condition in which substances normally excreted into bile are retained) of alcoholic patients, based on initial studies. 

Further studies are underway to characterize ELAD's mechanisms of action. 

Differentiating Factors of the ELAD System 

Unlike other potential therapies developed for acute forms of liver failure in the past, we believe the ELAD System has a unique combination of attributes: 

&#8226; 

Biologically active . The ELAD System contains biologically active VTL C3A cells and is designed to replicate many liver functions. We believe that an acellular solution to liver failure is unlikely to effectively replace lost liver function. We believe that a cellular approach like ours, capable of replicating key biologic processes, is best able to provide the requisite flexibility and breadth of function to sufficiently supplement liver function and improve survival in patients with acute liver failure. 

&#8226; 

Human cellular therapy . The ELAD System is based on human cells, which confer a considerable advantage over non-human, animal-based cell therapies. Given the widespread availability of animal tissues, much work has been done on the use of animal liver cells, often derived from pigs, to treat humans with liver failure. While immunological risk is always present in cellular therapy, the use of non-human animal tissues presents greater immunological risk compared to human cellular therapy. Humans possess naturally occurring antibodies that react with antigens on porcine cell surfaces. These antibodies can mount an immediate attack in the presence of porcine cells, causing these cells to rapidly lose function and die. Moreover, repeated treatments with a porcine cell may cause subsequent immune responses to become increasingly severe. The infusion of porcine enzymes into a patient&#8217;s blood stream also poses immunologic risk. We are not aware of any FDA-approved, non-human animal-based cellular therapy for use in patients. 

&#8226; 

Commercially scalable . Our VTL C3A cells used in the ELAD System are immortal and can be expanded in quantities to scale production. Each set of four cartridges used to treat a single patient is grown in a production process that takes about six weeks. The process is carefully controlled and is performed under ultra-clean conditions to avoid contamination in our current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant production plant. The process is scalable by modular units. 

&#8226; 

Minimal manipulation needed by site . Prior to shipment, the ELAD cartridges are put into a dormant state and shipped under cool conditions. They have been validated to survive for up to 60 hours before being used for treatment. When the hospital receives the cartridges, they are unpacked by our ELAD System specialists on site, placed on the system, flushed with saline and are ready to be used for patient treatment. Our VTL C3A cells usually remain viable for the duration of the patient treatment. 

Liver Failure 

The liver performs a wide variety of vital life functions including metabolic, regulatory, detoxification and synthetic activities. The primary liver cell, the hepatocyte, is believed to be responsible for approximately 500 or more specific biologic processes. In addition, the liver also serves as a reservoir for immune cells which clear the blood of pathogens. As a result, the liver&#8217;s failure to perform its normal role can have devastating or fatal consequences. Causes of liver failure are numerous, and the condition is typically described in terms of rapidity of onset. The two main categories are acute liver failure and chronic liver failure. In the US, according to the Center for Disease Control, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis represented the twelfth leading cause of death in 2013. In China, where viral hepatitis is endemic, liver and liver-related disease including liver cancer and hepatitis B represented the fifth leading cause of death in 2014. 

Alcohol-Induced Liver Decompensation (AILD) and Severe Acute Alcoholic Hepatitis (sAAH) 

AILD arises when the cause of the acute liver decompensation appears to be directly related to excessive consumption of alcohol. A specific, well-defined subset of AILD is sAAH, generally defined as progressive inflammatory liver disease, leading to an acute form of alcohol-induced liver injury that occurs with the consumption of large amounts of alcohol in patients with relatively mild, underlying chronic alcoholic liver disease. The majority of subjects enrolled in our studies of AILD meet the definition of sAAH. 

Various degrees of fibrosis and hepatitis are present in AILD patients. Those patients with characteristics of acute alcoholic hepatitis, or AAH, and a Maddrey Discriminant Function (a calculation used to predict the prognosis of alcoholic hepatitis) of &#8805;32 are deemed to have sAAH. A second subset of AILD patients (non-AAH AILD) may have underlying chronic liver disease due to other etiologies, but the cause of their acute decompensation is considered to be related to excessive alcohol consumption. In sAAH, there appears to be sufficient hepatocyte mass to allow hepatic regeneration and reversal of the decompensation. It can be discriminated from patients with end-stage liver disease by measurements of liver size using imaging techniques such as ultrasound or CT scan as they tend to present with enlarged livers, rather than with the shrunken livers characteristic of subjects with end-stage liver disease. 

Treatment options for patients with sAAH are limited. In particular sAAH patients with a Maddrey Discriminant Function of &#62;32 have a poor prognosis, with 90-day survival of around 50%. Regimens that have been used for the past 40 years, including corticosteroids, theophylline with corticosteroids, pentoxifylline and infliximab have had no significant effect on the long-term survival of patients with sAAH. Steroid use has been associated with an increased rate of infections, a frequent complication of liver failure. Other contraindications to steroid use in patients with sAAH include active gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, acute pancreatitis, active tuberculosis, uncontrolled diabetes and psychosis. Subjects who do not respond to seven days of steroid therapy have a particularly dismal prognosis, with six-month survival rates of less than 25%. A recent study of more than 1,100 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of sAAH demonstrated a reduction in 28-day mortality in subjects administered steroids that did not reach statistical significance, with no improvement in survival at 90 days or one year. This study also revealed no survival benefit at any time point for pentoxifylline relative to placebo. Typically, subjects with sAAH are not eligible for a liver transplant until at least six months of sobriety has been demonstrated. 

The Department of Health and Human Services in the U.S. estimates that for 2013 the number of hospital admissions related to sAAH in the U.S. was approximately 95,000, with approximately 14,000 of these admissions identifying sAAH as the primary diagnosis. In addition, approximately 310,000 hospital admissions occurred in 2013 related to alcoholic cirrhosis, alcohol liver damage not-otherwise-specified or alcoholic fatty liver, with approximately 48,000 hospital admissions identifying these conditions as the primary diagnosis. We believe that a subset of these patients have a form of non-sAAH AILD that may be treatable with the ELAD System. Incidence rates for both sAAH and non-sAAH AILD appear to be similar in Europe. 

Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) 

Hepatocellular damage, secondary to a variety of insults (infectious agents, alcohol, exogenous drugs autoimmunity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis etc.), can result in chronic liver disease, if the underlying etiology is not effectively treated. This condition is characterized histopathologically by increasing degrees of fibrosis and cirrhosis, and frequently remains subclinical or undiagnosed. Often as a result of a secondary insult, the liver can decompensate, leading to a life-threatening disorder known as acute-on-chronic liver failure, or ACLF. 

The damage to the liver from continuing insults causes the gradual development of fibrosis in the liver over time, which results in a decrease of both liver function and the ability to regenerate after decompensation. The fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis when this process continues for many years. The progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis results in a shrunken liver, distortion of hepatic lobules, and continued loss of hepatocytes (due to replacement with fibrotic tissue) that leads to progressive and recurrent episodes of decompensation. This progressive loss of hepatocyte mass impairs the liver&#8217;s inherent ability to regenerate following decompensation. 

Fulminant Hepatic Failure (FHF) 

Another form of acute liver failure is FHF, a relatively rare condition characterized by a rapid deterioration of liver function with altered mental state and coagulopathy in individuals without known pre-existing liver disease. The most frequent causes include drug or toxin-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, autoimmune disease and hypoperfusion. Two thousand cases of FHF are estimated to occur in the U.S. each year. The standard of care includes liver transplantation and these patients get priority on the liver transplant list although they tend to progress very rapidly and may succumb to their disease before a suitable organ becomes available. We believe the ELAD System may provide these patients with a bridge-to-transplant, or potentially, recovery without transplantation. 

Surgery-Induced Liver Failure (SILF) 

Another form of acute liver failure is SILF, which is comprised of three varieties, as follows: 

1. 

Primary Graft Non-Function, which occurs when a newly transplanted liver fails to function. This is a life threatening medical emergency, and can lead to death if a new organ does not become available quickly. We believe the ELAD System may provide patients with a bridge-to-transplant until a second liver becomes available. 

2. 

Small-For-Size or Split Liver Transplant occurs when the transplanted liver is functioning, but may be too small to sustain the patient, either because only a small donor liver was available, or because a live person donated a portion of their liver for transplantation. We believe the ELAD System may be able to support the patient&#8217;s liver function until the donated organ regenerates to a size large enough to become independent of external support. Moreover, the ELAD System may also enable transplantation of smaller liver fragments than typically used, potentially expanding the available pool of donor organs. 

3. 

Other forms of SILF. Primary liver cancer can sometimes be cured by resecting the cancerous part of the liver after which the remaining liver regenerates to full size. Currently, surgeons will typically only resect up to 50% of the liver in order to avoid death from liver failure. However, more extensive resections occasionally occur, and resection of smaller portions can also lead to liver failure. We believe the ELAD System may be able to support these patients while their liver regenerates and may also enable surgeons to perform larger tumor resections. 

We estimate that the first two categories of SILF account for several hundred patients a year in the U.S., while the third category could represent an annual population of 10,000 or more cases a year in the U.S. 

Chronic Liver Failure 

Chronic liver failure refers to a gradual loss of liver function and is usually characterized by the presence of widespread cirrhosis, which refers to the replacement of normal liver tissue by fibrosis, scar tissue and regenerative nodules. As normal liver tissue is destroyed, the organ gradually fails to perform its normal metabolic, regulatory and synthetic functions. Unfortunately, damage from cirrhosis cannot be reversed and lost liver function can only be regained through transplantation. For this reason, we do not believe that the ELAD System would be effective for cirrhotic patients other than possibly to bridge these patients to transplant. 

Limitations of Currently Available Treatment Options for Acute Forms of Liver Failure 

Given the liver&#8217;s complexity, there are no simple or widely effective medical solutions to acute forms of liver failure. The only long-term cure for acute liver failure is surgical transplantation. As published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there were 6,729 liver transplants performed in the US in 2014. Also, according to a research report on the 2014 U.S. organ and tissue transplant cost estimates from Milliman, one of the world's largest providers of actuarial and related product services, the average billable charge for a liver transplant in 2014, including the one month before surgery and six months after surgery, was $739,100. There are approximately 15,000 patients currently on the transplant waiting list and approximately 1,500 patients die while waiting each year. Similarly, there are approximately 7,000 liver transplants performed per year in Europe. Outside of transplant, current therapy is defined by the treating facility and is mostly supportive and designed to manage the symptoms and complications associated with acute liver failure. 

Pharmaceuticals 

N-acetylcysteine is approved by the FDA for the prevention of acute liver injury following the ingestion of toxic amounts of acetaminophen. Other treatments, including steroids and pentoxifylline, are often used off-label to manage symptoms associated with acute forms of liver failure, although steroids in particular have been shown to increase the risk of potentially fatal infections. Results from the Steroids or Pentoxifylline for Alcoholic Hepatitis study, or STOPAH, were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) meeting in November 2014. STOPAH enrolled 1,103 subjects with sAAH at 65 sites in the U.K., but failed to demonstrate any significant benefit in the primary analysis of overall survival for subjects treated with either steroids, pentoxifylline or a combination of the two at one, three or twelve months, as compared with placebo. In a secondary, multivariate analysis of the data, a small benefit was observed for those subjects taking steroids at one month, although this benefit was not seen in multivariate analyses at either three months or at twelve months. Despite the availability of these treatments, the mortality rate for acute forms of liver failure remains above approximately 40%. There are no known mechanisms for pharmacologically addressing liver failure specifically or restoring lost liver function. 

Liver Support Devices 

There are no medical devices approved for liver support that have been proven to improve survival in patients with acute forms of liver failure. Clinical trials have been conducted in recent years involving two acellular liver support devices that filter toxic metabolites from the blood. In 2004, Gambro acquired the Molecular Adsorbents Recirculation System, or MARS, a liver dialysis system. However, in 2010, a randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing MARS to standard of care among 189 subjects with a variety of forms of liver failure failed to show any improvement in 28-day survival for subjects treated with MARS. Likewise, in 2010 a similar liver support device, Prometheus, developed by Fresenius SE &#38; Co. KGaA, also failed to show an improvement in either 28-day or 90-day survival in a randomized, controlled trial among 145 subjects with various forms of liver failure. MARS is currently cleared as a device in the U.S. for use in hepatic encephalopathy, drug overdoses and poisoning cases. MARS and Prometheus are both commercialized in Europe under CE marks. In 1999-2000, Circe Biomedical, Inc. ran a 171-subject randomized, controlled clinical trial predominantly in FHF using a liver support device that incorporated live pig liver cells. The trial did not meet its 30-day survival endpoint.

The ELAD System&#8217;s Clinical Development in AILD/sAAH 

VTI-208 

In August 2015, we announced that the VTI-208 clinical trial did not achieve its primary endpoint of overall survival through study day 91. In the extended follow-up of the VTI-208 subjects, referred to as VTI-208E, we have an additional five months of survival data as of December 31, 2015. The year end 2015 survival data continues to support the August 2015 conclusions (N=203; Kaplan Meier: p-value 0.986, hazard ratio 1.000). 

Kaplan Meier Curve for VTI-208/VTI-208E Overall Survival at December 31, 2015 

Adjusting for one subject who withdrew and two lost to follow-up, 95 subjects remained in the VTI-208E extension study at December 31, 2015 and are being monitored annually for survival, transplant and cancer for up to five years. As is frequently the case in large trials with lengthy follow-up, nineteen of the subjects are late for follow-up visits. In these cases, the prior follow-up data for these subjects were used in our analysis. 

Pre-specified subgroup analyses of overall survival were conducted on medically-pertinent baseline demographic factors to identify the extent of influence these known factors had, if any, on the overall study outcome. These factors had been previously identified as potential influences on outcome based on scientific considerations, including the outcomes of the STOPAH study (Thursz 2015), results from the CLIF-SOFA consortium (Arroyo 2015), and previous ELAD clinical data. Results of these subgroup analyses revealed that overall survival outcomes in the ITT population were substantially influenced by MELD score and, to a lesser degree, age. 

The MELD score is a numerical scale, ranging from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill), developed for use in liver transplant candidates age 12 and older. It gives each person a &#8216;score&#8217; (number) based on how urgently he or she needs a liver transplant within the next three months. The number is calculated by a formula using three routine lab test results: 

- bilirubin, which measures how effectively the liver excretes bile; 

- INR (prothrombin time), which measures the liver&#8217;s ability to make blood clotting factors; and 

- creatinine, which measures kidney function. (Impaired kidney function is often associated with severe liver disease.) 

The specific formula is as follows: 

MELD = 3.78&#215;ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2&#215;ln[INR] + 9.57&#215;ln[serum creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43 

The MELD score has also been used to assess mortality risk in other types of liver dysfunction, including sAAH. For example an sAAH patient with a MELD score of 28 is projected to have a 54% chance of dying over a period of 90 days. 

The pre-specified subgroup analysis of MELD, evaluated as a dichotomous variable of &#60;28 and &#8805;28, identified two distinct populations with respect to ELAD treatment outcomes versus the control group: in subjects with lower MELD scores, treatment outcomes favored ELAD, and, in the mirrored population with higher MELD scores, outcomes shifted in favor of the control group. Data revealed clinically-meaningful differences as shown by p-value and hazard ratio, or HR, favoring ELAD in the primary endpoint of overall survival up to at least study day 91 in a large subset of subjects with MELD scores &#60;28 (N=120; Kaplan Meier at December 31, 2015: p-value=0.070, HR 0.580). This was also observed in the secondary endpoint of proportion of survivors at study day 91 (N=120; survival: ELAD 80.4% versus control 65.2%, Pearson's chi-squared: p-value=0.068). For those subjects with MELD scores &#8805;28, the opposite outcome was observed in overall survival (N=83; Kaplan Meier at December 31, 2015: p-value=0.121, HR 1.557) and in the secondary endpoint of proportion of survivors at study day 91 (N=83; survival: ELAD 35.6% versus control 55.3%, Pearson's chi-squared: p-value=0.072). 

Kaplan Meier Curve for VTI-208/VTI-208E Overall Survival MELD &#60;28 and &#62;=28 at December 31, 2015 

A more granular post-hoc analysis of MELD score parameters as compared to outcome revealed an important directional association between MELD scores and relative overall survival outcomes. These additional pre-specified and post-hoc analyses helped to discriminate the contribution of each of the individual MELD parameters (bilirubin, creatinine, and INR) on these dichotomized outcomes. Results indicate that higher creatinine and INR levels, reflective of kidney injury and coagulopathy, respectively, are the key drivers associated with less favorable ELAD treatment outcomes compared with controls. The reduced tolerance of subjects with evidence of acute kidney injury and coagulopathy appears to be due to an interventional effect of the extracorporeal administration of ELAD. The limits set in VTI-208 to control the impact of extracorporeal treatment on subjects with secondary organ dysfunction, which had been established based on these critical indicators from our prior datasets, have been set lower in VTL-308. 

Although less pronounced than the impact of MELD scores on overall survival, subject age was also identified in a pre-specified subgroup analysis as a demographic factor found to influence study outcomes. In subjects with less than the median age of 46.9 years, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival favored ELAD (N=101; Kaplan Meier at December 31, 2015: p-value=0.116, HR 0.591). This was also observed in the secondary endpoint of proportion of survivors at study day 91 with ELAD survival of 81.4% versus control survival of 67.2% (Pearson's chi-squared: p-value=0.112). In those subjects with greater than the median age, the opposite outcome was observed in overall survival. This finding is consistent with the liver resection literature indicating that the liver&#8217;s capacity for regeneration diminishes with age. This effect appears to be somewhat exacerbated if there is evidence of acute kidney injury or coagulopathy.

VTL-308 

Based on our pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of VTI-208 subsets, we have initiated a new phase 3 clinical trial in sAAH, referred to as VTL-308. VTL-308 is a phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, pivotal study, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with sAAH who meet criteria based on the data from the pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of the VTI-208 clinical trial. 

The key changes from the VTI-208 clinical trial protocol include restrictions on subjects&#8217; age, MELD score and the three components of the MELD score associated with kidney dysfunction (creatinine), blood clotting dysfunction (INR) and liver function (bilirubin). MELD score is an algorithm used to predict 90-day patient survival in liver disease. The VTL-308 inclusion criteria have been established to reflect the same study population as that enrolled in a subset of the VTI-208 population with baseline criteria including MELD &#60;30, age &#60;50, INR &#8804;2.5, creatinine &#60;1.3mg/dL and serum total bilirubin &#8805;16mg/dL. Data from this post-hoc analysis indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between treated and control subjects in the primary endpoint of overall survival in this population (N=60; Kaplan Meier at December 31, 2015: p-value=0.006, HR 0.278). This was also observed in the secondary endpoint of proportion of survivors at study day 180 (N=60; survival: ELAD 93.1% versus control 61.3%, Pearson's chi-squared: p-value=0.004). 

Kaplan Meier Curve for VTI-208/VTI-208E Overall Survival MELD &#60;30, Age &#60;50, INR &#60;=2.5, creatinine &#60;1.3mg/dL and bilirubin &#62;=16 mg/dL at December 31, 2015 

The sample size for the VTL-308 study was defined by applying these criteria to the analysis of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the ITT population, and assuming: 1) that this prospectively-defined population behaves similarly to this subgroup of the VTI-208 study; 2) the use of a log-rank test (Kaplan Meier) comparing two survival curves with a two-sided significance level of 0.05; 3) exponential survival curves with proportional hazards; 4) uniform accrual with an accrual time of at least 720 days and a minimum follow-up time of 90 days; and 5) a drop-out rate of 10%. Based on these parameters, a sample size for VTL-308 of 75 subjects per each the ELAD-treated and control groups is consistent with power of at least 0.95 with estimated median survival times of 438 and 175 days, respectively. 

In November 2015, we received written responses from the FDA to our Type C meeting request on the planned VTL-308 clinical trial. At the FDA's suggestion, we have incorporated an event-driven feature into the trial design consistent with the primary endpoint of overall survival. Under the modified design, enrollment will continue until at least 150 subjects have been enrolled and 55 events have occurred, consistent with the event rate seen in the target subpopulation from VTI-208. 

In light of the FDA's guidance on trial design and other topics, the VTL-308 program remains on track. We expect to enroll subjects at about 40 sites in the United States and Europe. Sites have been selected based on their high enrollment in the VTI-208 trial or their demonstrated capability to enroll these types of subjects. Clinical sites are in the process of opening, with enrollment of the first subject expected in the first half of 2016, and we expect to report top-line data for VTL-308 around mid-2018. The VTL-308 phase 3 has been designed to demonstrate statistical significance based on the subset results of the VTI-208 trial; however, there can be no assurance that the trial will be successful or that a single trial will be sufficient to support a marketing application in any country. 

The ELAD System&#8217;s Clinical Development in Acute Flare of Viral Hepatitis 

VTIC-301 . Between 2006 and 2007, we enrolled 69 subjects with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in a randomized, controlled open-label trial at two hospitals in Beijing, China. Inclusion criteria focused the trial&#8217;s enrollment on subjects anticipated to have a 50% chance of death by 84 days, and the majority of enrolled subjects were experiencing an acute flare of viral hepatitis. The study was designed to enroll 120 subjects but was terminated early by one of the hospital&#8217;s ethics committee because, in light of the results discussed below, it would have been unethical to continue to treat control subjects with standard of care alone. Endpoints included survival at 14, 28, 56 and 84 days, as analyzed using a log-rank method. 

A significant protocol amendment was enacted after the enrollment of the first 49 subjects, in which inclusion criteria were changed, reducing the severity of disease, and a shorter ELAD System treatment time was recommended. This change in study design resulted in far fewer deaths or transplants in the second subset of 20 ELAD-treated and control subjects. A revised statistical plan was prepared to accommodate these differences in subject populations. Separate analyses were performed on the 49-subject subset and the full 69-subject population, and additional statistical analysis techniques were proposed, such as the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum techniques to analyze continuous variables such as survival time. 

Analysis of the first 49 subjects (32 subjects randomized to be treated with the ELAD System for three days along with standard of care for the treating institution and 17 subjects randomized to be treated with standard of care alone) revealed the following: 

&#8226; 

significant differences in 28 and 56-day survival using the log-rank test (p=0.015 and 0.026, respectively); (log-rank was not significant at 14 and 84 days, p=0.074 and 0.058, respectively); 

&#8226; 

significant differences in 84-day survival using the Wilcoxon test (p=0.049); and 

&#8226; 

no unexpected safety issues. 

Generally, the serious adverse events reported in this study were reflective of the severity of disease and co-morbidities present in the patient population. There were 16 post-treatment adverse events in eight of the 32 treated subjects that the investigators reported as possibly or probably related to treatment. 

These efficacy results are depicted in the below Kaplan-Meier curve: 

Analysis of all 68 subjects treated (44 subjects randomized to be treated with the ELAD System for one to three days along with standard of care for the treating institution and 25 subjects randomized to be treated with standard of care alone; note one control subject withdrew consent immediately following randomization and is not included in this analysis, so only 24 controls are included for a total of 68 subjects) revealed the following: 

&#8226; 

Significant differences in 28-day survival using the log-rank test (p=0.015); 

&#8226; 

No significant differences in 14, 56 and 84-day survival using the log-rank test; and 

&#8226; 

No unexpected safety issues. 

Based on these results, it was concluded that the Wilcoxon test is a more sensitive technique to elucidate differences between groups in the ELAD System clinical trials, and that a more severely diseased population and more extended treatment times should be evaluated in future clinical studies. Future clinical trials may be analyzed using the more conservative log-rank technique. 

One further observation from the 49 subjects in the first part of this study was that the ELAD System can significantly decrease bilirubin levels, an important biomarker of liver function in patients with ACLF. The overall magnitude of the decrease in mean end of treatment total bilirubin in the ELAD group was 25.1% (17.5 to 13.1 mg/dL) compared to an increase in the control group of 36.8% (17.1 to 23.4 mg/dL). Serum sodium, another biomarker associated with survival in subjects with ACLF, also was significantly improved in the subjects treated with the ELAD System relative to control subjects. 

These China pivotal trial data formed the basis of a submission for marketing approval to the China FDA, or CFDA, in September 2007. It should also be noted that this study was not designed, and will not be used, as a pivotal trial to support approval of the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe. 

Subsequent to the completion of the VTIC-301 clinical study, an additional protocol was prepared by the treating physicians to explore the long-term survival of subjects enrolled in this study. Following the grant of informed consent, subjects enrolled in VTIC-301 were contacted and invited to return to the treating hospital for examination for recurrence of liver disease or the incidence of cancer. This study was carried out in 23 and 22 subjects, respectively, three and five years following initial randomization. 

These data from the first 49 subjects suggest that the survival benefit (statistically significant at three years and five years, Kaplan Meier: p&#60;0.05, log-rank) afforded to those subjects treated with the ELAD System is maintained over a three and five-year period relative to those subjects in the control group. These trends are depicted in the Kaplan-Meier curves below: 

While these follow-up analyses were not prospectively defined in the VTIC-301 protocol, we believe they provide valuable information on the long-term survival of this group of patients. 

The results of VTIC-301 were submitted to the CFDA, for marketing approval in September 2007. However, a regulation enacted in 2009 prevents the approval of novel foreign medical products until they are approved in their home markets first. Accordingly, we would not expect activity or approval by the regulatory authorities in China unless and until we have approval in the U.S. 

Commercialization Strategy and Organization 

Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. If approved, we intend to directly commercialize the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe with a targeted hospital sales force and to either commercialize directly or utilize a variety of types of collaboration in other markets. 

Sales, Marketing and Reimbursement 

Following FDA and/or EMA approval, if any, we intend to launch the ELAD System commercially in the U.S. and Europe, respectively. We expect to direct our initial sales and marketing efforts at those sites which will have participated in our phase 3 clinical trials, and which we anticipate will exceed 40 in number. Subsequently, we plan to gradually expand our focus in the U.S. to approximately 100 liver-transplant centers, as well as to another 100 specialist intensive care centers with a similar penetration in Europe. We expect that our commercial infrastructure would be comprised of a targeted hospital sales force led by several experienced sales management personnel, an internal marketing and medical affairs staff, and a reimbursement support team. We currently intend to focus our initial commercial efforts on the U.S. and European markets, which we believe represent the largest and most readily addressable market opportunities for the ELAD System. In addition, we believe that Australia, China, Japan, India, other Asian markets, the Middle East, Brazil, and Africa represent significant opportunities because of the prevalence of liver disease in these geographies, and we intend to pursue the commercialization of the ELAD System in certain of these markets through collaborations. 

We expect the ELAD System to be reimbursed as an in-patient drug in the U.S. For patients eligible for Medicare, who we anticipate to constitute a minority of the ELAD System-addressable patients, reimbursement to the hospital is expected to occur under a diagnosis related group, which may be eligible for a New Technology Add-on Payment and outlier payments. We have begun the process to request appropriate codes and groupings for the ELAD System therapy from the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, which may take several years to complete, if successful. We have been notified by the American Medical Association, or AMA, that a temporary, or Category III, Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code for physician care oversight of an extra-corporeal liver system was accepted in February 2015, and which became effective on January 1, 2016. However, implementation of a permanent, or Category I, CPT code with a predetermined physician payment value is a lengthy process and is not expected to be complete until several years after potential marketing approval in the U.S. We also expect to work with private payors to develop appropriate case-rates for the ELAD System reimbursement in the U.S. We believe we will ultimately be able to price the ELAD System in a range consistent with other currently marketed life-saving therapies, such as left ventricular assist devices, orphan biologic medications for hereditary metabolic diseases, and monoclonal antibody medications for cancer. 

Manufacturing and Supply 

Our manufacturing facility is licensed as a drug and medical device manufacturer by the California Food and Drug Bureau. This facility was recently remodeled in 2014 in order to expand manufacturing capacity to support worldwide clinical trials and early marketing demands for the ELAD System. This remodel increased manufacturing clean room, quality control laboratory, and warehouse and refrigeration space. The increased clean room space will allow modular increases in the ELAD cartridge manufacture. 

At our facility, we manufacture the ELAD System, which is comprised of our proprietary VTL C3A cells, cartridges and the bedside unit. The system contains both reusable and disposable medical device components. We source certain components of the ELAD System from third-party suppliers. Most components of our ELAD System are FDA-cleared and CE marked. In a few cases, we manufacture a device or a device component ourselves. Based on discussions with the regulatory authorities, we have determined that all components will have to be submitted for approval for use with the ELAD System as part of the BLA. 

Training and Support 

We also expect to deploy a training and support team at the liver transplant and specialist intensive care centers that our sales and marketing team are expected to target. During the initial commercialization period, it will be essential for us to have our own trained staff present during the delivery of the ELAD System therapy. This may entail the construction and operation of training centers and will require the hiring of personnel of appropriate ability to be adequately trained. 

All biopharmaceutical production activities must be conducted under cGMP, the standards established by the FDA for pharmaceutical and biologics production. Medical devices must be manufactured in accordance with pertinent device regulations. The equipment used in the manufacturing process is based on designs typically encountered in the production of other biotechnology products, and has been customized to tailor their use to the ELAD System production. The ELAD cartridges and bedside units are tested according to the FDA&#8217;s and other applicable regulatory bodies&#8217; standards before they can be released for use in humans. All device components shipped from us to our investigational sites are subject to quality control inspection. 

Future Commercialization Opportunity 

The VTL C3A cells which we grow in our facility produce large quantities of proteins and other cell products, such as albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, C3 complement, anti-thrombin 3, factor V, factor VII, fibrinogen, and transferrin. Many of these compounds have known or potential industrial and/or therapeutic applications. In the future we plan to explore the commercialization potential for these compounds, although we do not expect to generate revenues in this area in the near-term. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that we have a patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to the ELAD System. Our patent portfolio includes patents with claims directed to our ELAD System, specific clonal cells and cell-lines derived from human liver-derived C3A cells, as well as methods of growing such cells. We are currently the owner of record of five issued U.S. patents and over a dozen issued or allowed foreign patents. Additionally, we are the owner of record of seven pending U.S. provisional patent applications. One granted U.S. patent claims a method of using C3A cells to treat a patient&#8217;s blood. The patent has a term that extends to 2027 and may possibly be extended further if the patent is determined to be eligible for patent term extension. Additionally, a second granted U.S. patent includes claims to an extracorporeal device configuration which is cell type independent and which we believe encompasses our ELAD System. The patent has a term that extends to 2025 and may possibly be extended further if the patent is determined to be eligible for patent term extension. Foreign counterparts of these patents have been issued in countries throughout the world, including, for example, in Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea and Taiwan. Furthermore, related applications remain pending in certain other jurisdictions including, for example, Europe, Brazil, China, India and the Philippines. 

We strive to protect the proprietary technology that underlies the ELAD System. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for the ELAD System, its methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. 

A predecessor company initially developed the ELAD System after the technology was spun out of Baylor College of Medicine in 1990. In 2003, we acquired substantially all of the assets of the predecessor, including trade secrets, know how, clinical experience and key employees and facilities. Among those assets was a U.S. patent, which we had exclusively licensed from Baylor, which is now expired. 

Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, and the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets as well as our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also expect to rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional priority application. In the U.S., a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. 

The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the biologic is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of our BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions. 

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. This includes our methods of expanding, culturing and optimizing the performance of the human VTL C3A cell line. 

Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

We seek trademark protection in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. where available and when appropriate. We have registered trademark rights for Vital Therapies in the U.S. and Australia and for ELAD in the U.S., Europe and Australia. 

Competitive Environment 

The biotherapeutic and medical device industries are highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and we face potential competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, medical device developers and biotechnology companies worldwide, many of which have longer more established operating histories, and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, sales and distribution and other resources than us. Given the significant unmet medical need for novel therapies to treat acute liver failure, many companies, public and private universities and research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery and research and development of potential products in this field. Several of these entities are engaged in research on cell-based approaches to acute liver failure. Although we are not aware of any ongoing human clinical trials involving potentially competitive product candidates in the U.S. or Europe, such trials could be taking place or could begin in the near future. In addition, these entities compete with us for limited resources including personnel, trial sites and potential complementary assets. 

We are not aware of any company that is in human clinical trials with a human cell-based product for the treatment of patients with ALF. At least four companies have conducted prior research on various human hepatocyte cell lines including Exten Industries, Hepalife Technologies, Fresenius and Hybrid Organ GmbH. In addition, the University College London, the University of Amsterdam and its spinout Hep-Art Medical Devices, and researchers affiliated with the Mayo Clinic are actively pursuing animal research in this area and may begin clinical trials in the near future. 

Several companies have also attempted to develop extracorporeal therapy based upon primary porcine hepatocytes, although ongoing research in this area is difficult to ascertain. 

Two commercially available liver dialysis systems, from Gambro and Fresenius, have undergone extensive clinical development, although both have failed to show an improvement in long-term survival among patients with ALF. Both rely on not only traditional dialysis circuits to remove water-soluble toxins, but also albumin dialysis circuits to remove albumin-bound molecules. A recent publication by Larsen et al reported that high volume plasma exchange can improve in a cohort of Western subjects with ALF. 

In addition, there are several drugs used to treat symptoms associated with acute liver failure, including steroids, pentoxifylline and N-acetylcysteine. These drugs, alone or in combination, are used frequently in patients with acute liver failure. 

Government Regulation 

We operate in a highly-regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, among others. Biologics and medical devices are subject to regulation under the PHS Act and FDC Act. 

Regulation of Combination Products 

The FDA has specified a definition for the term &#8220;combination product,&#8221; which includes: (1) a product comprised of two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (2) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (3) a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (4) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 

The FDA is divided into various &#8220;Centers&#8221; by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that the FDA determine the combination product&#8217;s primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple evaluations is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center. 

The ELAD System is regulated as a combination biologic/device in the U.S. Based upon the proposed mechanism of action, the primary Center within the FDA responsible for its regulation is the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. The CBER office responsible for review is the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the marketing application will be a BLA. CBER will consult with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, in reviewing the device components of the ELAD System. 

FDA Approval Process 

In the U.S., pharmaceutical and biological products and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act, PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of these products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending license applications, warning and other letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 

Preclinical Studies 

Biological product development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an investigational new drug application, or IND, along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 

A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 

Clinical Studies 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or subjects with the targeted indication, or disease, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practices, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The clinical trial protocol, protocol amendments and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB&#8217;s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 

Sponsors of clinical trials of investigational products are required to register on clinicaltrials.gov, a National Institute of Health website registry database, and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 

Marketing Approval 

Clinical trials to support BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the investigational biologic candidate into healthy human subjects, the investigational biologic is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited subject population, to determine the effectiveness of the investigational biologic for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers. 

If an investigational biologic demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide adequate information for its labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the biologic for use in a specific indication or population. A single phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multi-center trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 

After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#8217;s manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is subject to a substantial application fee and the manufacturer or sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologics products are reviewed within twelve months of submission; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within eight months of submission. Priority review for biologics is limited to those products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease with unmet medical need relative to the currently approved products. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 

The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologics products or biologics products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory, including compliance with applicable parts of the medical device Quality System Regulation, or QSR, as defined for combination products, and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure and potent in the indication studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA&#8217;s general biological product standards. 

After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, including additional large-scale clinical testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product&#8217;s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product&#8217;s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems or safety issues are identified following initial marketing. 

Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, device components or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. 

Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as phase 4 testing, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as product manufacturing, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP&#8217;s after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with applicable regulations such as cGMPs and the QSR. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP&#8217;s. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 

Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products 

Biosimilar Exclusivity 

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation which are still being evaluated by the FDA. 

A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar&#8217;s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 

Orphan Drugs 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Privacy and Transparency Laws 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of federal and state laws in the U.S. have been applied to restrict certain business operations and activities in the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries in recent years. These laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: 

The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return, for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, service or item for which payment is made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for a statutory exception or a regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Recently, the civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Medicaid Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of supplier or provider Medicare numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of drugs or off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug&#8217;s label, and misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered or items provided. The federal criminal false claims law prohibits, among other things, at any time knowingly and willingly making, or causing to be made, any false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining rights to a benefit or payment under a federal healthcare program. 

Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor (e.g. private payors). Sanctions under federal, and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws may include, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare program, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 

Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, which, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes and regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, private payors. In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. 

The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened many of these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA), among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities may not satisfy the statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors and we could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. State law equivalents to these federal laws may also apply. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act provisions implemented in final regulation requires applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report such data to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. Other state laws require pharmaceutical companies to adopt and or disclose specific compliance policies to regulate the Company&#8217;s interactions with healthcare professionals. Moreover, some states, such as Minnesota and Vermont, also impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. 

Violations of some of these laws may result in substantial fines. These laws affect promotional activities by limiting the kinds of interactions we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of our products. Both the disclosure laws and gift bans impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us. Although we seek to structure our interactions in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how a law will be applied in specific circumstances. If an employee were to offer an inappropriate gift to a customer, we could be subject to a claim under an applicable state law. Similarly if we fail to comply with a reporting requirement, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. In addition to the federal and state disclosure and gift ban laws, certain countries outside of the U.S. have similarly enacted disclosure laws for which the company in its activities may be subjected to from time to time. 

Regulation in the European Union 

Biologics and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation outside of the U.S. In the European Union, for instance, a centralized approval procedure, or Centralized Procedures, may be used to authorize the marketing of a product in all countries of the European Union, which includes most major European markets. However, for certain products, if this procedure is not used, approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in a second country of the European Union under two simplified application processes, either the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure. Both of these procedures rely on the principle of mutual recognition. In addition to regulatory approval, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries. 

In Europe, the ELAD System is regulated as a Combination Somatic Cell Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, or ATMP. The primary regulatory license application in Europe (a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA), if any, will be made to The Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, and the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, which are the committees at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that are responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs. Marketing Authorization Applications for ATMPs can only be filed using the Centralized Procedure. The CHMP and the CAT liaise closely together so the CHMP is able to make a scientific opinion relating to the authorization to place an ATMP on the market in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 and pharmacovigilance. The CAT has also established collaborations with Notified Bodies, or NBs, in Europe in order to review the device components of combination device products, and we anticipate that the device components of our submission would be reviewed by one of those NBs. Currently, during the clinical trial phase in Europe, we are granted authorization to conduct clinical studies at the national level through the health authority agencies in each country, each of which has its own format and regulation for the issuance of clinical trial authorizations, or CTAs. For some countries, it is necessary to obtain separate authorizations in each country for each clinical trial protocol from the medicines and device agencies as there is yet to be developed a procedure for dealing with combination products like the ELAD System. The EMA has provisions for providing companies with advice on topics related to marketing authorization in Europe through the Scientific Advice Working Party, or SAWP. Previously, we sought and obtained advice on the ELAD development program through the SAWP process. We anticipate obtaining further guidance and advice through future interactions with the SAWP. 

In other jurisdictions we anticipate that there will be different requirements for authorization for clinical trials and ultimately marketing of the ELAD System due to the complex nature of the combination of biological and device components of our ELAD System. 

Other Regulations 

We are also subject to numerous, federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control, environmental protection and the disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and their related regulations now or in the future. In addition, we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign countries outside of the U.S. and Europe where we may seek to commercialize the ELAD System. In certain cases, these foreign laws and regulations may change at inopportune times and prevent the ELAD System&#8217;s timely commercialization. For example, several years after we submitted our 2007 regulatory package in China, we were notified of a then-newly-enacted 2009 regulation which prohibits the ELAD System&#8217;s approval in China until it is first approved in the U.S. As such, we now do not expect regulatory consideration of approval in China until after approvals are received in the U.S.
