 Item 1. &#160; &#32;Business 

Brixmor Property Group Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;BPG&#8221;) is an internally-managed real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;). Brixmor Operating Partnership LP and subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;) is the entity through which BPG conducts substantially all of its operations and owns substantially all of its assets. BPG owns 100% of the common stock of BPG Subsidiary Inc. (&#8220;BPG Sub&#8221;), which, in turn, is the sole member of Brixmor OP GP LLC (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;), the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; as used herein refer to each of BPG and the Operating Partnership, collectively. We operate the largest wholly-owned portfolio of grocery-anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers in the United States. Our portfolio is comprised of 518 shopping centers totaling approximately 87 million square feet of gross leasable area (the &#8220;Portfolio&#8221;). 517 of these shopping centers are 100% owned. Our high quality national Portfolio is well diversified by geography, tenancy and retail format, with 72% of our shopping centers anchored by market-leading grocers. Our four largest tenants by annualized base rent are The Kroger Co., The TJX Companies, Inc., Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., and Wal-Mart Stores. Our community and neighborhood shopping centers provide a mix of necessity and value-oriented retailers and are primarily located in the top 50 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, surrounded by dense populations in established trade areas. 

As of December 31, 2015, BPG beneficially owned, through its direct and indirect interest in BPG Sub and the General Partner, 98.3% of the outstanding partnership common units of interest in the Operating Partnership (&#8220;OP Units&#8221;). Certain investments funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. (together with such affiliated funds, &#8220;Blackstone&#8221;) and certain members of the Company's current and former management collectively owned the remaining 1.7% of the outstanding OP Units. Holders of OP Units (other than BPG Sub and the General Partner) may redeem their OP Units for cash based upon the market value of an equivalent number of shares of BPG&#8217;s common stock or, at our election, exchange their OP Units for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. The number of OP Units in the Operating Partnership beneficially owned by BPG is equivalent to the number of outstanding shares of BPG&#8217;s common stock, and the entitlement of all OP Units to quarterly distributions and payments in liquidation is substantially the same as those of BPG's common stockholders. BPG&#8217;s common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the ticker symbol &#8220;BRX.&#8221; 

Because the Operating Partnership is managed by BPG, and BPG conducts substantially all of its operations through the Operating Partnership, we refer to BPG&#8217;s executive officers as Operating Partnership&#8217;s executive officers, and although, as a partnership, the Operating Partnership does not have a board of directors, we refer to BPG&#8217;s board of directors as the Operating Partnership&#8217;s board of directors. 

Recent Developments 

On February 8, 2016, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the &#8220;February 8-K&#8221;) reporting the completion of a review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Brixmor Property Group Inc. (the &#8220;Audit Committee&#8221;). The Audit Committee&#8217;s review began after the Company received information in late December 2015 through its established compliance processes (the &#8220;Audit Committee review&#8221;). The Audit Committee review led the Board of Directors to conclude that specific Company accounting and financial reporting personnel, in certain instances, were smoothing income items, both up and down, between reporting periods in an effort to achieve consistent quarterly same property net operating income growth, an industry non-GAAP financial measure. 

As reported in the February 8-K, following the Audit Committee review, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer resigned from all positions with the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, an accounting employee also resigned. Following these resignations, the Board of Directors appointed Daniel B. Hurwitz as interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Barry Lefkowitz as interim Chief Financial Officer and Michael Cathers as interim Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Hurwitz also replaced the Company&#8217;s former chief executive officer as a member of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

For additional information concerning the findings of the Audit Committee review and related management changes, see the Company&#8217;s Form 8-K filed February 8, 2016 and Form 8-K filed February 16, 2016. For additional

Business Objectives and Strategies 

Our primary objective is to maximize total returns to our stockholders through a combination of growth and value-creation at the asset level supported by stable cash flows. We seek to achieve this through ownership of a large high quality, diversified portfolio of primarily grocery-anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers and by creating meaningful net operating income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;) growth from this portfolio. The major drivers of this growth will be a combination of positive rent spreads from below-market in-place rents and above average lease rollover, occupancy increases, annual contractual rent increases across the portfolio and the execution of embedded anchor space repositioning / redevelopment / outparcel development opportunities. Our key strategies to achieve these objectives are summarized as follows and detailed below: 

&#8226; 

Leveraging our operating expertise to proactively lease and manage our assets 

&#8226; 

Capitalizing on below-market expiring leases 

&#8226; 

Achieving occupancy increases 

&#8226; 

Pursuing value-creating anchor space repositioning / redevelopment / outparcel development opportunities 

&#8226; 

Preserving portfolio diversification 

&#8226; 

Maintaining a flexible capital structure positioned for growth 

Leveraging our Operating Expertise to Proactively Lease and Manage our Assets. &#32;We proactively manage our shopping centers with an emphasis on driving high rents and occupancy rates with a solid base of nationally and regionally recognized tenants that generate substantial daily traffic. Our expansive relationships with leading retailers afford us early access to their strategies and expansion plans, as well as to their senior management. We believe these relationships, combined with the national breadth and scale of our portfolio, give us a competitive advantage as a key landlord able to support the real estate strategies of our diverse landscape of retailers. Our operating platform, along with the corresponding regional and local market expertise, enables us to efficiently capitalize on market and retailing trends. We also seek opportunities to refurbish, renovate and redevelop existing shopping centers, as appropriate, including expanding or repositioning existing tenants. 

We direct our leasing efforts at the corporate level through our national accounts team and at the regional level through our field network. We believe this strategy enables us to provide our national and regional retailers with a centralized, single point of contact, facilitates reviews of our entire shopping center portfolio and provides for standardized lease templates that streamline the lease execution process, while also accounting for market-specific trends. 

- &#32;6 &#32;- 

Capitalizing on Below-Market Expiring Leases . Our focus is to unlock opportunity and create value at the asset level and increase cash flow by increasing rental rates through the renewal of expiring leases or re-leasing of space to new tenants with limited downtime. As part of our targeted leasing strategy, we constantly seek to maximize rental rates and improve the tenant quality and credit profile of our portfolio. We believe our above average lease expiration schedule, as compared to our historic annual expirations, with below-market expiring rents will enable us to renew leases or sign new leases at higher rates. During 2015 in our Portfolio, we experienced new lease rent spreads of 41.6% and blended new and renewal lease spreads of 14.9%. For the last six quarters ended December 31, 2015, blended lease spreads have been 13% or better. We believe that this performance will continue given our future expiration schedule of 9.9% of our leased GLA due to expire in 2016, 13.7% in 2017 and 12.6% in 2018, with an average expiring ABR/SF of $12.20 compared to an average ABR/SF of $12.78 for new and renewal leases signed during 2015, with an average ABR/SF of $15.86 for new leases and $11.88 for renewal leases. This represents a significant opportunity to mark a substantial percentage of the portfolio to market. 

Achieving Occupancy Increases. During 2015 we experienced strong leasing productivity in our Portfolio and executed 664 new leases for an aggregate of approximately 3.0 million sq. ft., including 65 new anchor leases for spaces of at least 10,000 sq. ft. Our continued efforts to improve the quality of our anchor tenants have driven our small shop leasing and for spaces of 10,000 sq. ft. or less, occupancy has increased to 84.3% at December 31, 2015 from 82.6% at December 31, 2014. Our total occupancy decreased to 92.6% at December 31, 2015 from 92.8% at December 31, 2014, due to certain tenant bankruptcies and proactive repositioning of anchor space. We believe that there is additional opportunity for further occupancy gains in our portfolio, across both our anchor and small shop space, and that as we continue to reposition our anchor tenants such improvement will drive strong new and renewal lease spreads and enable us to lease additional small shop space. 

Pursuing Value-Creating Anchor Space Repositioning / Redevelopment / Outparcel Development Opportunities. &#32;We evaluate our Portfolio on an ongoing basis to identify value-creating anchor space repositioning / redevelopment / outparcel development opportunities. These efforts are tenant-driven and focus on renovating, re-tenanting and repositioning assets and generally present higher risk-adjusted returns than new developments. Such efforts, which we refer to as our &#8220;Raising the Bar&#8221; initiative, are focused on upgrading our centers with strong, best-in-class anchors and transforming such properties&#8217; overall merchandise mix and tenant quality. Potential new projects include value-creation opportunities that have been previously identified within our Portfolio, as well as new opportunities created by the lack of meaningful community and neighborhood shopping center development in the United States. We may also seek to acquire non-owned anchor spaces or retail buildings and outparcels at, or adjacent, to our shopping centers in order to facilitate anchor space repositioning / redevelopment projects. In addition, as we own a vast majority of our anchor spaces greater than 35,000 sq. ft., we have important operational control in the positioning of our shopping centers in the event an anchor ceases to operate and flexibility in working with new and existing anchor tenants as they seek to expand or reposition their stores. 

During 2015, we completed 41 anchor space repositioning / redevelopment / outparcel development projects in our Portfolio, with average targeted NOI yields of 16%. The aggregate cost of these projects was approximately $89.8 million. We expect average targeted NOI yields of 11% and an aggregate cost of $104.6 million for our 44 currently active anchor space repositioning / redevelopment / outparcel development projects. 

As a result of the historically low number of new shopping center developments in the United States, repositioning and redevelopment opportunities are critical in allowing us to meet space requirements for new store growth and accommodate the evolving prototypes of our retailers. We expect to maintain our current pace of anchor space repositioning / redevelopment / outparcel development projects over the foreseeable future. We believe such activity is critical to the success of our company, as it drives higher sales and traffic, elevates center appeal, stimulates small shop leasing, improves rent levels and NOI and increases shopping center value. We intend to fund these efforts through cash from operations. 

Preserving Portfolio Diversification. &#32;We seek to achieve diversification by the geographic distribution of our shopping centers and the breadth of our tenant base and tenant business lines. We believe this diversification serves to insulate us from macro-economic cycles and reduces our exposure to any single market or retailer. 

The shopping centers in our Portfolio are strategically located across 38 states and throughout more than 170 MSAs, with 65.3% of our ABR derived from shopping centers located in the top 50 MSAs with no one MSA accounting for more than 6.7% of our ABR, in each case as of December 31, 2015. 

- &#32;7 &#32;- 

In total, we have approximately 5,500 diverse national, regional and local retailers with approximately 10,000 leases in our Portfolio. As a result, our 10 largest tenants accounted for only 18.1% of our ABR, and our two largest tenants, The Kroger Co. and The TJX Companies, together accounted for only 6.5% of our ABR as of December 31, 2015. Our largest shopping center represents only 1.5% of our ABR as of December 31, 2015. 

Maintaining a Flexible Capital Structure Positioned for Growth. &#32;Our current capital structure provides us with financial flexibility and capacity to fund our current capital needs as well as future growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2015, we had, in addition to our secured mortgage debt, $2.1 billion of unsecured term loans, a $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility under which we had $834.0 million of undrawn capacity and $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes. 

We believe we have access to multiple forms of capital, including unsecured corporate level debt, preferred equity, our at-the-market equity offering program and additional credit facilities, which will provide us with a competitive advantage over smaller, more highly leveraged or privately-held shopping center companies. We currently have investment grade credit ratings from all three major credit rating agencies. 

We intend to continue to enhance our financial and operating flexibility through ongoing commitment to ladder and extend the duration of our debt, and further expand our unencumbered asset pool. 

The strategies discussed above are periodically reviewed by our Board of Directors and while it does not have any present intention to amend or revise its strategy, the Board of Directors may do so at anytime without a vote of the Company&#8217;s shareholders. 

Competition 

We face considerable competition in the leasing of real estate, which is a highly competitive market. We compete with a number of other companies in providing leases to prospective tenants and in re-leasing space to current tenants upon expiration of their respective leases. We believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location, co-tenants and physical conditions of our shopping centers. In this regard, we proactively manage and, where and when appropriate, redevelop and upgrade, our shopping centers, with an emphasis on maintaining high occupancy rates with a strong base of nationally and regionally recognized anchor tenants that generate substantial daily traffic. In addition, we believe that the breadth of our national portfolio of shopping centers, and the local knowledge and market intelligence derived from our regional operating team, as well as the close relationships we have established with certain major, national and regional retailers, allow us to maintain a competitive position. 

Environmental Exposure 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operations conducted on real property. Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property or may have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property and, therefore, may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our property or disposed of by us or our tenants, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). Such liability may be imposed whether or not we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of these hazardous or toxic substances. As is common with community and neighborhood shopping centers, many of our properties had or have on-site dry cleaners and/or on-site gasoline retailing facilities. These operations could potentially result in environmental contamination at the properties. The cost of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. 

We are aware that soil and groundwater contamination exists at some of our properties. The primary contaminants of concern at these properties include perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene (associated with the operations of on-site dry cleaners) and petroleum hydrocarbons (associated with the operations of on-site gasoline retailing facilities). There may also be asbestos-containing materials at some of our properties. While we do not expect the environmental conditions at our properties, for which exposure has been mitigated through insurance coverage specific to environmental conditions, considered as a whole, to have a material adverse effect on us, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Further, no assurance can be given that any environmental studies performed 

- &#32;8 &#32;- 

have identified or will identify all material environmental conditions that may exist with respect to any of the properties in our portfolio. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 447 employees. Four of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good. 

Financial Information about Industry Segments 

Our principal business is the ownership and operation of community and neighborhood shopping centers. We do not distinguish or group our operations on a geographical basis when measuring performance. Accordingly, we believe we have a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). In the opinion of our management, no material part of our and our subsidiaries&#8217; business is dependent upon a single tenant, the loss of any one of which would have a material adverse effect on us, and no single tenant accounts for 5% or more of our consolidated revenues. During 2015, no single shopping center and no one tenant accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated assets or consolidated revenues. 

REIT Qualification 

We made a tax election to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011 and expect to continue to operate so as to qualify as a REIT. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on net taxable income that we distribute annually to our stockholders. In order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. In order to comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. See &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items.&#8221;
