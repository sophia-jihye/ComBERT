 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 6, 2006. In October 2006 we acquired Ralston Communications and Meeting Technologies from DirectView, Inc., a Nevada corporation of which our executive officers and directors were officers and directors immediately prior to such acquisition, in exchange for the assumption by us of these subsidiaries working capital deficiencies and any and all trade credit and other liabilities. Immediately prior to this transaction, in conjunction with the acquisition by DirectView, Inc. of all of the stock of another entity which resulted in a change of control of DirectView, Inc., our executive officers and directors resigned from their positions with DirectView, Inc. Both Ralston Communications and Meeting Technologies had historically provided the video conferencing services we continue to provide. Thereafter, in February 2007 we formed DirectView Security and in July 2007 we formed DirectView Video. On March 14, 2014, the Board of Directors and the majority shareholders approved and ratified the Company&#8217;s reincorporation merger from Delaware to Nevada, amongst other corporate actions disclosed in the Company&#8217;s Information Statement on Schedule 14C filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 8, 2014. In March of 2015, the Company completed a 1 for 30 reverse stock split of its common stock. 

&#160; 

Organization 

&#160; 

Directview Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;Directview Holdings&#8221;) was formed in October 2006. At that time DirectView Holdings acquired Ralston Communications Services, Inc., a Florida Corporation, (&#8220;Ralston Communications&#8221;) and Meeting Technologies, Inc. a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Meeting Tech&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Thereafter Directview Holdings formed Directview Security Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation (&#8220;Directview Security&#8221;) as a wholly owned subsidiary in February 2007 and Directview Video Technologies, Inc., a Florida corporation, (&#8220;Directview Video&#8221;) as a wholly owned subsidiary in July 2007. 

&#160; 

In November 2008, Homeland Integrated Security Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation (name changed to DirectView Technology Group, Inc. and referred to hereafter as &#8220;Technology Group) entered into an acquisition agreement with Directview Video Technology, Inc. a Florida corporation (&#8220;Directview Video&#8221;). The agreement includes a condition to ultimate consummation of the transaction, a 30-day clause which provided for termination of the agreement in the event any of the payment or exchanges were not finalized. Technology Group failed to pay the consideration within 30 days of acquisition which resulted in a termination of such agreement. Thus the closing of this transaction did not occur or consummate. As a result of these transactions and events, Technology Group, Roger Ralston and the DirectView companies did not complete the acquisition and integration of the DirectView companies with Technology Group, and there has been no relationship between the parties since that time. Mr. Ralston, our CEO, or any of the employees of Directview Holdings do not presently hold any position or ownership of Technology Group.

&#160; 

Video conferencing as a medium for business communications has provided opportunities to streamline complex business processes and to conduct transactions more efficiently. As a result, sophisticated audio or video-enabled interactive communications have become increasingly necessary as companies seek to become more efficient and effective. We seek to employ the technical knowledge of our management team to provide our clients with solutions for a wide range of applications suitable for a variety of industries. We have installation and integration experience with expertise in one-on-one or large, multi-sided group meetings, and we currently have installations ranging from very simple configurations to highly customized rooms with multiple cameras, document presentation stands, recording devices, scanners, and printers. 

&#160; 

5&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Initially we provide consultation to address and evaluate the project requirements and to offer expert advice on technology solution for our customer&#8217;s specific application. We assess the customer&#8217;s needs, desires and existing communications equipment, as well as cost-justification and return-on-investment analysis for system installations. Our products and services include multipoint video conferencing, network integration services, custom room design, staffing, document conferencing and IP/web conferencing services. 

&#160; 

A multipoint video conference is a video conference involving more than two sites. As a participant speaks, video is switched at all sites to broadcast the person speaking by a device called a multi-control unit. This switching unit is sound activated and can distinguish between short ambient sounds and long sustained sounds. It can also be set up in a &#8220;Hollywood Squares&#8221; type of look where all participants see each other. The call can also be set in a &#8220;chairperson mode&#8221; in which all sites see only the person heading the call. We offer multipoint bridge services to tie all of the locations, and we control this multipoint bridge. We outsource the remote access services which are incorporated into these multipoint video conferences to a variety of third party providers. We have no fixed agreements with such third party providers. Our base standard price is from $125 to $150 per hour per location which includes all costs related to these services. Where the client requests, we can staff a client assignment with one of our employees to manage all of the client&#8217;s video conferencing needs. The cost of this technical support varies from assignment to assignment. 

&#160; 

We offer a wide variety of network integration services to support our clients&#8217; planning, design, and implementation efforts in deploying new network technologies such as Internet protocol (IP), integrated services digital network (ISDN), a T-1 data transfer system or working with their existing network infrastructure. Our network integration services are designed to be comprehensive to ensure that all unique collaboration needs are met. Our services can include a full menu of services from initial order coordination with outside contractors or providers to liaison with local phone companies, installation, training, or can be customized for a particular job. Whether starting from scratch or working with an existing environment we can also provide all aspects of design and installation for video conferencing rooms, including room layout, furniture, built in wall monitors, custom audio and video as well as document collaboration such as T120 data conferencing and document camera and presentation stands. We will also design computer integration. Costs for these custom installations may vary based upon the layout and complexity of the job. 

&#160; 

We also offer our clients document conferencing and IP/Web conferencing services. Document conferencing affords the ability to bring people together to discuss, review and collaborate as a group, and to make on-line, real-time decisions regardless of the locations of the participants. IP/web conferencing services provides the client with a reliable and affordable way to share software applications, PowerPoint presentations, or anything running on a personal computer with others in online meetings. With these systems, meeting participants can view with clarity what is displayed on a desktop. We utilize third party software and applications such as Polycom and Sony to provide these services to our clients. 

&#160; 

When a video conferencing system is functional, we also provide training to all levels of the customer&#8217;s organization, including executives, managers, management information systems and data processing administrators, technical staff and end users. The training includes instruction in system operation, as well as the planning and administration of meetings. The training can last anywhere from one hour to two days, depending upon the level of training that the client requests or requires. All training costs are built into each sale where training is required. 

&#160; 

We are also a reseller of video conferencing products, including integrated video conferencing systems, video presentation products, flat screen monitors, iPower collaboration tools, Polycom view stations. We sell products from a variety of top manufacturers including Sony, Elggen, Fujitsu, Hitachi, JVC, NEC, Panasonic, Phillips, Pioneer, Samsung and ViewSonic. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

We are dependent on third parties for the supply and manufacturing of our subassemblies, components and electronic parts, including standard and custom-designed components. We generally do not maintain supply agreements with such third parties but instead purchase components and electronic parts pursuant to purchase orders in the ordinary course of business. We are dependent on the ability of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers to meet our design, performance and quality specifications. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our security systems division focuses a majority of its sales and marketing efforts in various industries to companies where there is space/room to be monitored by our surveillance camera systems. Our marketing efforts are done through direct sales force, referrals and our website . 

&#160; 

6&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our video conferencing products and services are marketed and sold to the commercial, government, medical and educational sectors through a direct sales force and through referrals. We currently have three sales agents in our direct sales force that works for commission. A majority of our sales comes from word of mouth and referrals. Sales of video conferencing products to resellers are made on terms with respect to pricing, payment and returns that are consistent with those offered to end user customers. No price protection or similar arrangement is offered, nor are the obligations as to payment contingent on the resale of the equipment purchased by the reseller. There are no special rights to return equipment granted to resellers, nor are we obligated to repurchase reseller inventory. 

&#160; 

We provide our security and surveillance and video conferencing sales force with ongoing training to ensure that it has the necessary expertise to effectively market and promote our business and solutions. In conjunction with manufacturer-sponsored programs, we provide existing and prospective customers with sales, advertising and promotional materials. Our technical and training personnel periodically attend installation and service training sessions offered by various manufacturers to enhance their knowledge and expertise in the installation and maintenance of the systems. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The security industry is highly competitive. We compete on a local and regional level with a small number of major firms and many smaller companies in the installed surveillance system space, and nationally in the direct to dealer space. We compete primarily on the quality of our service and the design and reliability of our products. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and financial resources than us. We may also face competition from potential new entrants into the security industry or increased competition from existing competitors that may attempt to develop the ability to offer the full range of services that we offer. We believe that competition is based primarily on the ability to deliver solutions that meet a client&#8217;s requirements and, to a lesser extent, on price. Our competitors in the installed system space include Vector Security, American Sentry Guard, GVI Security Solutions, Inc., ADT Security Services, Ltd. (a division of Tyco International) and Sonitrol, Inc. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors who are larger or better capitalized. 

&#160; 

The market for video conferencing products and services is extremely competitive. Competitive factors include pricing, our reputation and ease of use. Our primary competitors include manufacturers and resellers of video communications equipment, some are larger, have longer operating histories and have greater financial resources and industry recognition than us. The competitors would include local Bell Companies, Polycom and Tandberg. 

&#160; 

Since the barriers to entry in the market are relatively low and the potential market is large, we expect continued growth in existing competitors and the entrance of new competitors in the future. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly longer operating histories and significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources, as well as greater name recognition, than we do. As a result, these companies may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their competing products and services. There are no assurances we will ever effectively compete in our target markets. 

&#160;
