Our Business 

&#160;

AuctionInc Software. AuctionInc is a suite of online shipping and tax management tools assisting businesses with e-commerce storefronts, shipping solutions, tax calculation, inventory management, and auction processing. The application was designed originally to reduce overhead costs for auction sales, but over time the functionality and core business is strictly focused on real-time carrier calculated shipping rates and tax calculations. The product does have tools to assist with other aspects of the fulfillment process, but the main purpose of the product is to provide accurate shipping and tax calculations and packaging algorithms that provide customers with the best possible shipping and tax solutions. 

The AuctionInc system was originally designed to assist and improve just the Company's sales, but management realized that there was a need for an order management system for individuals and businesses that sell on the Internet, specifically at auctions and sites with multiple sellers. In 2000 the Company's technology team focused its attention on the core fundamental piece of the system called the Shipping Calculator. The Company recognized the potential importance of the calculator and filed for a patent before launching it to the public in April 2002. The Company obtained its first patent on the shipping calculator in January 2008, the second patent in April 2011, the third patent in January 2013, the fourth patent in August 2013 and a fifth patent in January 2014. One additional patent is pending. The product is modular based and we continue to develop new tools and products for its customers. 

&#160; 

BeerRun Software. BeerRun Software is a brewery management and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau tax reporting software. Small craft brewers can utilize the product to manage brewery schedules, inventory, packaging, sales and purchasing. Tax reporting can be processed with a single click and is fully customizable by state or providence. The software is designed to integrate with QuickBooks accounting platforms by using our powerful sync engine. We currently offer two versions of the software BeerRun and BeerRun Light which excludes some of the enhanced features of BeerRun without disrupting the core functionality of the software. Additional features include Brewpad and Kegmaster and can be added on to the base product. Craft brewing is on the rise in the United States and we feel that there is a large potential to grow this portion of our business. 

&#160;

SpiritRun is a product of BeerRun and is designed specifically for distilleries. This product was recently released and we feel that there with additional marketing and visibility in the distillery industry. SpiritRun has the right core resources to be a valuable tool in distilleries around the United States. 

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our mission is to grow our product lines and services related to our shipping and tax calculators as well as our brewery management products. 

Our strategy during 2015 was to develop our shipping calculator line of products by providing accurate real-time shipping rates for multiple shopping cart platforms available on the internet. These products are built on our web service API (Application Process Interface) and are available as a stand-alone product for single sellers or integrators. Our development of new integrations with third party shopping carts such as X-Cart5, Ready, WP eCommerce and JigoShop have contributed significantly to the growth of AuctionInc in 2015. Additionally we feel that there are a large number of cart platforms offered via the Word Press channel that are in need of our shipping calculator technologies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our business plan takes into consideration the growth of online shopping cart platforms available on the internet and the weakness of their native functionality with regard to the shipping calculators. AuctionInc&#8217;s complex packaging algorithms and ability to calculate comparative rates is a beneficial partner to any one of the new and legacy carts available. Identification and development of the fastest growing cart platforms has been and will continue to be our primary focus for integrations in 2015 and beyond. 

With the number of small craft breweries in excess of 4,000 in the United States we recognize there needs to be a product that allows brewers to manage their operations and integrate the results into QuickBooks. BeerRun Light was launched in November 2015 to further assist smaller and start-up breweries with the management of their operations. The new product provides all of the core functionality without many of the advanced features of the parent product. The success of BeerRun Light continues to grow and is becoming a significant part of the BeerRun line of products. 

The business strategy described above is intended to enhance our opportunities in the online e-commerce market. However, there are a number of factors that may impact our plans and inhibit our success. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; included in Item 1A. Therefore, we have no guarantees and can provide no assurances, that our plans will be successful. 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

Successful branding of our corporate identity and services is the key to our success. We changed our name to PAID, Inc. at the end of 2003 and continue to use AuctionInc.com as its primary identifier. BeerRun as a brand was in existence prior to our purchase and we have continued to market and recognize the value of the product. 

The Company will continue to market AuctionInc and BeerRun throughout 2016 and beyond. Based on experience with existing partnerships that promote AuctionInc, the Company believes that creating partnerships is an effective marketing tool to promote and encourage new registrations. The new products offered by AuctionInc are most easily viewed in the Word Press repository. As we grow the product line the visibility of our offerings increases and our download rates and success of conversions increases. The Company will continue to seek new partnerships to help grow this line of products. The Company may promote the AuctionInc and BeerRun product lines in trade publications to reach small and midsize companies. Representatives of the Company will attend trade shows, events and conferences to promote BeerRun Software and expand the Company's marketing base. 

Although we believe that this marketing strategy, if successful, will lead to increased revenues, and attract more users to our site, we have no commitments that our marketing will be successful or our sales will increase. There are a number of factors that may impact our plans and inhibit our success. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; included in Item 1A. Therefore, we have no guarantees and can provide no assurances that our plans will be successful. 

Revenue Sources 

&#160;

In 2015, our revenues were primarily derived from our shipping calculator services and brewery management software services. We expect that the revenues from these services will continue to grow as we focus on AuctionInc and BeerRun. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; included in Item 1A. We have no guarantees and can provide no assurances, that our plans will be successful. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Our line of AuctionInc shipping calculator software is proprietary. We received five patents related to our online auction shipping and tax calculators which were respectively issued in January 2008, April 2011, January 2013, August 2013 and January 2014 and we have one additional pending patent. On September 16, 2015, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board entered a final ruling that all of these patents (with the exception of the patent that was issued in January 2008) lacked patent eligible subject matter and therefore, the claims of these patents were not valid. The PTAB&#8217;s final ruling does not affect the validity of our patent which was issued in January 2008 or our pending patent application. We do not have any other patents for our designs or innovations and we may not be able to obtain copyright, patent or other protection for our proprietary technologies or for the processes developed by our employees. Legal standards relating to intellectual property rights in computer software are still developing and this area of the law is evolving with new technologies. Our intellectual property rights do not guarantee any competitive advantage and may not sufficiently protect us against competitors with similar technology. We believe that our products and other proprietary rights do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. However, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current or future products or other works of ours. This assertion may require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We also utilize free open-source technology in certain areas. Unlike proprietary software, open-source software has publicly available source code and can be copied, modified and distributed with minimal restrictions. We use open source software and technology as well to support the growing social and viral opportunities on the Internet. By using 'best-of-breed' products and tools we can maximize our clients&#8217; opportunities while minimizing our costs, which we are able to pass on to our customers. 

&#160;

As with any software product BeerRun is not excluded from the competitive market. There are three or four competitors in the industry all with a unique perspective. The launch of our new offering has helped us maintain a presence in the brewery management industry. Our sales team stays informed with the competition and we have the ability to modify our product as the industry changes. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Over the past year the Company has made significant progress developing new integrations with e-commerce shopping cart platforms. The Company now employs several developers who are focused on the growth of AuctionInc and its technologies. 

&#160;

We currently have a development team enhancing and maintaining the BeerRun platform and we also maintain a relationship with the original designer who we will continue to engage in opportunities that grow the product per the Company&#8217;s strategy. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 30, 2016, the Company currently has two part time and four full time equivalent employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements and consider the relationship with our employees to be good. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are not currently subject to direct federal, state or local regulation, and laws or regulations applicable to access or commerce on the Internet, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally. However, due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security.
