 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Toll Brothers, Inc., a corporation incorporated in Delaware in May 1986, began doing business through predecessor entities in 1967. When this report uses the words &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and the &#8220;Company,&#8221; they refer to Toll Brothers, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References herein to fiscal year refer to our fiscal years ended or ending October 31. 

General 

We design, build, market, sell, and arrange financing for detached and attached homes in luxury residential communities. We cater to move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, age-qualified, and second-home buyers in the United States (&#8220;Traditional Home Building Product&#8221;). We also design, build, market, and sell homes in urban infill markets through Toll Brothers City Living &#174; &#32;(&#8220;City Living&#8221;). At October 31, 2016 , we were operating in 19 &#32;states. In November 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Coleman Real Estate Holdings, LLC, a home builder operating in Boise, Idaho. (See Acquisitions - Coleman Real Estate Holdings, LLC below for more information.) 

In the five years ended October 31, 2016 , we delivered 24,490 &#32;homes from 621 communities, including 6,098 &#32;homes from 377 communities in fiscal 2016 . At October 31, 2016 , we had 543 &#32;communities containing approximately 48,837 &#32;home sites that we owned or controlled through options. 

Backlog consists of homes under contract but not yet delivered to our home buyers (&#8220;backlog&#8221;). We had a backlog of $3.98 billion &#32;( 4,685 &#32;homes) at October 31, 2016 ; we expect to deliver approximately 97% &#32;of these homes in fiscal 2017. 

We operate our own land development, architectural, engineering, mortgage, title, landscaping, security monitoring, lumber distribution, house component assembly, and manufacturing operations. We also develop, own, and operate golf courses and country clubs, which generally are associated with several of our master planned communities. 

We are developing several land parcels for master planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. Two of these master planned communities are being developed 100% by us, and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners. 

In addition to our residential for-sale business, we also develop and operate for-rent apartments through joint ventures. These projects, which are located in the metro Boston to metro Washington, D.C. corridor; Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; and Fremont, California are being operated, are being developed, or will be developed with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living, Toll Brothers Campus Living, and Toll Brothers Realty Trust. At October 31, 2016 , we controlled 28 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 9,600 &#32;units. 

Through several joint ventures, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gibraltar Capital and Asset Management, LLC (&#8220;Gibraltar&#8221;), provides builders and developers with land banking and venture capital, owns certain foreclosed real estate and distressed loans and is a participant in an entity that owns and controls a portfolio of loans and real estate. 

See &#8220;Investments in Unconsolidated Entities&#8221; below for more information relating to these joint ventures. 

Business Trends and Outlook 

Since the third quarter of fiscal 2014 through the end of fiscal 2016, we saw a general strengthening in customer demand. In fiscal 2016 , we signed 6,719 &#32;contracts with an aggregate value of $ 5.65 billion , compared to 5,910 &#32;contracts with an aggregate value of $4.96 billion &#32;in fiscal 2015 , and 5,271 contracts with an aggregate value of $3.90 billion in fiscal 2014. We believe that, as the national economy continues to improve and as the millennial generation comes of age, pent-up demand for homes will continue to be released. 

For information and analysis of recent trends in our operations and financial condition, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#8220;Form 10-K&#8221;), and for financial information about our results of operations, assets, liabilities, stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows, see the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K. 

At October 31, 2016 , we had 543 &#32;communities containing approximately 48,837 &#32;home sites that we owned or controlled through options; we owned approximately 34,137 &#32;of these home sites and controlled approximately 14,700 &#32;additional home sites through options. Of the 48,837 &#32;home sites, approximately 17,065 &#32;were substantially improved. Of the 543 &#32;communities, 313 &#32;were residential communities under development (&#8220;operating communities&#8221;) containing 24,816 &#32;home sites and 230 &#32;were future communities containing 24,021 &#32;home sites. In addition, at October 31, 2016 , our Land Development Joint Ventures and Homebuilding Joint Ventures owned approximately 11,400 &#32;and approximately 400 &#32;home sites, respectively. 

At October 31, 2016 , we were offering homes for sale in 305 &#32;communities at base prices for our Traditional Home Building Product, generally ranging from approximately $225,000 to $1,965,000, and we were offering homes for sale in five &#32;communities at base prices, for our City Living Product, generally ranging from $420,000 to $6,580,000. In a few of our communities being developed, we are offering homes at prices substantially higher than those indicated. During fiscal 2016 , we delivered 6,098 &#32;homes at an average base price of approximately $721,000. On average, our home buyers added approximately 21.5%, or $155,000 per home in customized options and lot premiums to the base price of the homes we delivered in fiscal 2016 , as compared to 20.7% or $134,000 per home in fiscal 2015 &#32;and 19.9% or $124,000 per home in fiscal 2014 . 

We had a backlog of $3.98 billion &#32;( 4,685 &#32;homes) at October 31, 2016 ; $3.50 billion &#32;( 4,064 &#32;homes) at October 31, 2015 ; and $2.72 billion &#32;( 3,679 &#32;homes) at October 31, 2014 . Of the 4,685 &#32;homes in backlog at October 31, 2016 , approximately 97% are expected to be delivered by October 31, 2017 . 

Our business is subject to many risks, including risks associated with obtaining the necessary approvals on a property and completing the land improvements on it. We attempt, where possible, to reduce certain risks by controlling land for future development through options (also referred to herein as &#8220;land purchase contracts&#8221; or &#8220;option and purchase agreements&#8221;); however, in recent years, we have had more success in negotiating land parcels for immediate purchase since many sellers were not in a position to wait, or unwilling to take the financial risk of not completing the sale. These options enable us to obtain the necessary governmental approvals before we acquire title to the land. We also reduce certain risks by generally commencing construction of a detached home only after executing an agreement of sale and receiving a substantial down payment from the buyer and by using subcontractors to perform home construction and land development work on a fixed-price basis. 

Acquisitions 

Shapell Industries, Inc. 

On February 4, 2014 , we completed our acquisition of Shapell Industries, Inc. (&#8220;Shapell&#8221;) pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) dated November 6, 2013 with Shapell Investment Properties, Inc. (&#8220;SIPI&#8221;). We acquired all of the equity interests in Shapell from SIPI on February 4, 2014 for $1.49 billion , net of cash acquired (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). We acquired the single-family residential real property development business of Shapell, including a portfolio of approximately 4,950 &#32;home sites in California, some of which we have sold to other builders. The Acquisition provided us with a premier California land portfolio including 11 &#32;active selling communities, as of the Acquisition date, in affluent, high-growth markets: the San Francisco Bay area, metro Los Angeles, Orange County, and the Carlsbad market. As part of the Acquisition, we assumed contracts to deliver 126 &#32;homes with an aggregate value of approximately $105.3 million . The Shapell operations have been fully integrated into our operations. 

Coleman Real Estate Holdings, LLC 

In October 2016, we entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of Coleman Real Estate Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Coleman&#8221;). In November 2016, we completed the acquisition of Coleman for approximately $85.2 million &#32;in cash. The assets acquired were primarily inventory, including approximately 1,750 &#32;home sites owned or controlled through land purchase agreements. As part of the acquisition, we assumed contracts to deliver 128 &#32;homes with an aggregate value of $38.8 million . The average price of the undelivered homes at the date of acquisition was approximately $303,000 . As a result of this acquisition, our selling community count increased by 15 &#32;communities at the acquisition date. 

See Note 2, &#8220;Acquisitions,&#8221; in Item 15(a)1 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these acquisitions. 

Our Communities and Homes 

Our traditional home building communities are generally located in affluent suburban areas near major highways providing access to major cities and are generally located on land we have either acquired and developed or acquired fully approved and, in some cases, improved. We also currently operate in the affluent urban markets of Hoboken and Jersey City, New Jersey; New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the suburbs of Washington, D.C. 

At October 31, 2016 , we were operating in the following major suburban and urban residential markets: 

&#8226; 

Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area 

&#8226; 

Fairfield, Hartford, and New Haven Counties, Connecticut 

&#8226; 

Westchester and Dutchess county, New York 

&#8226; 

Boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York City 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area 

&#8226; 

Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania 

&#8226; 

Virginia and Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C. 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area 

We develop individual stand-alone communities as well as multi-product, master planned communities. Our master planned communities, many of which include golf courses and other country club-type amenities, enable us to offer multiple home types and sizes to a broad range of move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, and second-home buyers. We seek to realize efficiencies from shared common costs, such as land development and infrastructure, over the several communities within the master planned community. 

Each of our detached home communities offers several home plans with the opportunity for home buyers to select various exterior styles. We design each community to fit existing land characteristics. We strive to achieve diversity among architectural styles within a community by offering a variety of house models and several exterior design options for each model, preserving existing trees and foliage whenever practicable, and curving street layouts to allow relatively few homes to be seen from any vantage point. Our communities have attractive entrances with distinctive signage and landscaping. We believe that our added attention to community detail gives each community a diversified neighborhood appearance that enhances home values. 

Our traditional attached home communities generally offer one- to four-story homes, provide for limited exterior options, and often include commonly owned recreational facilities, such as clubhouses, playing fields, swimming pools, and tennis courts. 

We offer some of the same basic home designs in similar communities; however, we are continuously developing new designs to replace or augment existing ones to ensure that our homes reflect current consumer tastes. We use our own architectural staff and also engage unaffiliated architectural firms to develop new designs. During the past fiscal year, we introduced 212 new models for our Traditional Home Building Product (173 detached models and 39 attached models). 

In our Traditional Home Building Product communities, a wide selection of options are available to home buyers for additional charges. The number and complexity of options in our Traditional Home Building Product typically increase with the size and base selling price of our homes. Major options include additional garages, extra fireplaces, guest suites, finished lofts, and other additional rooms. 

We market our high quality homes to upscale luxury home buyers, generally comprised of those persons who have previously owned a principal residence and who are seeking to buy a larger or more desirable home &#8212; the so-called &#8220;move-up&#8221; market. We believe our reputation as a builder of homes for this market enhances our competitive position with respect to the sale of our smaller, more moderately priced homes. 

We continue to pursue growth initiatives to expand our brand by broadening our residential product lines across the demographic spectrum. In addition to our traditional &#8220;move-up&#8221; home buyer, we are focusing on the 50+ year-old &#8220;empty-nester&#8221; market, as well as the millennial generation. 

We market to the 50+ year-old &#8220;empty-nester&#8221; market, which we believe has strong growth potential. We have developed a number of home designs with features such as one-story living and first-floor master bedroom suites, as well as communities with recreational amenities, such as golf courses, marinas, pool complexes, country clubs, and recreation centers that we believe appeal to this category of home buyers. We have integrated certain of these designs and features in some of our other home types and communities. We also develop active-adult, &#8220;age-qualified&#8221; communities for households in which at least one member must be 55+ years of age. As of October 31, 2016 , we were selling from 53 active-adult/age-qualified communities and expect to open additional active-adult/age-qualified communities during the next few years. Of the value and number of net contracts signed in fiscal 2016 , approximately 14% and 20%, respectively, were in active-adult/age-qualified communities; in fiscal 2015 , approximately 11% and 16%, respectively, were in such communities; and in fiscal 2014 , approximately 12% and 16%, respectively were in active-adult/age-qualified communities. 

With the millennial generation now entering their thirties and forming families, we are starting to benefit from their desire for home ownership from the affluent leading edge of this demographic group. We are currently focusing on this group with our core suburban homes, urban condominiums and luxury rental apartment products. 

We have developed and are developing, on our own or through joint ventures with third parties, a number of high-density, high-, mid- and low-rise urban luxury communities to serve a growing market of affluent move-up families, empty-nesters, and young professionals seeking to live in or close to major cities. These communities are currently marketed under our City Living brand. These communities, which we are currently developing or planning to develop on our own or through joint ventures, are located in Bethesda, Maryland; Hoboken and Jersey City, New Jersey; the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

A great majority of our City Living communities are high-rise projects and take an extended period of time to construct. We generally start selling homes in these communities after construction has commenced and by the time construction has been completed we typically have a significant number of homes in backlog. Once construction has been completed, the homes in backlog in these communities are generally delivered very quickly. 

We believe that the demographics of the move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, age-qualified, and second-home upscale markets will provide us with an opportunity for growth in the future, and that our financial strength and portfolio of approved home sites in the Washington, D.C. to Boston corridor and in our California markets, in which land is scarce and approvals are more difficult to obtain, give us a competitive advantage. We continue to believe that many of our communities are in desirable locations that are difficult to replace and that many of these communities have substantial embedded value that may be realized in the future as the housing recovery strengthens. 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau (&#8220;Census Bureau&#8221;), the number of households earning $100,000 or more (in constant 2015 dollars) at September 2016 stood at 33.2 million, or approximately 26.4% of all U.S. households. This group has grown at three times the rate of increase of all U.S. households since 1980. According to Harvard University&#8217;s 2016 report, &#8220;The State of the Nation&#8217;s Housing,&#8221; demographic forces are likely to drive the addition of approximately 1.3 million new households per year during the next decade. 

Housing starts, which encompass the units needed for household formations, second homes, and the replacement of obsolete or demolished units, have not kept pace with this projected household growth. According to the Census Bureau&#8217;s October 2016 New Residential Sales Report, new home inventory stands at a supply of just 5.2 months, based on current sales paces. If demand and pace increase significantly, the supply of 5.2 months could quickly be drawn down. During the period 1970 through 2007, total housing starts in the United States averaged approximately 1.6 million per year, while during the period 2008 through 2015, total housing starts averaged approximately 0.81 million per year according to the Census Bureau. 

At October 31, 2016 , we were selling homes from 310 &#32;communities, compared to 288 communities at October 31, 2015 , and 263 communities at October 31, 2014 .

At October 31, 2016 , significant site improvements had not yet commenced on approximately 8,927 &#32;of the 20,131 &#32;available home sites. Of the 20,131 &#32;available home sites, 1,588 &#32;were not yet owned by us but were controlled through options. 

Of our 313 &#32;operating communities at October 31, 2016 , a total of 310 &#32;communities were offering homes for sale; and three &#32;communities had been temporarily shut down and are expected to reopen in fiscal 2016. Of the 310 &#32;communities in which homes were being offered for sale at October 31, 2016 , a total of 247 &#32;were detached home communities and 63 &#32;were attached home communities. 

At October 31, 2016 , we had 796 &#32;homes (exclusive of model homes) under construction or completed but not under contract in our traditional communities, of which 448 &#32;were in detached home communities and 348 &#32;were in attached home communities. In addition, we had 123 units that were temporarily being held as rental units. At October 31, 2016 , we had 182 &#32;homes (exclusive of model homes) under construction or completed but not under contract in five City Living communities that were wholly owned. 

As a result of our wide product and geographic diversity, we have a wide range of base sales prices. The general range of base sales prices for our different lines of homes at October 31, 2016 , was as follows:

In general, our attached homes and City Living products do not offer significant structural options to our home buyer and thus they have a smaller option value as a percentage of base selling price. 

For more information regarding revenues, net contracts signed, income (loss) before income taxes, and assets by segment, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Segments&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Land Policy 

Before entering into an agreement to purchase a land parcel, we complete extensive comparative studies and analysis that assist us in evaluating the acquisition. Historically, we have attempted to enter into option agreements to purchase land for future communities; however, in recent years, we have had more success in negotiating land parcels for immediate purchase since many sellers were not in a position to wait, or unwilling to take the financial risk of not completing the sale. We have also entered into several joint ventures with other builders or developers to develop land for the use of the joint venture participants or for sale to outside parties. In addition, we have, at times, acquired the underlying mortgage on a property and subsequently obtained title to that property. 

Where possible, we enter into agreements to purchase land, referred to in this Form 10-K as &#8220;land purchase contracts,&#8221; &#8220;purchase agreements,&#8221; &#8220;options,&#8221; or &#8220;option agreements,&#8221; on a non-recourse basis, thereby limiting our financial exposure to the amounts expended in obtaining any necessary governmental approvals, the costs incurred in the planning and design of the community, and, in some cases, some or all of our deposit. The use of these agreements may increase the price of land that we eventually acquire, but reduces our risk by allowing us to obtain the necessary development approvals before acquiring the land or allowing us to delay the acquisition to a later date. Historically, as approvals were obtained, the value of the purchase agreements and land generally increased; however, in any given time period, this may not happen. We have the ability to extend some of these purchase agreements for varying periods of time, in some cases by making an additional payment and, in other cases, without making any additional payment. Our purchase agreements are typically subject to numerous conditions, including, but not limited to, the ability to obtain necessary governmental approvals for the proposed community. Our deposit under an agreement may be returned to us if all approvals are not obtained, although predevelopment costs usually will not be recoverable. We generally have the right to cancel any of our agreements to purchase land by forfeiture of some or all of the deposits we have made pursuant to the agreement. 

During fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 , we acquired control of approximately 10,682 &#32;home sites (net of options terminated and home sites sold) and approximately 2,611 &#32;home sites (net of options terminated), respectively. At October 31, 2016 , we controlled approximately 48,837 &#32;home sites, as compared to approximately 44,253 &#32;home sites at October 31, 2015 , and 47,167 &#32;home sites at October 31, 2014 . 

We are developing several parcels of land for master planned communities in which we intend to build homes on a portion of the lots and sell the remaining lots to other builders. Two of these master planned communities are being developed 100% by us, and the remaining communities are being developed through joint ventures with other builders or financial partners. At October 31, 2016 , our Land Development Joint Ventures owned approximately 11,400 &#32;home sites, and our Homebuilding Joint Ventures owned approximately 400 &#32;home sites. At October 31, 2016 , we had agreed to acquire 240 &#32;home sites from two &#32;of our Land Development Joint Ventures and we expect to purchase approximately 3,600 &#32;additional home sites over a number of years from several other joint ventures in which we have interests. 

Our ability to continue development activities over the long term will be dependent upon, among other things, a suitable economic environment and our continued ability to locate and enter into options or agreements to purchase land, obtain 

governmental approvals for suitable parcels of land, and consummate the acquisition and complete the development of such land. 

The following is a summary of home sites for future communities that we either owned or controlled through options or purchase agreements at October 31, 2016 , as distinguished from our operating communities :

Of the 24,021 &#32;planned home sites at October 31, 2016 , we owned 10,909 &#32;and controlled 13,112 &#32;through options and purchase agreements. Approximately 1,200 of these home sites were substantially improved. 

At October 31, 2016 , the aggregate purchase price of land parcels subject to option and purchase agreements in operating communities and future communities was approximately $1.62 billion &#32;(including $79.2 million &#32;of land to be acquired from joint ventures in which we have invested and $85.2 million for the acquisition of Coleman inventory). Of the $1.62 billion &#32;of land purchase commitments, we paid or deposited $65.3 million , and, if we acquire all of these land parcels, we will be required to pay an additional $1.56 billion . The purchases of these land parcels are expected to occur over the next several years. We have additional land parcels under option that have been excluded from the aforementioned aggregate purchase price since we do not believe that we will complete the purchase of these land parcels and no additional funds will be required from us to terminate these contracts. These option contracts have either been written off or written down to the estimated amount that we expect to recover on them when the contracts are terminated. 

We have a substantial amount of land currently under control for which approvals have been obtained or are being sought. We devote significant resources to locating suitable land for future development and obtaining the required approvals on land under our control. There can be no assurance that the necessary development approvals will be secured for the land currently under our control or for land that we may acquire control of in the future or that, upon obtaining such development approvals, we will elect to complete the purchases of land under option or complete the development of land that we own. We generally have been successful in obtaining governmental approvals in the past. We believe that we have an adequate supply of land in our existing communities and proposed communities (assuming that all properties are developed) to maintain our operations at current levels for several years. 

Community Development 

We typically expend considerable effort in developing a concept for each community, which includes determining the size, style, and price range of the homes; the layout of the streets and individual home sites; and the overall community design. After the necessary governmental subdivision and other approvals have been obtained, which may take several years, we improve the land by clearing and grading it; installing roads, underground utility lines, and recreational amenities; distinctive entrance features; and staking out individual home sites. 

Each community is managed by a project manager. Working with sales staff, construction managers, marketing personnel, and, when required, other in-house and outside professionals such as accountants, engineers, and architects, a project manager is responsible for supervising and coordinating the various developmental steps such as land approval, land acquisition, marketing, selling, construction, and customer service, and monitoring the progress of work and controlling expenditures. Major decisions regarding each community are made in consultation with senior members of our management team. 

We act as a general contractor for most of our projects. Subcontractors perform all home construction and land development work, generally under fixed-price contracts. We purchase most of the materials we use in our home construction and in our land development activities directly from the manufacturers or producers. We generally have multiple sources for the materials we purchase, and we have not experienced significant delays due to unavailability of necessary materials. See &#8220;Manufacturing/Distribution Facilities&#8221; in Item 2 of this Form 10-K. 

Our construction managers coordinate subcontracting activities and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. One of the ways in which we seek to achieve home buyer satisfaction is by providing our construction managers with incentive compensation arrangements based upon each home buyer&#8217;s satisfaction, as expressed by the buyers&#8217; responses on pre- and post-closing questionnaires. 

The most significant variable affecting the timing of our revenue stream, other than housing demand, is the opening of the community for sale, which generally occurs shortly after receipt of final land regulatory approvals. Receipt of approvals permits us to begin the process of obtaining executed sales contracts from home buyers. Although our sales and construction activities vary somewhat by season, which can affect the timing of closings, any such seasonal effect is relatively insignificant compared to the effect of the timing of receipt of final regulatory approvals, the opening of the community, and the subsequent timing of closings. 

Marketing and Sales 

We believe that our marketing strategy for our Traditional Home Building Product, which emphasizes our more expensive &#8220;Estate&#8221; and &#8220;Executive&#8221; lines of homes, has enhanced our reputation as a builder and developer of high quality upscale homes. We believe this reputation results in greater demand for all of our lines of homes. We generally include attractive decorative features such as chair rails, crown moldings, dentil moldings, vaulted and coffered ceilings, and other aesthetic elements, even in our less expensive homes, based on our belief that this customization enhances our product and improves our marketing and sales effort. 

In determining the prices for our homes, we utilize, in addition to management&#8217;s extensive experience, an internally developed value analysis program that compares our homes with homes offered by other builders in each local marketing area. In our application of this program, we assign a positive or negative dollar value to differences between our product features and those of our competitors, such as house and community amenities, location, and reputation. 

We typically have a sales office in each community that is staffed by our own sales personnel. Sales personnel are generally compensated with both salary and commission. A significant portion of our sales is also derived from the introduction of customers to our communities by local cooperating real estate agents. 

We expend great effort and cost in designing and decorating our model homes, which play an important role in our marketing. In our models, we create an appealing atmosphere, which may include cookies baking in the oven, fires burning in fireplaces, and music playing in the background. Interior decorating varies among the models and is carefully selected to reflect the lifestyles of prospective buyers. 

The Internet is an important resource we use in marketing and providing information to our customers. Visitors to our website, www.TollBrothers.com, can obtain detailed information regarding our communities and homes across the country, take panoramic or video tours of our homes, and design their own home based upon our available floor plans and options . We also advertise in newspapers, in other local and regional publications, and on billboards. We also market our communities through the use of color brochures. 

We have a two-step sales process. The first step takes place when a potential home buyer visits one of our communities and decides to purchase one of our homes, at which point the home buyer signs a non-binding deposit agreement and provides a small, refundable deposit. This deposit will reserve, for a short period of time, the home site or unit that the home buyer has selected. This deposit also locks in the base price of the home. Because these deposit agreements are non-binding, they are not recorded as signed contracts, nor are they recorded in backlog. Deposit rates are tracked on a weekly basis to help us monitor the strength or weakness in demand in each of our communities. If demand for homes in a particular community is strong, senior management determines whether the base selling prices in that community should be increased. If demand for the homes in a particular community is weak, we determine whether or not sales incentives and/or discounts on home prices should be adjusted. 

The second step in the sales process occurs when we actually sign a binding agreement of sale with the home buyer and the home buyer gives us a cash down payment that is generally nonrefundable. Cash down payments currently average approximately 8% of the total purchase price of a home. Between the time that the home buyer signs the non-binding deposit agreement and the binding agreement of sale, he or she is required to complete a financial questionnaire that gives us the ability to evaluate whether the home buyer has the financial resources necessary to purchase the home. If we determine that the home buyer is not financially qualified, we will not enter into an agreement of sale with the home buyer. During fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , our customers signed net contracts for $5.65 billion &#32;( 6,719 &#32;homes), $4.96 billion &#32;( 5,910 &#32;homes), and $3.90 billion &#160;( 5,271 &#32;homes), respectively. When we report net contracts signed, the number and value of contracts signed are reported net of all cancellations occurring during the reporting period, whether signed in that reporting period or in a prior period. Only outstanding agreements of sale that have been signed by both the home buyer and us as of the end of the period for which we are reporting are included in backlog. 

Customer Mortgage Financing 

We maintain relationships with a widely diversified group of mortgage financial institutions, many of which are among the largest in the industry. We believe that regional and community banks continue to recognize the long-term value in creating relationships with affluent customers such as our home buyers, and these banks continue to provide such customers with financing. We believe that our home buyers generally are, and should continue to be, better able to secure mortgages due to their typically lower loan-to-value ratios and attractive &#32; credit profiles, as compared to the average home buyer. 

Our mortgage subsidiary provides mortgage financing for a portion of our home closings. Our mortgage subsidiary determines whether the home buyer qualifies for the mortgage he or she is seeking based upon information provided by the home buyer and other sources. For those home buyers who qualify, our mortgage subsidiary provides the home buyer with a mortgage commitment that specifies the terms and conditions of a proposed mortgage loan based upon then-current market conditions. 

Information about the number and amount of loans funded by our mortgage subsidiary is contained in the table below.

TBI Mortgage Company financed settlements exclude brokered and referred loans, which amounted to approximately 4.2%, 6.2%, 4.4%, 5.1%, and 6.2% of our home closings in fiscal 2016 , 2015 , 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively. 

Prior to the actual closing of the home and funding of the mortgage, the home buyer may lock in an interest rate based upon the terms of the commitment. At the time of rate lock, our mortgage subsidiary agrees to sell the proposed mortgage loan to one of several outside recognized mortgage financing institutions (&#8220;investors&#8221;) that are willing to honor the terms and conditions, including the interest rate, committed to the home buyer. We believe that these investors have adequate financial resources to honor their commitments to our mortgage subsidiary. At October 31, 2016 , our mortgage subsidiary was committed to fund $1.35 billion &#32;of mortgage loans. Of these commitments, $255.6 million , as well as $231.4 million &#32;of mortgage loans receivable, have &#8220;locked-in&#8221; interest rates. Our mortgage subsidiary funds its commitments through a combination of its own capital, capital provided from us, its loan facility, and the sale of mortgage loans to various investors. Our mortgage subsidiary has commitments from investors to acquire all $487.0 million &#32;of these locked-in loans and receivables. Our home buyers have not locked in the interest rate on the remaining $1.09 billion &#32;of mortgage loans. 

Competition 

The home building business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous home builders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do. Sales of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that has acquired a home through a foreclosure, also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service, and reputation. We believe our financial stability, relative to many others in our industry, is a favorable competitive factor as more home buyers focus on builder solvency. 

There are fewer and more selective lenders serving our industry as compared to prior years and we believe that these lenders gravitate to the home building companies that offer them the greatest security, the strongest balance sheets, and the broadest array of potential business opportunities. 

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 

We have investments in various unconsolidated entities. These entities include Land Development Joint Ventures, Home Building Joint Ventures, Rental Property Joint Ventures, and Gibraltar Joint Ventures. At October 31, 2016 , we had investments of $496.4 million &#32;in these unconsolidated entities and were committed to invest or advance up to an additional $273.8 million &#32;to these entities if they require additional funding. 

In fiscal 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , we recognized income from the unconsolidated entities in which we had an investment of $40.7 million , $21.1 million , and $41.1 million , respectively. In addition, we earned construction and management fee income from these unconsolidated entities of $10.3 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 , $11.3 million &#32;in fiscal 2015 , and $7.3 million &#32;in fiscal 2014 . 

Land Development Joint Ventures 

We have investments in a number of Land Development Joint Ventures to develop land. Some of these Land Development Joint Ventures develop land for the sole use of the venture participants, including us, and others develop land for sale to the joint venture participants and to unrelated builders. At October 31, 2016 , we had approximately $223.5 million &#32;invested in our Land Development Joint Ventures and funding commitments of $244.3 million &#32;to five &#32;of the Land Development Joint Ventures which will be funded if additional investments in the ventures are required. At October 31, 2016 , four &#32;of these joint ventures had aggregate loan commitments of $470.0 million &#32;and outstanding borrowings against these commitments of $393.7 million . At October 31, 2016 , our Land Development Joint Ventures owned approximately 11,400 &#32;home sites. 

At October 31, 2016 , we had agreed to acquire 240 &#32;home sites from two &#32;of our Land Development Joint Ventures for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $79.2 million . In addition, we expect to purchase approximately 3,600 &#32;additional home sites over a number of years from several joint ventures in which we have interests; the purchase prices of these home sites will be determined at a future date. 

Home Building Joint Ventures 

At October 31, 2016 , we had an aggregate of $98.8 million &#32;of investments in various Home Building Joint Ventures to develop approximately 400 &#32;luxury for-sale homes. At October 31, 2016 , we had $9.9 million &#32;of funding commitments to two &#32;of these joint ventures. In fiscal 2016 , the value of net contracts signed by our Home Building Joint Ventures was $169.8 million &#32;( 113 &#32;homes), and they delivered $164.9 million &#32;( 115 &#32;homes) of revenue. At October 31, 2016 , our Homebuilding Joint Ventures had a backlog of undelivered homes of $471.5 million &#32;( 184 &#32;homes). 

Rental Property Joint Ventures 

Over the past several years, we acquired control of a number of land parcels as for-rent apartment projects, including two student housing sites. At October 31, 2016 , we had an aggregate of $153.6 million &#32;of investments in various Rental Property Joint Ventures. At October 31, 2016 , we controlled 28 land parcels as for-rent apartment projects containing approximately 9,600 &#32;units. These projects, which are located in the metro Boston to metro Washington, D.C. corridor; Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; and Fremont, California are being operated, are being developed or will be developed with partners under the brand names Toll Brothers Apartment Living, Toll Brothers Campus Living and Toll Brothers Realty Trust. 

At October 31, 2016 , we had approximately 2,950 &#32;units in for-rent apartment projects that were occupied or ready for occupancy, 600 &#32;units in the lease-up stage, 900 &#32;units under active development, and 5,150 &#32;units in the planning stage. Of the 9,600 &#32;units at October 31, 2016 , 4,850 &#32;were owned by joint ventures in which we have an interest; approximately 1,600 &#32;were owned by us, as we look for joint venture partners; 2,850 &#32;were under contract to be purchased by us; and 300 &#32;were under a letter of intent. 

Gibraltar Joint Ventures 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2016 , we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Gibraltar Capital and Asset Management, LLC (&#8220;Gibraltar&#8221;), entered into two &#32;ventures with an institutional investor to provide builders and developers with land banking and venture capital. We have a 25% &#32;interest in these ventures. These ventures will finance builders&#8217; and developers&#8217; acquisition and development of land and home sites and pursue other complementary investment strategies. We may invest up to $100.0 million &#32;in these ventures. As of October 31, 2016 , we had an investment of $8.8 million &#32;in these ventures. 

In addition, in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 , we entered into a separate venture with the same institutional investor to purchase, from Gibraltar, certain foreclosed real estate owned and distressed loans for $24.1 million . We have a 24% &#32;interest in this venture. In fiscal 2016 , we recognized a gain of $1.3 million &#32;from the sale of these assets to the venture. At October 31, 2016 , we have a $5.7 million &#32;investment in this venture and are committed to invest an additional $10.0 million , if necessary. 

Regulation and Environmental Matters 

We are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction, and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation authorizing the acquisition of land as dedicated open space, mainly by governmental, quasi-public, and nonprofit entities. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration, and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement, and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws and requirements has been to increase our overall costs, and they may have delayed, 

and in the future may delay, the opening of communities, or may have caused, and in the future may cause, us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals were obtained. See &#8220;Land Policy&#8221; in this Item 1. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums often relate to insufficient water or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity. 

In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market rental or sales prices. The impact of these requirements on us depends on how the various state and local governments in the areas in which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs for affordable housing. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us. 

We also are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (&#8220;environmental laws&#8221;). The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. 

Before consummating an acquisition, we generally engage independent environmental consultants to evaluate land for the potential of hazardous or toxic materials, wastes, or substances. Because we generally have obtained such assessments for the land we have purchased, we have not been significantly affected to date by the presence of such materials on our land. 

Our mortgage subsidiary is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules, and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations, and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules, and regulations can be to increase our home buyers&#8217; cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, and restrict our home buyers&#8217; access to some types of loans. 

Insurance/Warranty 

All of our homes are sold under our limited warranty as to workmanship and mechanical equipment. Many homes also come with a limited multi-year warranty as to structural integrity. 

We maintain insurance, subject to deductibles and self-insured amounts, to protect us against various risks associated with our activities, including, among others, general liability, &#8220;all-risk&#8221; property, construction defects, workers&#8217; compensation, automobile, and employee fidelity. We accrue for our expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts. 

Employees 

At October 31, 2016 , we employed approximately 4,200 persons full-time. At October 31, 2016 , we were subject to one collective bargaining agreement that covered less than 2% of our employees. We believe our employee relations are good.
