 ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL 

We are a publicly traded investment management firm whose primary business activity is managing, servicing and marketing 16 open-end mutual funds branded as the Hennessy Funds. We are committed to employing a consistent and repeatable investment process for the Hennessy Funds, combining time-tested stock selection strategies with a highly disciplined, team-managed approach, and to providing superior service to investors. Our goal is to provide products that investors can have confidence in, knowing their money is invested as promised, with their best interest in mind. Our firm was founded on these principles over 27 years ago and the same principles guide us today. 

We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds. We also provide shareholder services to the Hennessy Funds, but we have only earned shareholder service fees from all of (versus only some of) the Hennessy Funds since March 1, 2015. Investment advisory services include managing the composition of each fund&#146;s portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the fund&#146;s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), conducting investment research, monitoring compliance with each fund&#146;s investment restrictions and applicable laws and regulations, overseeing the selection and continued employment of sub-advisors and monitoring such sub-advisors&#146; investment performance and adherence to investment policies and compliance procedures, overseeing other service providers, maintaining public relations and marketing programs for each of the funds, preparing and distributing regulatory reports, and overseeing distribution through third party financial intermediaries. Shareholder services include maintaining an &#147;800&#148; number that the current investors of the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about the funds or their accounts, or to get help with processing exchange and redemption requests or changing account options. The fees we receive for investment advisory and shareholder services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. Accordingly, our revenues increase or decrease as our average assets under management rise or fall. The percentage amount of the investment advisory fees vary from fund to fund, but the percentage amount of the shareholder service fees is consistent across all of the funds. 

For six of the Hennessy Funds acquired through asset purchases, we have delegated the day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors. In exchange for these sub-advisory services, we pay each sub-advisor a fee out of our own assets, which is calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub-advised funds. Accordingly, the sub-advisor fees we pay increase or decrease as our average assets under management in our sub-advised funds increase or decrease, respectively. 

Our average assets under management for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, were $6.3 billion. As of the end of our fiscal year, our total assets under management were $6.7 billion, an increase of almost 1,700% from $375 million as of the end of our first fiscal year as a public company, which was September 30, 2002. 

Our business strategy centers on (i) organic growth through our marketing and sales efforts and (ii) growth through strategic purchases of management-related assets.

Domestic Equity Funds 

Seven of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Domestic Equity products. Of those seven funds, five utilize a quantitative investment strategy and two are actively managed, but they all employ a highly disciplined, team-managed approach to investing. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Domestic Equity product category: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund (investor class symbol HFCGX and institutional class symbol HICGX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in growth-oriented common stocks using a highly-disciplined, quantitative formula. While a majority of the companies generally selected by the Cornerstone Growth formula are small capitalization companies, the Cornerstone Growth formula may also select mid- and large-cap companies. This fund screens for stocks with a market capitalization of more than $175 million, a price-to-sales ratio of less than 1.5, higher annual earnings than in the previous year and stock price appreciation, or positive relative strength, over the prior three- and six-month periods. The fund then invests in the 50 common stocks with the highest one-year price appreciation. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Focus Fund (investor class symbol HFCSX and institutional class symbol HFCIX). The Hennessy Focus Fund seeks capital appreciation by employing a fundamental, bottom-up investment approach that concentrates the fund&#146;s holdings in companies most attractive to its portfolio managers. The Fund seeks high quality, growth-oriented companies with demonstrated strong competitive positions, predictable cash earnings growth, high return on invested capital, excellent management, and modest valuation. It maintains a concentrated portfolio of 20 to 30 stocks that are conviction-weighted with 60-80% of the fund&#146;s assets invested in the fund&#146;s top 10 holdings. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund (investor class symbol HFMDX and institutional class symbol HIMDX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Mid Cap 30 Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in mid-cap, growth-oriented companies using a highly disciplined, quantitative formula. This fund screens for stocks with a market capitalization of between $1 to $10 billion, excluding American Depository Receipts (&#147;ADRs&#148;), a price-to-sales ratio of less than 1.5, higher annual earnings than in the previous year and positive stock price appreciation, or positive relative strength, over the three-and six-month periods. The fund then invests in the 30 common stocks with the highest one-year price appreciation. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund (investor class symbol HFLGX and institutional class symbol HILGX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Large Growth Fund seeks long-term growth of capital by investing in growth-oriented common stocks of larger companies using a highly disciplined, quantitative formula. This fund screens for stocks with a market capitalization exceeding the average of the relevant database, excluding ADRs, a price-to-cash flow ratio less than the median of the relevant database, and positive total capital. The fund then invests in the 50 common stocks with the highest one-year return on total capital. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund (investor class symbol HFCVX and institutional class symbol HICVX). The Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing in larger, dividend-paying companies using a highly disciplined, quantitative formula. This fund screens for stocks with a market capitalization that exceeds the average of the relevant database, shares outstanding that exceeds the average of the relevant database, cash flow that exceeds the average of the relevant database, and 12-month sales that are 50% greater than the average of the relevant database. The fund then invests in the 50 common stocks with the highest dividend yield, which is calculated as the annual dividends paid by a company divided by the per share price of its stock. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Large Value Fund (investor class symbol HLVFX and institutional class symbol HLVIX). The Hennessy Large Value Fund seeks long-term growth of capital and current income by investing in common stock that are considered to be undervalued. Specifically, the fund invests in stocks that its portfolio managers consider to be undervalued based on earnings, dividends or assets or other widely recognized stock valuation measurements and that also have sound businesses with good future potential based on their fundamental characteristics. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Total Return Fund (investor class symbol HDOGX). The Hennessy Total Return Fund seeks total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, by investing approximately 50% of its assets in the 10 highest dividend-yielding common stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (commonly referred to as the &#147;Dogs of the Dow&#148;) and the remaining 50% in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. The fund then utilizes a borrowing strategy that allows the fund&#146;s performance to approximate what it would be if the fund had an asset allocation of roughly 75% Dogs of the Dow stocks and 25% U.S. Treasury securities. &#160;

Balanced and Fixed Income Funds 

Three of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Balanced and Fixed Income products. Of those three funds, one utilizes a quantitative investment strategy and two are actively managed. These funds follow a more conservative investment strategy focused on generating income and providing an alternative to mutual funds containing only equity stocks. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Balanced and Fixed Income product category: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Equity and Income Fund (investor class symbol HEIFX and institutional class symbol HEIIX). The Hennessy Equity and Income Fund seeks long-term capital growth and current income by investing in stocks, bonds and other fixed income securities designed to provide a balanced portfolio, with broad market exposure and low volatility. Under normal circumstances, the fund invests approximately 60% of its assets in equities, focusing on high-quality, dividend-paying stocks, and approximately 40% of its assets in high-quality, domestic corporate, agency and government bonds. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Balanced Fund (investor class symbol HBFBX). The Hennessy Balanced Fund seeks a combination of capital appreciation and current income by investing approximately 50% of its assets in the Dogs of the Dow stocks and approximately 50% of its assets in U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of less than one year. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Core Bond Fund (investor class symbol HCBFX and institutional class symbol HCBIX). The Hennessy Core Bond Fund seeks current income with capital growth as a secondary objective by investing in fixed income securities. The fund employs a core bond philosophy focusing on higher quality, intermediate term fixed income securities and is invested primarily in domestic investment grade corporate, agency and governmental bonds. Sector and Specialty Funds 

Six of the Hennessy Funds are categorized as Sector and Specialty products. Of those six funds, one is designed as an index fund and the other five are actively managed, but they all focus on a niche sector of the stock market. Following is a brief description of the investment objectives and principal investment strategies of the Hennessy Funds in the Sector and Specialty product category: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Gas Utility Fund (investor class symbol GASFX). The Hennessy Gas Utility Fund seeks income and capital appreciation by investing in the companies that deliver natural gas and are members of the American Gas Association (&#147;AGA&#148;). The fund owns all of the publicly-traded companies that comprise the AGA Stock Index, which is market cap weighted and adjusted for the percentage of natural gas assets on each company&#146;s balance sheet. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund (investor class symbol HSFNX and institutional class symbol HISFX). The Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund seeks capital appreciation by investing in small-cap companies principally engaged in the business of providing financial services. This fund invests in financial services companies with market capitalizations under $3 billion that the portfolio managers believe demonstrate a high quality management team with a long-term view, a well-balanced and uncomplicated business model, a conservative lending culture with high quality liabilities, sustainable earnings growth opportunities, a low-cost operating structure, and attractive valuations relative to the industry. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund (investor class symbol HLFNX and institutional class symbol HILFX). The Hennessy Large Cap Financial Fund seeks capital appreciation by investing in large capitalization companies principally engaged in the business of providing financial services. This fund invests in financial services companies with market capitalizations over $3 billion that the portfolio managers believe demonstrate a high quality management team with a long-term view, a well-balanced and uncomplicated business model, a conservative lending culture with high quality liabilities, sustainable earnings growth opportunities, a low-cost operating structure, and attractive valuations relative to the industry. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Technology Fund (investor class symbol HTECX and institutional class symbol HTCIX). The Hennessy Technology Fund seeks capital appreciation by investing in companies principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacturing or distribution of products or services in the technology industry. This fund invests in technology companies that the portfolio managers believe demonstrate a market leading business model with competitive advantage, a history of growing revenue, profit and tangible book value, an efficient and conservative balance sheet, long-term revenue and earnings growth potential, and solid prospects for sustainable profitability. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Japan Fund (investor class symbol HJPNX and institutional class symbol HJPIX). The Hennessy Japan Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in securities of Japanese companies regardless of market capitalization. This fund screens for companies that the portfolio managers believe have strong business and management, and are trading at an attractive price, thus identifying stocks with a &#147;value gap.&#148; The portfolio is limited to its portfolio managers&#146; best ideas, and has a concentrated number of holdings. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund (investor class symbol HJPSX and institutional class symbol HJSIX). The Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing in securities of smaller Japanese companies, defined as those with market capitalizations in the bottom 15% of all Japanese companies. This fund screens for small capitalization companies that the portfolio managers believe have strong businesses and management, and are trading at an attractive price, thus identifying stocks with a &#147;value gap.&#148; The portfolio is limited to its portfolio managers&#146; best ideas and is unconfined to benchmarks.

Development of New Investment Strategies and Expanding Our Product Offerings 

We develop new investment strategies or expand our product offerings by identifying client needs and reviewing asset allocation tables to determine where we can augment our family of mutual funds. Once we identify an attractive market segment, we select one of the following methods to initiate the new strategy. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We screen the appropriate universe of stocks with a set of parameters that we believe identifies stocks that will produce higher long-term returns with lower associated risk than their relative indices. We then introduce the new investment strategy into the marketplace by opening and directly marketing a new mutual fund. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We purchase the assets related to the management of an existing mutual fund that we then manage ourselves. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We purchase the assets related to the management of an existing mutual fund and then engage the existing portfolio managers or strategic firm to act as a sub-advisor to manage the fund. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We purchase the assets related to the management of an existing mutual fund and then employ the existing portfolio management team to manage the fund. ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, SOURCES OF REVENUES AND 12B-1 PLANS 

We earn revenues primarily by providing investment advisory services to the Hennessy Funds and secondarily by providing shareholder services to shareholders of the Hennessy Funds. The fees we receive for these services are calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the Hennessy Funds. In addition, the sub-advisor fees that we pay are also calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset values of the sub-advised Hennessy Funds. The amount of our assets under management fluctuates as a result of organic inflows (purchases of shares of the Hennessy Funds by new or existing shareholders), acquisition inflows, outflows (redemptions of shares of the Hennessy Funds by shareholders), and market appreciation or depreciation. 

The following table summarizes our assets under management for the past five fiscal years:

The management contracts also provide that we are responsible for performing any ordinary clerical and bookkeeping services needed by the Hennessy Funds that are not provided by the funds&#146; custodian, administrator or transfer agent. The Funds&#146; Board of Trustees is comprised of our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Neil J. Hennessy, and three trustees who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds (the &#147;disinterested trustees&#148;). Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a majority of the disinterested trustees must approve the entry into and continuation of our management contracts. The disinterested trustees also have sole responsibility for selecting and nominating other disinterested trustees. 

&#160;

In exchange for the services described above, we receive an investment advisory fee from each of the Hennessy Funds, which is calculated as a percentage of each fund&#146;s average daily net asset value. As of September 30, 2016, the percentages upon which the annual investment advisory fees payable to us by the Hennessy Funds are based are as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; 0.90% Hennessy Japan Fund*

&#160; 0.80% Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund*

&#160; 0.80% &#160;

&#160; * The investment advisory fee for the Hennessy Japan Fund was reduced from 1.00% to 0.80% and the investment advisory fee for the Hennessy Japan Small Cap Fund was reduced from 1.20% to 0.80%, each effective as of March 1, 2016. &#160; In the past, the Company has waived fees or absorbed expenses with respect to some of the Hennessy Funds to comply with contractual expense ratio limitations to the extent necessary to ensure that the net expenses of the applicable funds did not exceed a specified percentage of the average daily net assets of such funds, but all such expense ratio limitations expired or were terminated as of February 28, 2015. To date, the Company has only waived fees based on contractual obligations, but the Company has the ability to waive fees at its discretion to compete with other mutual funds with lower expense ratios. If the Company were to elect voluntarily to waive fees, the decision to waive fees would not apply to previous periods, but would only apply on a going forward basis. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has never voluntarily waived fees, and has no current intention to voluntarily waive fees. 

Our management contracts must be renewed annually by (i) the Funds&#146; Board of Trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the applicable Hennessy Fund and (ii) by the vote of a majority of the trustees of Hennessy Funds Trust who are not interested persons of the Hennessy Funds. If the management contracts are not renewed annually as described above, they will terminate automatically. In addition, there are two other circumstances in which the management contracts would terminate. First, the management contracts would automatically terminate if the Company assigned them to another advisor (assignment includes &#147;indirect assignment,&#148; which is the transfer of the Company&#146;s common stock in sufficient quantities deemed to constitute a controlling block). Second, each management contract may be terminated prior to its expiration upon 60 days&#146; notice by either the Company or the applicable Hennessy Fund. 

Sub-advisory Agreements and Fees 

For six of the Hennessy Funds acquired through asset purchases, we have delegated the day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities to sub-advisors. In each case, the sub-advisor entity or the individuals working at the sub-advisor entity are the same entities or individuals who advised the fund prior to our purchase of the assets related to the management of such fund. The services that each sub-advisor provides to the applicable Hennessy Fund pursuant to the terms of the sub-advisory agreement we have with such sub-advisor include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; acting as portfolio manager for the fund, which includes managing the composition of the fund&#146;s portfolio (including the purchase, retention, and disposition of portfolio securities in accordance with the fund&#146;s investment objectives, policies, and restrictions), seeking best execution for the fund&#146;s portfolio, managing the use of soft dollars for the fund, and managing proxy voting for the fund; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ensuring that its compliance programs include policies and procedures relevant to the fund and the sub-advisor&#146;s duties as a portfolio manager to the fund; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; preparing a written summary of the fund&#146;s performance for the most recent twelve-month period for each annual report of the fund; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; providing a quarterly certification to Hennessy Funds Trust regarding trading and allocation practices, supervisory matters, the sub-advisor&#146;s compliance program (including its code of ethics), compliance with the fund&#146;s policies, and general firm updates. &#160;

These sub-advisory services must be delivered in accordance with the terms of the sub-advisory agreement and the sub-advised fund&#146;s Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information, all as subject to the direction, supervision and control of us and the Funds&#146; Board of Trustees. In exchange for sub-advisory services, we pay sub-advisory fees to the sub-advisors out of our own assets. Sub-advisory fees are calculated as a percentage of the applicable sub-advised fund&#146;s average daily net asset value. The following table lists each of our sub-advised funds, the sub-advisor entity for each fund and the percentage upon which the annual sub-advisory fees payable by us to the applicable sub-advisor are based:

&#160; * For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, Financial Counselors, Inc. contractually agreed to reduce its sub-advisory fee to 0.15% of the average daily net asset value of the Hennessy Core Bond Fund. &#160; The sub-advisory agreements must be renewed annually in the same manner and are subject to the same termination provisions as the management contracts. 

Shareholder Servicing Agreements and Fees 

We provide shareholder services to the entire family of the Hennessy Funds pursuant to a shareholder servicing agreement with Hennessy Funds Trust covering the Investor Class shares of such funds (although we have only earned shareholder service fees from Investor Class shares of all of (versus only some of) the Hennessy Funds since March 1, 2015). The shareholder services that we provide for the Hennessy Funds include, among other things, the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; maintaining an &#147;800&#148; number that the current investors of the Hennessy Funds may call to ask questions about the Hennessy Funds or their accounts with the Hennessy Funds; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; assisting the investors in the Hennessy Funds with processing exchange and redemption requests; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; assisting the investors in the Hennessy Funds with changing dividend options, account designations and addresses; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; responding generally to questions from investors in the Hennessy Funds; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; providing other similar services that the Hennessy Funds may request. &#160;

In exchange for the services described above, we receive a shareholder service fee from each of the Hennessy Funds, which is calculated as a percentage of the average daily net asset value of each fund&#146;s Investor Class shares. The following table lists each of the Hennessy Funds and the percentages upon which the annual shareholder service fees paid to us by the Hennessy Funds are based:

&#160; * Commenced March 1, 2015. &#160; 12b-1 Plans 

All of the Hennessy Funds have adopted a 12b-1 plan. These plans are named after Rule 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which permits mutual funds to adopt a plan that allows them to collect fees that can be used to make payments to third parties in connection with the distribution of their fund shares. Amounts paid under the plans may be spent on any activities or expenses primarily intended to result in sale of shares of the funds, including but not limited to, (i) advertising, (ii) compensation paid to financial institutions, broker-dealers, and others for sales and marketing, (iii) shareholder accounting servicing, (iv) the printing and mailing of prospectuses to possible new shareholders and (v) the printing and mailing of sales literature. Mutual funds may also employ a distributor to distribute and market their fund shares and use 12b-1 fees to pay the distributor for expenses incurred for telephone costs, overhead costs, costs of employees who engage in or support the distribution of the fund shares, the printing of prospectuses and other reports for possible new shareholders, advertising and the preparation and distribution of sales literature. 

The 12b-1 fees for each of the Hennessy Funds is calculated as a percentage of such fund&#146;s average daily net asset value. The following table lists each of the Hennessy Funds and the percentage upon which the 12b-1 fees are based:

CUSTODIAL AND BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS 

A third party custodian acts as custodian for all of our assets under management. 

All trades for the Hennessy Funds are executed by independent brokerage firms following our direction or that of our sub-advisors. When selecting brokers, we and our sub-advisors are required to seek &#147;best execution.&#148; Although there is no single statutory definition, Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) releases and other legal guidelines make clear that the duty to seek best execution requires us to seek &#147;the most advantageous terms reasonably available under the circumstances for a customer&#146;s account.&#148; The lowest possible commission, while important, is not the sole determinative factor. We and our sub-advisors also consider factors such as order size and market depth, availability of competing markets and liquidity, trading characteristics of the security, financial responsibility of the broker-dealer and the broker&#146;s ability to address current market conditions. 

Currently, we participate in &#147;soft dollar&#148; arrangements with some of our brokers. This means that we receive research reports and real-time electronic research to assist us in trading and managing the Hennessy Funds. Under these soft dollar arrangements, the Hennessy Funds pay brokerage commissions for securities trades at the regular, market rate and some or all of the value of those commissions is received by us in the form of research or other services that benefit the Hennessy Funds. Our soft dollar arrangements comply with SEC guidance regarding soft dollars. 

LICENSE AGREEMENT 

Our ability to use the names and formulaic investment strategies of the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund are governed by the terms and conditions of a license agreement, dated as of April 10, 2000, with Netfolio, Inc. (formerly known as O&#146;Shaughnessy Capital Management, Inc.). Under the license agreement, Netfolio, Inc. granted us a perpetual, paid-up, royalty-free, exclusive license to use certain trademarks, such as &#147;Strategy Indexing,&#148; &#147;Cornerstone Growth&#148; and &#147;Cornerstone Value,&#148; as well as the formula investment strategies used by the Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund and the Hennessy Cornerstone Value Fund. All of our advertising, marketing, promotional and other materials incorporating or referring to the trademarks are subject to the prior written approval of Netfolio, Inc., except that we do not need Netfolio, Inc.&#146;s prior written approval to use the trademarks in a manner that is not substantially unchanged from any prior use by Netfolio, Inc. in its own business or from any prior use by us previously approved by Netfolio, Inc. We have the right to assign the license to another person or entity if the assignee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the license agreement. There are no ongoing licensing fees associated with this license agreement and Netfolio, Inc. does not have any contractual rights to terminate the license agreement. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

From the time we launched our first mutual fund in 1996 through the end of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we have grown our assets under management to approximately $6.7 billion. During that time, we have consistently pursued a growth strategy centered on organic growth through our marketing and sales efforts and growth through strategic purchases of management-related assets. The implementation of this business strategy is described below. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Delivering strong investment performance of the Hennessy Funds One of the most effective ways we can grow the assets of the Hennessy Funds is by delivering strong investment performance, which we believe should: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; result in an increase in the value of existing assets of the Hennessy Funds; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; encourage more investors to buy shares of the Hennessy Funds and decrease the number of investors who redeem their shares and leave the Hennessy Funds; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; motivate current investors to invest additional money in the Hennessy Funds. &#160;

&#149; &#160; Utilizing our branding and marketing campaign to attract assets We believe we can attract investors to the Hennessy Funds by effectively marketing our consistent and repeatable investment process that combines time-tested stock selection strategies with a highly disciplined, team-managed approach. We offer both quantitative funds and actively-managed funds. We believe our quantitative funds will attract investors who want to understand exactly how their investments are managed and who favor statistical analysis and empirical evidence as the basis for investment decisions. Alternatively, we believe that our actively-managed funds will attract investors who appreciate a fundamental, hands-on investment management approach and talented portfolio managers. We also believe our more conservative, income-generating funds will attract investors seeking an alternative to mutual funds invested entirely in equities. 

&#160;

We run a comprehensive and far reaching public relations program designed to disseminate our message through frequent television appearances, radio spots, feature articles and print media mentions to a wide variety of potential investors. Our public relations program has consistently resulted in the Hennessy Funds being mentioned in national print and broadcast media an average of once every two to three days on such media such as CNBC, Fox News, Bloomberg radio and TV, The Wall Street Journal, Kiplingers, Barron&#146;s, among others. To facilitate our presence in the media, we installed LiveStudio, an in-house studio providing a direct link to media broadcasts, at our office in Novato, CA. Along with our primary spokesperson, Neil J. Hennessy, who is our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board and President, Chief Investment Officer and a Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds, we also utilize the following Portfolio Managers of the Hennessy Funds as spokespersons: Brian Peery, David Ellison, Winsor (Skip) Aylesworth and Ryan Kelley. These additional spokespersons have enabled us to further expand our public relations program. We also include our sub-advisors for media coverage to promote our sub-advised funds. 

We maintain and regularly update a robust website. We also utilize more focused marketing efforts, such as sending informational and promotional communications, fund performance updates, news articles pertaining to the Hennessy Funds and Portfolio Manager commentaries to investors and prospective investors. We also participate in exhibitions at select investment advisor trade shows throughout the year. Additionally, we attend strategic industry-related conferences, and Mr. Hennessy participates as a moderator or guest speaker on industry-related panels whenever the opportunity arises. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Expanding our distribution network to additional mutual fund platforms One of the ways investors may purchase shares of the Hennessy Funds is through mutual fund supermarkets, such as Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and Pershing. Mutual fund supermarkets generally offer funds of many different investment companies to investors, in exchange for a services fee paid by the applicable fund or that fund&#146;s investment advisor. This ability to purchase various mutual funds in a single location is very attractive to investors. The majority of our $6.7 billion of assets under management as of September 30, 2016, are held at mutual fund supermarkets. 

Investments in the Hennessy Funds are also available through national wire houses and broker-dealers, as well as independent and regional broker-dealers. We see continued opportunities to form new relationships with these financial institutions, thereby enhancing the accessibility of our no-load mutual funds to investors. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Increasing our current base of financial advisors and investment professionals Investment professionals generally have access to a wide variety of investment products they may recommend to their investors. A recommendation by an investment professional to an investor to buy one of the Hennessy Funds may greatly influence that investor. Thus, we believe that expanding our current base of investment professionals who utilize no-load funds for their investors will help us increase our assets under management, which will in turn increase our revenues. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Securing participation on the platforms of national, full-service firms We continually strive to develop relationships with national full-service firms that permit their investment professionals to offer no-load funds to their investors as a way to increase the amount of assets that we manage, which will in turn increase our revenues. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Pursuing strategic purchases of management agreements for additional mutual funds A primary component of our growth strategy is to selectively pursue strategic purchases of assets related to management of additional mutual funds. We believe the regulatory burden imposed upon the mutual fund industry, along with increased competition, has compressed the margins of smaller to mid-sized mutual fund managers, making those managers more receptive to an asset purchase. We believe that we are well prepared to benefit from these attractive asset purchase trends and from the increasing supply of potential targets. In addition, we believe there are a number of attractive asset purchase opportunities from mutual fund managers who are reaching retirement age or who are leaving the mutual fund management arena. We have generally been able to offer lower overall expense ratios to the shareholders of purchased funds. In some instances, we have also been able to improve performance. 

Through our asset purchase strategy, we have successfully completed eight asset purchases of management-related assets over a 16-year period, and we have efficiently integrated $3.7 billion of net assets of 25 different mutual funds into the Hennessy Funds family. Our most recent asset purchase was completed on September 23, 2016, when we purchased assets related to the management of The Westport Funds, which added an additional $435 million to our assets under management. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Delivering strong, high-quality financial results. We seek to maintain a strong financial position and to manage our investment advisory business to meet the highest regulatory, ethical and business standards and to maintain continuity of service to all of the investors in the Hennessy Funds. 

COMPETITION 

The investment advisory industry is highly competitive, with new competitors continually entering the industry. We compete directly with numerous global and U.S. investment managers, commercial banks, savings and loans associations, brokerage and investment banking firms, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions that often provide investment products with similar features and objectives to those we offer. These institutions range from small boutique firms to large financial services complexes. We are considered a small investment advisory company. Many competing companies are part of larger financial services companies that conduct business in more markets and have greater marketing, financial, technical, research and distribution resources and other capabilities than we do. Most of the larger firms offer a broader range of financial services to the same retail and institutional investors we seek to serve. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage, and we can give no assurance that our strategies and efforts to maintain and enhance our current investor relationships, as well as to create new ones, will be successful. To grow our business, we must be able to compete effectively for assets under management. Key competitive factors include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the investment performance for the Hennessy Funds; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the expense ratios of the Hennessy Funds; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the array of our product offerings; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; industry rankings for the Hennessy Funds; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the quality of our services; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to further develop and market our brand; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our commitment to placing the interests of investors first; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; our general business reputation. Increased competition could reduce the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Competition is an important risk that our business faces and should be considered along with other risk factors that we discuss in Item 1A, &#147;Risk Factors,&#148; below. 

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 

We are subject to extensive and increasing federal and state laws and regulations intended to protect shareholders of mutual funds and investors of registered investment advisors. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations. 

We are registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and therefore must comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related SEC regulations. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to investors, engaging in transactions with investors, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an advisor and advisory investors, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements and general anti-fraud provisions. 

We manage accounts for the Hennessy Funds on a discretionary basis, with authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker-dealers to execute trades, and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker-dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All of our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase. 

&#160;

Our mutual funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which imposes additional obligations on both the funds and the advisor, including detailed operational requirements. While we exercise broad discretion over the day-to-day management of the business and affairs of the Hennessy Funds and the investment portfolios of the Hennessy Funds, our own operations are subject to oversight and management by the Funds&#146; Board of Trustees. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, a majority of the trustees must not be &#147;interested persons&#148; with respect to us (sometimes referred to as the &#147;independent trustee&#148; requirement). The responsibilities of the Funds&#146; Board of Trustees include, among other things, annually approving the continuation of our investment management agreements with the Hennessy Funds, approving other service providers, determining the method of valuing assets, and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. The Investment Company Act of 1940 also imposes on the investment advisor to a mutual fund a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of the advisor&#146;s investment management fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action, or by litigation by investors in the Hennessy Funds pursuant to a private right of action. 

The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, ranging from fines and censures to the suspension of individual employees to termination of an investment advisor&#146;s registration. A violation of applicable law or regulations could also subject us, our directors and our employees to civil actions brought by private parties. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable SEC requirements. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of September 30, 2016, we employed twenty-two employees, twenty-one of which are full-time employees. 

The executive officers of the company are Neil J. Hennessy, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of our Board of Directors; Teresa M. Nilsen, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and a member of our Board of Directors; and Daniel B. Steadman, Executive Vice President in charge of expansion, Chief Compliance Officer and a member of our Board of Directors. In addition to our executive officers&#146; responsibilities at Hennessy Advisors, Inc., Mr. Hennessy serves as President and Portfolio Manager of the Hennessy Funds and is a member of the Funds&#146; Board of Trustees, Ms. Nilsen is an Executive Vice President and Treasurer of the Hennessy Funds and Mr. Steadman is an Executive Vice President and Secretary of the Hennessy Funds.
