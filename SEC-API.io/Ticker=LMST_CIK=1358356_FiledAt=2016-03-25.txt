Business 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Porter Bancorp, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a bank holding company headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky. We operate the tenth largest bank domiciled in the Commonwealth of Kentucky based on total assets through our wholly owned subsidiary PBI Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). We operate 15 banking offices in twelve counties in Kentucky. Our markets include metropolitan Louisville in Jefferson County and the surrounding counties of Henry and Bullitt. We serve south central Kentucky and southern Kentucky from banking offices in Butler, Green, Hart, Edmonson, Barren, Warren, Ohio, and Daviess Counties. We also have an office in Lexington, the second largest city in Kentucky. The Bank is a community bank with a wide range of commercial and personal banking products. As of December 31, 2015, we had total assets of $948.7 million, total loans of $618.7 million, total deposits of $878.0 million and stockholders&#8217; equity of $32.0 million. 

&#160; 

Our Markets

Brands, Papa John&#8217;s Pizza, and Texas Roadhouse. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Lexington/Fayette County: Lexington, located in Fayette County, is the second largest city in Kentucky. Lexington is the financial, educational, retail, healthcare and cultural hub for Central and Eastern Kentucky. It is known worldwide for its horse farms and Keeneland Race Track, and proudly boasts of itself as &#8220;The Horse Capital of the World.&#8221; It is also the home of the University of Kentucky and Transylvania University. The area&#8217;s major employers include Toyota, Lexmark, IBM Global Services and Valvoline. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Southern Kentucky: This market includes Bowling Green, the third largest city in Kentucky, located about 60 miles north of Nashville, Tennessee. Bowling Green, located in Warren County, is the home of Western Kentucky University and is the economic hub of the area. This market also includes communities in the contiguous Barren County, including the city of Glasgow. Major employers in Barren and Warren Counties include GM&#8217;s Corvette plant, several other automotive facilities, and R.R. Donnelley&#8217;s regional printing facility. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

Owensboro/Daviess County: Owensboro, located on the banks of the Ohio River, is Kentucky&#8217;s fourth largest city. The city is called a festival city, with over 20 annual community celebrations that attract visitors from around the world, including its world famous Bar-B-Q Festival which attracts over 80,000 visitors. It is an industrial, medical, retail and cultural hub for Western Kentucky and the area employers include Owensboro Medical System, Texas Gas, US Bank Home Mortgage and Toyotetsu. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9632; 

South Central Kentucky: South of the Louisville metropolitan area, we have banking offices in Butler, Edmonson, Green, Hart, and Ohio Counties. This region includes stable community markets comprised primarily of agricultural and service-based businesses. Each of our banking offices in these markets has a stable customer and core deposit base. 

&#160; 

Our Products and Services&#160; 

&#160; 

We meet our customers&#8217; banking needs with a broad range of financial products and services. Our lending services include real estate, commercial, mortgage, agriculture, and consumer loans to small to medium-sized businesses, the owners and employees of those businesses, as well as other executives and professionals. We complement our lending operations with an array of retail and commercial deposit products. In addition, we offer our customers drive-through banking facilities, automatic teller machines, night depository, personalized checks, credit cards, debit cards, internet banking, mobile banking, treasury management services, remote deposit services, electronic funds transfers through ACH services, domestic and foreign wire transfers, cash management, vault services, along with loan and deposit sweep accounts. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had 244 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and management considers the Company&#8217;s relationship with employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Competition&#160; 

&#160; 

The banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition from many other financial institutions. Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the quality and scope of the services offered, the convenience of banking facilities and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices within our market area and beyond. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

Consent Order and Written Agreement. On June 24, 2011, the Bank entered into a consent order (the &#8220;Consent Order&#8221;) with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (&#8220;KDFI&#8221;). The Bank agreed to obtain the written consent of both agencies before declaring or paying any future dividends. The Consent Order established benchmarks for the Bank to improve its asset quality, reduce its loan concentrations, and maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9% and a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 12%. 

&#160; 

On September 21, 2011, we entered into a written agreement (&#8220;Written Agreement&#8221;) with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Company made formal commitments in the Written Agreement to use its financial and management resources to serve as a source of strength for the Bank and to assist the Bank in addressing weaknesses identified by the FDIC and the KDFI, to pay no dividends without prior written approval, to pay no interest or principal on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities without written approval, and to submit an acceptable plan to maintain sufficient capital. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Consent Order with the FDIC and KDFI was subsequently revised in October 2012 and October 2015. In the most recent revision, the Bank continues to agree to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9% and a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 12%. The Bank also agrees that if it should be unable to reach the required capital levels, and if directed in writing by the FDIC, then the Bank would within 30 days develop, adopt and implement a written plan to sell or merge itself into another federally insured financial institution or otherwise obtain a capital investment into the Bank sufficient to recapitalize the Bank. The Bank has not been directed by the FDIC to implement such a plan. The most recent Consent Order includes several of the substantive provisions of the prior Consent Orders, but omits previous provisions related to reducing loan concentrations, which the Bank has satisfied. It also requires the Bank to continue to adhere to the plans implemented in response to the prior Consent Orders. 

&#160; 

We continue to work towards achieving capital ratio compliance. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.08% and its total risk-based capital ratio was 10.58%, which are below the minimums of 9.0% and 12.0% required by the Consent Order. 

&#160; 

Bank and Holding Company Laws, Rules and Regulations. The following is a summary description of the relevant laws, rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies. The descriptions of, and references to, the statutes and regulations below are brief summaries and do not purport to be complete. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes and regulations discussed. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. Because the Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of regulations with significant discretion, certain of the details of the law and the effects it will have on the Company are not known at this time. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States. There are a number of reform provisions that significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies, including us, do business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance premiums by modifying the assessment base calculation to be based on a depository institution&#8217;s consolidated assets less tangible capital instead of deposits, and permanently increased the standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer to $250,000. The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by, among other things, imposing leverage ratios on bank holding companies and prohibiting new trust preferred security issuances from counting as Tier I capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also repealed the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. The Act codified and expanded the Federal Reserve&#8217;s source of strength doctrine, which requires that all bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks. Other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act include, but are not limited to: (i) the creation of a new financial consumer protection agency that is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection; (ii) enhanced regulation of financial markets, including derivatives and securitization markets; (iii) reform related to the regulation of credit rating agencies; (iv) the elimination of certain trading activities by banks; and (v) new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance. 

&#160; 

Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require interpretation and rule-making by federal agencies. The Company monitors all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations. While the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company is not fully known, the law is likely to result in greater compliance costs and higher fees paid to regulators, along with possible restrictions on the Company&#8217;s operations. 

&#160; 

Porter Bancorp. The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). As such, we must file with the Federal Reserve Board annual and quarterly reports and other information regarding our business operations and the business operations of our subsidiaries. We are also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board and to operational guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board. We are subject to the Bank Holding Company Act and other federal laws on the types of activities in which we may engage, and to other supervisory requirements, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Acquisitions. A bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company and before engaging, or acquiring a company that is not a bank but is engaged in certain non-banking activities. Federal law also prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company without notifying the Federal Reserve Board in advance, and then may only do so if the Federal Reserve Board does not object to the proposed transaction. The Federal Reserve Board has established a rebuttable presumptive standard that the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a bank holding company would constitute an acquisition of control of the bank holding company. In addition, any company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of any class of a bank holding company&#8217;s voting securities, or otherwise obtaining control or a &#8220;controlling influence&#8221; over a bank holding company. 

&#160; 

Permissible Activities . A bank holding company is generally permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding company or company engaged in any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. 

&#160; 

Under current federal law, a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company, which enables the holding company to conduct activities that are &#8220;financial in nature,&#8221; incidental to financial activity, or complementary to financial activity that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Activities that are &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking. No regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board. We have not filed an election to become a financial holding company. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements . Both the Company and the Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy guidelines. Guidelines are established by the Federal Reserve Board for the Company and the FDIC for the Bank. Both the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have substantially similar risk based and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations, which are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital related to the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The capital adequacy guidelines are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. The Bank is subject to a Consent Order with its primary regulators and therefore cannot be considered well-capitalized. The Consent Order calls for a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.0% and a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.0%. PBI Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio and total-risk based capital ratios were 6.08% and 10.58%, respectively at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC approved final rules that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company and Bank. The final rules implement the regulatory capital reforms of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reflected in &#8220;Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems&#8221; (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;) and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms became effective for the Company and Bank on January 1, 2015, and include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. These rules refine the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for purposes of calculating the capital ratios. 

&#160; 

The Basel III minimum capital level requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks subject to the rules are &#160; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also establish a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5%, to be phased in over three years, above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. Once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the minimum ratios area common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. 

&#160; 

The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement begins in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Under these new rules, Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Tier 2 capital may consist of subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments, qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses. Proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital unless issued before 2010 by an institution with less than $15 billion of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (&#8220;FDIA&#8221;), the FDIC must take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. FDIC regulations define the levels at which an insured institution would be considered &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; A bank is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized. A depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. The degree of regulatory scrutiny increases and the permissible activities of a bank decrease, as the bank moves downward through the capital categories. Depending on a bank&#8217;s level of capital, the FDIC&#8217;s corrective powers include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

requiring a capital restoration plan; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

placing limits on asset growth and restriction on activities; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

requiring the bank to issue additional voting or other capital stock or to be acquired; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

placing restrictions on transactions with affiliates; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

restricting the interest rate the bank may pay on deposits; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

ordering a new election of the bank&#8217;s board of directors; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

requiring that certain senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

prohibiting the bank from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

requiring the bank to divest certain subsidiaries; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

ultimately, appointing a receiver for the bank. 

&#160; 

If an institution is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the institution&#8217;s holding company must guarantee the subsidiary&#8217;s compliance with the capital restoration plan up to a certain specified amount. Any such guarantee from a depository institution&#8217;s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy. The aggregate liability of the holding company of an undercapitalized bank is limited to the lesser of 5% of the institution&#8217;s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to cause the institution to be &#8220;adequately capitalized.&#8221; The bank regulators have greater power in situations where an institution becomes &#8220;significantly&#8221; or &#8220;critically&#8221; undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval of proposed dividends, or might be required to consent to a consolidation or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates. 

&#160; 

Dividends. Under Federal Reserve Board policy, bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not declare a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Historically, the majority of our revenue has been from dividends paid to us by the Bank. The Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. If, in the opinion of a federal regulatory agency, an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, the agency may require, after notice and hearing, that the institution cease such practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (&#8220;FDICIA&#8221;), an insured institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. A bank holding company may still declare and pay a dividend if it does not have current operating earnings if the bank holding company expects profits for the entire year and the bank holding company obtains the prior consent of the Federal Reserve. The Company and the Bank must obtain the prior written consent of each of their primary regulators prior to declaring or paying any future dividends. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Under Kentucky law, dividends by Kentucky banks may be paid only from current or retained net profits. Before any dividend may be declared for any period (other than with respect to preferred stock), a bank must increase its capital surplus by at least 10% of the net profits of the bank for the period until the bank&#8217;s capital surplus equals the amount of its stated capital attributable to its common stock. Moreover, the KDFI must approve the declaration of dividends if the total dividends to be declared by a bank for any calendar year would exceed the bank&#8217;s total net profits for such year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of preferred stock or debt. We are also subject to the Kentucky Business Corporation Act, which generally prohibits dividends to the extent they result in the insolvency of the corporation from a balance sheet perspective or in the corporation becoming unable to pay its debts as they come due. The Bank did not pay any dividends in 2015 or 2014. 

&#160; 

With respect to the payment of dividends, Porter Bancorp&#8217;s issued and outstanding Series E and Series F Preferred Shares rank senior to its common shares and non-voting common shares. 

&#160; 

Source of Financial Strength . Under Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, its bank subsidiaries. This support may be required at times when, absent such a policy, the bank holding company may not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by the bank holding company to its bank subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiary. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of subsidiary banks will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;Source of Financial Strength&#8221; policy was codified in the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160; 

PBI Bank. The Bank, a Kentucky chartered commercial bank, is subject to regular bank examinations and other supervision and regulation by both the FDIC and the KDFI. Kentucky&#8217;s banking statutes contain a &#8220;super-parity&#8221; provision that permits a well-rated Kentucky banking corporation to engage in any banking activity which could be engaged in by a national bank operating in any state; a state bank, a thrift or savings bank operating in any other state; or a federal chartered thrift or federal savings association meeting the qualified thrift lender test and operating in any state could engage, provided the Kentucky bank first obtains a legal opinion specifying the statutory or regulatory provisions that permit the activity. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements . Please see capital adequacy requirements discussion above. As previously discussed, PBI Bank has agreed with its primary regulators to maintain a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets of at least 12.0% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9%. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets was 10.58% and its Tier I leverage ratio was 6.08%, both under the ratios required by the Consent Order. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance Assessments. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the &#8220;Reform Act&#8221;). Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act imposed additional assessments and costs with respect to deposits. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance assessments based on total assets rather than total deposits. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC revised the deposit insurance assessment system and implemented a revised assessment rate process with the goal of differentiating insured depository institutions who pose greater risk to the DIF. 

&#160; 

Safety and Soundness Standards. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to these matters. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; provisions of FDIA. See &#8220;Prompt Corrective Actions&#8221; above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Branching. Kentucky law permits Kentucky chartered banks to establish a banking office in any county in Kentucky. A Kentucky bank may also establish a banking office outside of Kentucky. Well capitalized Kentucky banks that have been in operation at least three years and satisfy certain criteria relating to, among other things, their composite and management ratings, may establish a banking office in Kentucky without the approval of the KDFI upon notice to the KDFI and any other state bank with its main office located in the county where the new banking office will be located. Branching by all other banks requires the approval of the KDFI, which must ascertain and determine that the public convenience and advantage will be served and promoted and that there is reasonable probability of the successful operation of the banking office. The transaction must also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community and consistency with corporate powers. 

&#160; 

Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act effectively eliminated the interstate branching restrictions set forth in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. Banks located in any state may now de novo branch in any other state, including Kentucky. Such unlimited branching power may increase competition within the markets in which the Company and the Bank operate. 

&#160; 

Insider Credit Transactions . The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to as &#8220;insiders&#8221;) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests, which may not exceed the institution&#8217;s total unimpaired capital and surplus. 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Laws. The Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statues and regulations promulgated under those laws, including, but not limited to, the: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans; 

&#160; &#9679;

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Federal preemption of state consumer protection law requirements, traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter, has also been modified by the Dodd-Frank Act and now requires a case-by-case determination of preemption by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank. Depending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard, the operations of the Bank could become subject to additional compliance burdens in the states in which it operates. 

&#160; 

Loans to One Borrower. Under current limits, loans and extensions of credit outstanding at one time to a single borrower and not fully secured generally may not exceed 15% of an institution&#8217;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral may represent an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule . On December 10, 2013, the final Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act was approved and implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Volcker Rule attempts to reduce risk and banking system instability by restricting U.S. banks from investing in or engaging in proprietary trading and speculation and imposing a strict framework to justify exemptions for underwriting, market-making and hedging activities. U.S. banks will be restricted from investing in funds with collateral comprised of less than 100% loans that are not registered with the SEC and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. We do not believe the Volcker Rule will have a significant effect on the Bank&#8217;s operations. 

&#160; 

Privacy. Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institution&#8217;s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers&#8217; nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requires the FDIC to assess our record in meeting the credit needs of the communities we serve, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. The FDIC&#8217;s assessment of our record is made available to the public. The assessment also is part of the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s consideration of applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, to establish a new banking office or to relocate an office. 

&#160; 

Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) was enacted to deter money laundering, establish regulatory reporting standards for currency transactions and improve detection and investigation of criminal, tax and other regulatory violations. BSA and subsequent laws and regulations require us to take steps to prevent the use of the Bank in the flow of illegal or illicit money, including, without limitation, ensuring effective management oversight, establishing sound policies and procedures, developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities, ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive internal audit of BSA compliance activities. In recent years, federal regulators have increased the attention paid to compliance with the provisions of BSA and related laws, with particular attention paid to &#8220;Know Your Customer&#8221; practices. Banks have been encouraged by regulators to enhance their identification procedures prior to accepting new customers in order to deter criminal elements from using the banking system to move and hide illegal and illicit activities. 

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) contains anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. This includes standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, as well as rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. It grants the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on the operations of financial institutions. In addition, the Patriot Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution&#8217;s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Effect on Economic Environment. The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve Board to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on our business and earnings and those of our subsidiaries cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

Recently Enacted and Future Legislation. From time to time various laws, regulations and governmental programs affecting financial institutions and the financial industry are introduced in Congress or otherwise promulgated by regulatory agencies. Such measures may change the environment in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate in substantial and unpredictable ways. The nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are unpredictable at this time. &#160; Future legislation, policies and the effects thereof might have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits. They also may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits. New legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.
