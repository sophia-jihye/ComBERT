Corporate Overview 

PureBase Corporation (&#8220;PureBase&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, "we", or "our")was incorporated in Nevada on March 2, 2010 under the name Port of Call Online, Inc. (referred to herein as &#8220;POCO&#8221;). POCO was originally formed to develop web-based services that would offer boaters online resources to help plan and organize boating trips. Since POCO had no revenues and minimal assets it was identified as a &#8220;shell company&#8221; as defined by SEC regulations. 

On September 24, 2014 the two officers and Directors of POCO as well as most of its then stockholders agreed to sell their shares of POCO common stock to Arthur Scott Dockter resulting in Mr. Dockter owning approximately 82% of the then outstanding shares of POCO. At this time Joseph Shea, tendered his resignation as POCO&#8217;s President, CEO, CFO and Director to be effective September 24, 2014, and Gertrude Shea tendered her resignation as POCO&#8217;s Secretary and Director to be effective September 24, 2014 and Scott Dockter was appointed POCO&#8217;s President, CEO, CFO, Secretary and Director effective as of September 24, 2014.As a result of this change in control, Mr. Dockter announced that POCO would no longer pursue the web-based boater services business but would pursue a new business model in the field of acquiring and developing minerals and natural resources for industrial and agricultural applications. 

On October 27, 2014 Mr. Dockter appointed Calvin Lim to the Board of Directors and appointed Amy Clemens as Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary. 

On November 7, 2014 POCO conducted an 8-for-1 common stock split which increased its outstanding common stock from 3,050,000 shares to 24,400,000. As a result of the stock split POCO&#8217;s authorized shares increased from 65,000,000 shares to 520,000,000 shares. 

In light of POCO&#8217;s new business focus, on December 1, 2014 POCO entered into an agreement giving it the right to acquire its first mining property interests and certain mining claims known as the Snow White Mine. 

On December 23, 2014 POCO entered into and consummated a Plan and Agreement of Reorganization between the Company and Purebase, Inc., and certain stockholders of Purebase, Inc. (the &#8220;Reorganization&#8221;). Purebase, Inc. owns various mining claims and intellectual property relevant to the minerals to be developed by the Company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, the Company acquired 87,418,824 (representing 95.5%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Purebase, Inc., a private Nevada corporation (&#8220;Purebase&#8221;) in exchange for 87,418,824 shares of the common stock of the Company. As a result of the Reorganization, Purebase became a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company and eleven former stockholders of Purebase now own, in the aggregate, approximately 61% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock. Upon consummation of this Reorganization, the Company exchanged the remaining 4,216,780 shares of issued and outstanding shares of Purebase, Inc. from its remaining stockholders on the same 1-for-1 exchange ratio. Upon the exchange of all the remaining shares of Purebase, Inc. for shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, the Company has issued a total of 91,635,604 shares of its common stock for all the outstanding shares of Purebase, Inc. resulting in an aggregate of 140,435,604 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock outstanding and Purebase, Inc. becoming a wholly-owned (rather than majority-owned) subsidiary of the Company. 

Upon consummation of the Reorganization transaction, John Bremer was appointed to the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

In order to better identify itself with its new business focus, on January 12, 2015 POCO changed its name to PureBase Corporation and was assigned the new trading symbol &#8220;PUBC&#8221;. In conjunction with this name change, Purebase, Inc. changed its name to &#8220;Purebase Agricultural, Inc.&#8221; to reflect its emphasis on developing minerals for agricultural uses. 

The Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State amending its Articles of Incorporation effective as of June 15, 2015 to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock. Consequently, as of June 15, 2015 the total shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock outstanding increased from 70,422,780 to 140,845,560. The Registrant&#8217;s authorized shares of common stock remained unchanged at 520,000,000. The Registrant&#8217;s authorized shares of preferred stock remained unchanged at 10,000,000. 

On September 24, 2015, the Board appointed John Gingerich as a Director bringing the total number of Directors to four. 

The Company&#8217; executive offices are located at 1670 Sierra Avenue, Suite 402, Yuba City, CA 95993. The Company&#8217;s telephone number is (530) 676-7873 and on the Web at www.purebase.com . 

The Company&#8217;s Business 

As indicated above, the Company acquired most of its business and assets through the reorganization with Purebase, Inc. which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary called Purebase Agricultural, Inc. (&#8220;Purebase Ag&#8221;). Purebase Ag was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 11, 2013 as an exploration and mining company which will focus on identifying and developing advanced stage natural resource projects which show potential to achieve full production. The Company&#8217;s current organizational structure is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

PureBase is a diversified, industrial mineral and natural resource company working to provide solutions to a wide range of markets, including the cornerstone markets of agriculture and construction. PureBase&#8217;s key management has over 50 years of combined experience in the mining industry in California and the USA. PureBase&#8217;s business is divided into wholly-owned subsidiaries which will operate as business divisions whose sole focus is to develop sector related products and to provide for distribution of those products into each industry related sector. 

Through Purebase Ag, the Company&#8217;s business strategy is to identify, acquire, define, develop and operate world-class industrial and natural resource properties and to provide mine development and operations services to mining properties located initially in the Western United States and currently in California and Nevada. The Company intends to engage in the identification, acquisition, development, mining and full-scale exploitation of industrial and natural mineral properties in the United States as its top priority. The Company&#8217;s business plan will initially focus on the industrial and agricultural market sectors. The Company will seek to develop mineralized materials of pozzolan, white silica and potassium sulfate. These important resources are found in thousands of products, and in many cases, there are few or no substitutes for their mineral properties. Industrial minerals have a wide range of uses including construction, agriculture additives, animal feedstock, ceramics, synthetics, absorbents and electronics. 

While the Company&#8217;s current properties contain mineralized materials of pozzolan, and potassium sulfur, among other minerals, such deposits have not yet been adequately measured and do not represent &#8220;proven&#8221; or &#8220;probable&#8221; reserves as defined in Industry Guide 7 of the federal securities regulations. 

PureBase will utilize its mining services contract to perform exploration drilling, preparation of feasibility studies, mine modeling, on-site construction, mine production and mine site reclamation. Exploration services would also include securing necessary permits, environmental compliance and reclamation plans. These services will be provided by US Mine Corp., a private company focusing on the development and contract mining of industrial mineral and metal projects throughout North America of which Scott Dockter and John Bremer are officers, directors and owners. 

The Company is focused on the Agricultural and Construction industry sectors. 

Within the Agricultural Sector, operating through Purebase Ag, the Company plans to provide soil amendment solutions that may be used by both large farming operations and consumer retail, domestically in the US and internationally. 

Within the Construction Sector, operating through Purebase Build, the Company plans to develop and market a Supplementary Cementitious Material (&#8220;SCM&#8221;), a solution that may be used in large infrastructure development projects for government, commercial industries and residential buildings. 

Agricultural Sector 

We intend to develop innovative solutions that represent an important value-enhancing element for our agricultural customers. We intend to create a brand family under the parent trade name, &#8220;Purebase&#8221;, consisting of three primary product lines: PurebaseSoluSol&#8482;, PurebaseHumate INU&#8482;, and PurebasePozzolan. 

Purebase Sulfate Advantage &#8482; provides many essential soil minerals, while lowering pH to allow nutrients to be more easily absorbed by plants, and improving soil biology. Sulfate Advantage&#8482; can be applied to most crops, trees, vines and turf applications. It will be available in granular grade and micronized solution grade, in bulk orders or 10, 20 and 50 lbs. bags. 

PurebaseHumateAdvantage&#8482; (Increased Nutrient Uptake) is derived from the combination of humic and fulvic acid coupled with a unique cross section of plant available macro and micronutrients, which allows HumateAdvantage&#8482; to simultaneously improve soil quality as well as buffer high pH conditions. Products containing humic acids, such as HumateAdvantage&#8482;, may increase uptake of micronutrients. It will be available in granular grade and available in micronized solution grade. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Purebase Draught Relief is extracted from Pozzolan deposits which originated when nearby volcanoes erupted and the volcanic ash was deposited into freshwater lakes. These freshwater lakes contained large amounts of protozoa called &#8220;diatoms&#8221;. The skeletal structures of those tiny organisms are extremely porous and adsorbent. Pozzolan can be used as a mineral soil amendment and serves as an excellent soil stabilizer and increases absorption and retention of air, water, and nutrients to sustain plant growth as well as improve porosity in the soil. Pozzolan provides an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method for plantation, water conservation and soil reclamation. A Pozzolan soil additive is also effective at removing excess heat and water in order to prevent rotting of plant roots. Other benefits of Pozzolan additives include sustained gradual release of nutrients and fertilizer, disease prevention, and increased absorption of nutrients provided by microbes and fertilizers. It will be available in granular grade, in bulk or 10, 20 and 50 lbs. bags. 

Purebase Shade Advantage is mined from a proprietary deposit of Kaolin Clay at the Ione facility. PurebaseShade Advantage is a blocker and absorber of Ultra Violet light. Kaolin Clay used in Shade Advantage is an Alumina-Silicate Clay containing Lussatite that protects the plants and fruits from heat damage (burnt leaves and fruits) caused by the concentration of UV light. Shade Advantage will be available in 50 lb. bags. 

To date we have sent samples of our proposed agricultural products to several prospective industrial and retail customers including Helena Chemical, Crop Protection Services, Brandt, Global Organics LLC, Fertizona LLC, G Farms, Massey Ag, and AG Trading Inc. in Peru. While we have not yet entered into any purchase agreements with any customer, we believe there exists a viable market for our proposed agricultural products. 

Production of the Company&#8217;s agricultural products will be dependent on the Company&#8217;s ability to extract adequate essential minerals from its existing projects or acquire such minerals from other existing sources. The Company currently obtains its humate minerals from an existing third party mine. 

Construction Sector 

It is estimated that one ton of CO 2 is released for every ton of cement manufactured. The negative external byproducts of Portland Cement production include carbon dioxide and particulate matter. The cost in the form of environmental degradation from cement production presents a global problem. As such, increasing environmental regulations will continue to add to the direct costs of concrete building materials. Pozzolan blended cements have lower CO 2 emissions than traditional Portland Cement production and reduces the overall cost of cement. The bottom line is better concrete, better price, and reduced pollution. States like California are leading the way with legislation like the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 which requires the reduction of CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. 

&#160;

Pozzolan is a siliceous and aluminous mineral which is used for a variety of purposes. As a modern cement replacement, feed supplement, absorbent and fire retardant. 

&#160;

Combinations of the economic and technical aspects and, increasingly, environmental concerns have made blended cements, i.e. cements that contain designed amounts of SCMs, a widely produced and used cement type. This presents PureBase with a unique and valuable opportunity as a "clean and green" solution provider of natural Pozzolan as an additive for cement used in all types of construction. 

Current practice may permit up to a 50% reduction of Portland cement used in the concrete mix when replaced with a carefully designed combination of approved Pozzolan. When the mix is designed properly, concrete can utilize Pozzolan without reducing the final compressive strength or other performance characteristics. The properties of hardened blended cements are strongly related to the development of the binder microstructure, i.e., to the distribution, type, shape and dimensions of both reaction products and pores. The beneficial effects of Pozzolan in terms of compressive strength performance and durability are mostly attributed to the pozzolanic reaction in which calcium hydroxide is consumed to produce additional C-S-H and C-A-H reaction products. These pozzolanic reaction products fill in pores and result in a refining of the pore size distribution or pore structure. This results in a lowered permeability of the binder and increased strength. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company believes the benefits of PureBase Pozzolan to the Cement Industry and Type 1P Pozzolan Cement include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pozzolan may constitute between 15% and 50% of the mass of Portland cement. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pozzolan may be raw or calcined. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pozzolan is environmentally friendly. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Using Pozzolan requires less electricity in the production process. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pozzolan reduces greenhouse effect. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pozzolan increases durability in harsh (i.e. seismic active) environments. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Pozzolan cement can be used in most applications including concrete paving, reinforced walls, floors, sidewalks, well-cementing, precast-pre-stressed concrete, concrete pipe, block and paver production. 

&#160; 

Pozzolan also has a cost advantage over the currently used number one and two SCM&#8217;s which are Type C &#38; F fly ash. The current cost of burned coal by-product fly ash is approximately $75/ton. We plan to produce a raw Pozzolan SCM at very competitive rates. Cartage will play a major factor in pricing, but we anticipate there will still be a substantial cost margin between fly ash and Pozzolan. 

Production of the Company&#8217;s SCM will depend on the Company&#8217;s ability to extract adequate amounts of the raw Pozzolan from its existing mining projects. 

Purebase is also developing its Distributor Program to strategically co-market and present our mutual products and services to local governments, industry and end consumers. 

Our Distributor Program will enjoy the benefits of local product labeling, co-marketing materials and reciprocal sales opportunities. The bottom line is a dynamic, fluid partnership that increases business. 

&#160;

In the future, the Company may wish to enter additional product markets which derive from natural resources such as glass, silica chips and solar panels.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company will initially rely on outside funding for these expenses. The need for external financing will be offset by revenues, as and when generated. 

Industry Overview 

&#160;

Agricultural Industry 

Agriculture and agriculture-related industries contributed $775.8 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2014, a 4.8% of GDP. The output of America&#8217;s farms contributed $166.9 billion of this sum&#8212;about 1% of GDP. In 2014, 16.5 million full- and part-time jobs were related to agriculture &#8211; about 9.2% of total U.S. employment. Direct on-farm employment provided over 2.6 million of these jobs. (Source: The US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, Agricultural Resource Management Survey Farm Financial and Crop Production survey). 

U.S. land area amounts to nearly 2.3 billion acres, with nearly 1.2 billion acres in agricultural lands. Virtually all farms today utilize various fertilizers to better utilize water resources and increase crop yields. In the US, corn crops use approximately 45% of the total available fertilizer. This is more than the combined 29% that wheat, soybeans, oilseeds, fruit and vegetables use. The remaining 26% is used by other crops. California leads the country as the largest Ag producer. In terms of sales value, California leads the country as the largest producer of agricultural products (crops and livestock), accounting for almost 11% of the national total, based on the 2012 Census of Agriculture. Iowa, Texas, Nebraska, and Minnesota round out the top five agricultural producing States, with those five representing more than a third of U.S. agricultural-output value. 

Crops account for the largest share of the value of U.S. agricultural production. The value of agricultural production in the United States has risen over the past decade due to increases in production as well as higher prices. Yield gains for crops have been particularly important, although acreage has also risen recently in response to elevated prices since 2008. Falling prices led to a slight decline in value of crop production in 2013. While livestock production increased over the decade, prices were up more than 60% between 2003 and 2013, contributing to the rising value of livestock production and its agricultural consumption. 

Climate change including increase in drought trends and an increasing population base are exacerbating the problem of adequate food production. Pesticides, GMO crops and irrigation with reclaimed water are some of the current solutions, but this is proving to be toxic to the environment, plant, animal and human health. Purebase is promoting environmental conservation through the manufacture, sale, and distribution of the highest quality industrial minerals and natural resources in the marketplace. Our plan is to create a high-quality alternative to current GMO limited use soil amendments in the world&#8217;s markets by offering a high quality water conservation product. 

Production of the Company&#8217;s agricultural products will be dependent on the Company&#8217;s ability to extract adequate essential minerals from its existing projects or acquire such minerals from other existing sources. The Company currently obtains its humate minerals from an existing third party mine. 

Construction Industry 

Concrete is a common building material consisting of water, sand, gravel (i.e. aggregate), and cement. The Economist in June 2013 estimated world cement-makers&#8217; annual revenue at $250 billion. Portland Cement is the most prevalent cementing material in the world. According to the Portland Cement Association (PCA), Long-Term Cement Consumption Outlook, the United States&#8217; cement consumption is expected to reach nearly 192 million metric tons in 2035, up from current levels of an estimated 86 million metric tons in 2014. 

Driven by healthy gains in the economy and most construction segments, cement use is expected to grow 7.5% in 2016, according to the latest PCA forecast. The USA is the world&#8217;s 3rd largest producer of Cement. The increase will bring U.S. cement volume to approximately 103.2 million tons in 2016. Of the 50 US states, the top 3 cement producers in descending order by volume are Texas, California and Missouri. Long-term demand considerations must 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

be weighed against supply conditions. Climate change legislation is likely to result in the elimination of wet process cement production. The National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) could force the closure of a further significant portion of domestic cement capacity due to pollution concerns. This uncertain regulatory environment will likely cause a temporary hiatus in plant expansions once existing expansion plans are completed. 

Competition 

Major competitors in the Soil Amendments Industry include: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Tiger-sul: Tiger-sul is a manufacturer of bentonite sulphur and bentonite micronutrients technology. They manufacture products for the Agricultural, Organic &#38; Turf markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Heart of Nature: Heart of Nature provides natural &#8220;ph reducing&#8221; sulfur products to farmers that help their crops to uptake water and nutrients more efficiently. Heart of Nature is located adjacent to the USMC mine site. This company is currently producing in the range of 1,500 tons per month. 

Major competitors in the Cement Additive Industry include: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Headwaters Resources: Headwaters Incorporated (Headwaters) is a diversified company providing products, technologies and services in three industries: building products, coal combustion products (CCPs) and energy. The largest ash management company in the US, Headwaters markets nearly 20 million tons of fly ash annually from 30 states. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Boral: Boral Limited is Australia&#8217;s largest building and construction materials supplier and has significant operations in the USA and in Asia. With approximately $5 billion worth of sales, Boral has over 15,900 employees working across 717 operating sites. The US operations include the country&#8217;s largest brick manufacturer, the largest clay tile manufacturer, one of the largest fly ash suppliers, and the group holds a strong position in the Denver construction materials market and more recently in Oklahoma construction materials. Boral Materials Technologies has approximately 40 locations around the country including operations at electrical utility plants, fly ash terminals and sales offices marketing approximately 4 million tons of fly ash annually. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Salt River Materials Group: SRM, which is the marketing arm of Phoenix Cement is a leading supplier of Portland and masonry cements, fly ash and other Pozzolan SCMs, both normal and light weight aggregates, and natural gypsum products throughout Arizona and the Southwestern United States. SRM manages approximately 500,000 tons of fly ash annually. 

&#160;

Pricing Competition 

The cement additive sector relies heavily on the construction industry. Increased construction activity ultimately decreases the amount of available competitive products, particularly fly ash. Reduced availability of competitive products results in increased costs making our natural Pozzolan more attractive to prospective customers. 

&#8195; 

The Top 3 buying criteria for SCMs are: 

1. Product quality 

2. Price with product proximity (i.e. cartage / delivery) as a principle factor in price 

3. Service and support 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Many of our competitors have greater exploration, production, and capital resources than we do, and may be able to compete more effectively in any of these areas. For example, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisition of desirable mineral properties, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance the exploration and development of their mineral properties. Our inability to secure capital to fund exploration and, if warranted, development costs for our mineral properties would create a competitive cost disadvantage in the marketplace which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and potential profitability. 

We also compete in the hiring and retention of key executives, skilled laborers, experienced subcontractors and other employees and contract personnel. Consequently, though unlikely, it is possible that we may not be able to hire or retain qualified geologists, exploration personnel or equipment operators in the numbers or at the times desired. 

Employees 

As of November 30, 2015, we had four full-time employees and two consultants. Employees include a CEO, a CFO, a General Counsel, and a Vice President of Agricultural Research and Development. We anticipate hiring additional employees during the current year to work the Company's mining sites as our exploration and development programs commence. While skilled equipment and operations personnel are in demand, we believe we will be able to hire the necessary workers to sustain our current exploration and development programs. Our employees are not expected to be subject to a labor contract or collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

Consulting services, relating primarily to agricultural market research and product development, and relating to the development and application of SCMs, as well as other technical matters as may be deemed useful in the product development and branding activities, will be provided by independent contractors. 

Government Controls and Regulations 

Natural resource exploration, mining and processing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing prospecting, exploration, development, production, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, control of toxic substances, and other matters involving environmental protection and employment. United States environmental protection laws address the maintenance of air and water quality standards, the preservation of threatened and endangered species of wildlife and vegetation, the preservation of certain archaeological sites, reclamation, and limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, among other things. There can be no assurance that all the required permits and governmental approvals necessary for any mining project with which we may be associated can be obtained on a timely basis, or maintained in good standing. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain necessary government permits and approvals may adversely impact our operations. The regulatory environment in which we operate could change in ways that would substantially increase costs to achieve compliance. In addition, significant changes in regulation could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to timely and effectively implement our drilling/mapping programs and develop our mining properties. 

Outlined below are some of the more significant aspects of governmental controls and regulations which materially affect the mining properties we will seek to explore. 

Federal Regulation of Mining Activity 

Mining activities, including drilling, mapping and development and production activities are subject to environmental laws, policies and regulations. These laws, policies and regulations affect, among other matters, emissions to the air, discharges to water, management of waste, management of hazardous substances, protection of natural resources, protection of endangered species, protection of antiquities and reclamation of mined land. Mining properties are also subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws and regulations. At the federal level, mining properties are subject to inspection and regulation by the Division of Mine Safety and Health Administration 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

of the Department of Labor (&#8220;MSHA&#8221;) under provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The Occupation and Safety Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) also has jurisdiction over certain safety and health standards not covered by MSHA. Mining operations and all proposed exploration and development will require a variety of permits. In addition, any mining operations occurring on federal property are subject to regulation and inspection by the Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;). While we have considerable experience in the mining permitting process, permitting procedures are complex, costly, time consuming and subject to potential regulatory delay. We currently own mining rights in several properties having existing permits in place or properties where existing permitting requirements and other applicable environmental protection laws and regulations would not pose a material hindrance to our ability to explore and develop such properties. As part of our initial evaluation of suitable projects, we will ascertain a property&#8217;s regulatory compliance status and any issues affecting current or future permitting requirements. However, we cannot be certain that future changes in laws and regulations would not result in significant additional expenses, capital expenditures, restrictions or delays associated with the exploration and development of our current or future projects. We cannot predict whether we will be able to obtain new permits or whether material changes in permit conditions will be imposed. Obtaining new mining permits or the imposition of additional conditions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop the mining properties in which we have an interest or ownership. 

Legislation has been introduced in prior sessions of the U.S. Congress to make significant revisions to the U.S. General Mining Law of 1872 that would affect our potential development of unpatented mining claims on federal lands, including any royalty on mineral production. It cannot be predicted whether any of these proposals will become law. Any levy of the type proposed would only apply to unpatented federal lands and accordingly could adversely affect the profitability of any future mineral production from projects being explored by the Company on federal property.

All of our current mining projects will be governed by the Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (1976) established the BLM&#8217;s multiple-use mandate to manage the public lands &#8220;in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archeological values; that, where appropriate, will preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition&#8221;. The Lands, Minerals &#38; Water Rights branch coordinates with BLM planning and resource specialists to manage surface resources, minerals and water rights to ensure that authorized uses of public lands do nothing to diminish their health and productivity or impair their use and enjoyment by present and future generations. 

&#160;

In connection with exploring, mining, and milling activities, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. 

&#160;

With respect to the permits required for our projects mentioned above, we may be unable to obtain such permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving such permits, our timetable and business plan for development and mining of these properties could be adversely affected. See Item1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for more information.

Environmental Regulations 

Legislation and implementation of regulations adopted or proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), the BLM and by comparable agencies in various states, directly and indirectly affect the mining industry in the United States. These laws and regulations address the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing, including potential contamination of soil and water from tailings, discharges and other wastes generated by mining process. In particular, legislation such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), and the National Environmental Policy Act require analysis and/or impose effluent standards, new source performance standards, air quality standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of mining and mineral processing, including natural resource mining and processing of the type to be conducted by the Company. Such statutes also may impose liability on mine developers for remediation of waste they have created. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Mining projects also are subject to regulations under (i) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA" or &#8220;Superfund&#8221;) which regulates and establishes liability for the release of hazardous substances and (ii) the Endangered Species Act (&#8220;ESA&#8221;) which identifies endangered species of plants and animals and regulates activities to protect these species and their habitats. Revisions to &#8220;CERCLA&#8221; and &#8220;ESA&#8221; are being considered by Congress; however, the impact of these potential revisions on our business is not clear at this time. 

The Clean Air Act, as amended, mandates the establishment of a Federal air permitting program, identifies a list of hazardous air pollutants, including various metals and pollutants, and establishes new enforcement authority. The EPA has published final regulations establishing the minimum elements of state operating permit programs. We will be required to comply with these EPA standards to the extent adopted by the State in which development projects are located. 

In addition, developing mining sites requires mitigation of long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, resloping, and revegetating various portions of a site. While a portion of the required work can be performed concurrently with developing the property, completion of the environmental mitigation occurs once removal of all materials and facilities has been completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with detailed plans which have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. The mining developer must insure that all necessary cash deposits and provision to cover the estimated costs of such reclamation as required by permit are made. 

Any exploration and development of mining projects by the Company will be conducted in substantial compliance with federal and state regulations and be consistent with the need to remediate any environmental impact.
