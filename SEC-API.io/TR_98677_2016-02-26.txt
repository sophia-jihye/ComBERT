Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) have been engaged in the manufacture and sale of confectionery products for over 100 years. This is the only industry segment in which the Company operates and is its only line of business. The majority of the Company&#8217;s products are sold under the registered trademarks TOOTSIE ROLL, TOOTSIE POPS, CHILD&#8217;S PLAY, CARAMEL APPLE POPS, CHARMS, BLOW-POP, CHARMS MINI POPS, CELLA&#8217;S, DOTS, JUNIOR MINTS, CHARLESTON CHEW, SUGAR DADDY, SUGAR BABIES, ANDES, FLUFFY STUFF, DUBBLE BUBBLE, RAZZLES, CRY BABY, NIK-L-NIP, and TUTSI POP (Mexico). 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s products are marketed in a variety of packages designed to be suitable for display and sale in different types of retail outlets. They are sold through approximately 30 candy and grocery brokers and by the Company itself to approximately 4,000 customers throughout the United States. These customers include wholesale distributors of candy and groceries, supermarkets, variety stores, dollar stores, chain grocers, drug chains, discount chains, cooperative grocery associations, mass merchandisers, warehouse and membership club stores, vending machine operators, the U.S. military and fund-raising charitable organizations. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s principal markets are in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The majority of production from the Company&#8217;s Canadian plants is sold in the United States. The majority of production from the Company&#8217;s Mexican plant is sold in Mexico. 

&#160; 

The domestic confectionery business is highly competitive. The Company competes primarily with other manufacturers of confectionery products sold to the above mentioned customers. Although accurate statistics are not available, the Company believes it is among the ten largest domestic manufacturers in this field. In the markets in which the Company competes, the main forms of competition comprise brand recognition, as well as competition for retail shelf space and a fair price for the Company&#8217;s products at various retail price points. 

&#160; 

The Company did not have a material backlog of firm orders at the end of the calendar years 2015 or 2014. 

&#160; 

Although the Company experienced moderating costs for some ingredients in 2015 compared to 2014, unit costs for certain ingredients and packaging materials were higher in 2015 compared to 2014, and the Company expects higher ingredient costs in 2016. The Company has made progress toward restoring margins to their historical levels before the increases in commodity and other input costs in past years. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company has historically hedged certain of its future sugar, corn syrup and soybean oil needs with derivatives at such times that it believes that the forward markets are favorable. The Company&#8217;s decision to hedge its major ingredient requirements is dependent on the Company&#8217;s evaluation of forward commodity markets and comparison to vendor quotations, if available, and/or historical costs. The Company has historically hedged these major commodities and ingredients with derivatives, primarily commodity futures and option contracts, before the commencement of the next calendar year to better ascertain the need for product pricing changes or product weight decline (indirect price change) adjustments to its product sales portfolio and better manage ingredient costs. The Company will generally purchase forward derivative contracts (i.e., &#8220;long&#8221; position) in selected future months that correspond to the Company&#8217;s estimated procurement and usage needs of the respective commodity in the respective forward periods. 

&#160; 

From time to time, the Company also changes the size of certain of its products, which are usually sold at standard prices, in response to significant changes in ingredient and other input costs. 

&#160; 

The Company does not hold any material patents, licenses, franchises or concessions. The Company&#8217;s major trademarks are registered in the United States and in many other countries. Continued trademark protection is of material importance to the Company&#8217;s business as a whole. 

&#160; 

Although the Company does research and develops new products and product line extensions for existing brands, it also improves the quality of existing products, improves and modernizes production processes, and develops and implements new technologies to enhance the quality and reduce the costs of products. The Company does not expend material amounts of money on research or development activities. 

&#160; 

The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the United States, the Company&#8217;s activities are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Similar agencies also regulate the businesses outside of the United States. The Company maintains quality assurance and other programs to insure that all products the Company manufacture s and distribute s are safe and of high quality and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s compliance with federal, state and local regulations which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company nor does the Company anticipate any such material effects from presently enacted or adopted regulations. 

&#160; 

The Company employs approximately 2,000 persons. 

&#160; 

The Company has found that its sales normally maintain a consistent level throughout the year except for a substantial increase in the third quarter which reflects pre-Halloween and back-to-school sales. In anticipation of this high sales period, the Company generally begins building inventories in the second quarter of each year. The Company historically offers extended credit terms for sales made under seasonal sales programs, including Halloween. Each year, after accounts receivables related to third quarter sales have been collected, the Company invests such funds in various marketable securities. 

&#160; 

Sales revenues from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. aggregated approximately 23.7%, 23.7%, and 23.8% of net product sales during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Some of the aforementioned sales to Wal-Mart are sold to McLane Company, a large national grocery wholesaler, which services and delivers certain of the Company products to Wal-Mart and other retailers in the U.S.A. Net product sales revenues from McLane, which includes these Wal-Mart sales as well as sales and deliveries to other Company customers, were 16.7% in 2015 and 15.3% in 2014 and 15.1% in 2013. Although no customer other than McLane Company, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for more than 10% of net product sales, the loss of one or more significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business.
