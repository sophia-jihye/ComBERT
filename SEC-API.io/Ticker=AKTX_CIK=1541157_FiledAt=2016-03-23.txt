 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Akari Therapeutics, Plc (&#8220;Akari&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), formerly Celsus Therapeutics, Plc (&#8220;Celsus&#8221;), is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming treatments for a range of rare and orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases caused by dysregulation of complement C5, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), Guillain Barr&#233; syndrome (GBS) and atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS).

&#160;

On September 18, 2015, Celsus completed its acquisition of all of the capital stock of Volution Immuno Pharmaceuticals SA (&#8220;Volution&#8221;), from ` Pharma Limited (&#8220;RPC&#8221;), Volution&#8217;s sole shareholder, in exchange for ordinary shares, par value &#163;0.01, (&#8220;Ordinary Shares&#8221;), of Celsus (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;), in accordance with the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of July 10, 2015 (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;), by and among Celsus and RPC. In connection with the Acquisition, the name of the combined company was changed to Akari Therapeutics, Plc. The Company&#8217;s American Depositary Shares (&#8220;ADSs&#8221;), each representing 100 Ordinary Shares, began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;AKTX&#8221; on September 21, 2015.

&#160;

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics to treat rare and orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our lead drug, Coversin, a second-generation and potentially best-in-class complement inhibitor, acts on complement component-C5, preventing release of C5a and formation of C5b &#8211; 9 (also known as the membrane attack complex or MAC). Coversin is a recombinant small protein (16,740 Da) derived from a protein discovered in the saliva of the Ornithodoros moubata tick, where it modulates the host immune system to allow the parasite to feed without alerting the host to its presence or provoking an immune response.

&#160;

C5 inhibition is a new form of treatment that was commercially pioneered by Alexion Pharmaceuticals in 2007 (Nasdaq: ALXN) with FDA approval of their drug Soliris&#174; (eculizumab) to treat PNH. Soliris&#174; is currently the only drug approved to treat two complement-related orphan indications, PNH and aHUS, and has annual sales of $2.6 billion. Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, administered by twice monthly intravenous infusion (IV).

&#160;

To date, we have demonstrated: (i) 100% inhibition of complement C5 activity by Coversin within 12 hours in a Phase Ia clinical trial in healthy volunteers; (ii) that Coversin inhibits PNH red blood cell lysis in vitro (iii) that Coversin can achieve full complement inhibition in the blood of eculizumab-resistant patients tested to date and (iv) that complement inhibition is complete whether measured by Elisa CH50 U Eq/ml assay or sheep red blood cell lytic CH50 assay, as demonstrated in our 28-day safety study in non-human primates (NHP) where Coversin was dosed once a day for 28 days. We believe that the subcutaneous formulation of Coversin will provide considerable patient benefits, accelerating recruitment for trials, and patient uptake if Coversin is approved by regulatory authorities for commercial sale.

&#160;

Scientific understanding of the role of complement C5 inhibition in the treatment of a range of rare diseases related to uncontrolled activation of the complement arm of the immune system is growing. These rare diseases include conditions such as PNH, aHUS, myasthenia gravis (MG), GBS, and Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Complement System 

&#160;

In mammals, including humans, the immune system exists primarily to protect the body from invasion by harmful microbes and parasites. In humans, it is divided into the innate immune system, nonspecific defense mechanisms that come into play immediately or within hours of an antigen&#8217;s appearance in the body, and the adaptive immune system, which develops after birth in response to exposure to foreign antigens. The adaptive immune system mounts attacks against organisms to which the host has previously been exposed, principally through production of antibodies and T-cells. The complement system (see figure 1, below), in evolutionary terms one of the oldest parts of the immune system, is considered to bridge the divide between innate and adaptive immunity, working with the immune system to disable and clear out foreign invaders and unwanted cells. It acts by triggering one or all of three processes: inflammation, thrombosis or cell destruction by lysis. Together with white blood cells and antibodies, it marks organisms recognized as pathogenic for destruction, and then assists in this process by signaling for the appropriate white cells and mounting a direct lytic (destructive) attack on foreign cells.

&#160;

Another important function of the complement system is the recognition of dead and dying host cells, marking them for removal by phagocytes. When activated, the complement system produces a cascade of proteins. C5, near the end of the complement cascade, is then split into the anaphylatoxin C5a, a powerful inflammatory substance in its own right, and into C5b, necessary for the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is responsible for much of the tissue damage in many autoimmune diseases. Although both C5a and the MAC provide useful protection against microbial infection when produced in appropriate circumstances, their unregulated release may lead to life-threatening inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Coversin binds to the complement C5 molecule to prevent it splitting into complement C5a and C5b. The coversin molecule also has a binding site for the pro-inflammatory cytokine leukotriene B4 (LTB4). This confers additional anti-leukocyte properties and may contribute to additional efficacy in conditions in which trafficking of neutrophils and eosinophils play a role. Although not immediate targets for the Company such diseases include asthma, COPD, other respiratory inflammatory diseases, and other disorders where neutrophil or eosinophil infiltration play and important role.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Complement C3 and C5 are produced continuously by organs such as the liver and by cells such as macrophages to act as raw material to &#8220;prime the pump&#8221; should the complement system be called into action. Once activated, the whole complement cascade runs automatically until the potential threat is eliminated by one of the immune mechanisms. To prevent it running out of control, the complement system also includes a number of regulator, or inhibitor, proteins and it is usually when these proteins are deficient for genetic or other reasons that the complement system becomes dysregulated, and may start to directly attack the body&#8217;s own healthy organs and tissues. In other circumstances, the complement system may run out of control in response to a relatively mild infection which results in a &#8220;cytokine storm&#8221; in which an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction or thrombotic event endangers the body&#8217;s own survival. Until the relatively recent discovery and regulatory approval of clinical complement inhibitors (such as eculizumab), doctors were able to offer little effective treatment for such life-threatening events.

&#160;

There are known pathological consequences of total terminal complement inhibition. These are well-understood both through study of people with a congenital genetic total C5 deficiency, and via careful follow-up of patients receiving eculizumab, some of whom have been terminally complement suppressed for more than nine years. It has been found that the most serious consequence of terminal complement inhibition is an increased tendency to meningitis caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacterium. As a result of this discovery, all patients receiving eculizumab are carefully monitored and given either or both meningitis immunisation and prophylactic antibiotics. We expect that this precaution will also apply to patients treated with Coversin.

&#160;

While it is possible to target other components of the complement system, like C3, it remains unclear if these targets will be safe or effective. C3, for example, plays a larger role in the complement system than C5, in that it not only leads eventually to the activation of C5, but is also involved in opsonization and removal of senescent cells as well as other immune functions. Unlike patients with inherited C5 deficiency, where the greatest risk is from Neisseria infections, which can be guarded against with a meningitis vaccine, C3 inhibition may carry a more significant risk since individuals with congenital C3 deficiencies suffer from generalised infections and other developmental abnormalities, rarely surviving beyond early childhood if untreated.

&#160; 

Lead Drug Candidate &#8212; Coversin 

&#160;

Our lead drug, Coversin, a second-generation and potentially best-in-class complement inhibitor, acts on complement C5, preventing release of C5a and formation of C5b-9 (also known as the membrane attack complex or MAC). Coversin is a recombinant small protein (16,740 Da) derived from a protein discovered in the saliva of the Ornithodoros moubata tick, where it modulates the host immune system to allow the parasite to feed without alerting the host to its presence or provoking an immune response.

&#160;

To date, we have demonstrated: (i) 100% inhibition of complement C5 activity by Coversin within 12 hours in a Phase Ia clinical trial in healthy volunteers; (ii) that Coversin inhibits PNH red blood cell lysis in vitro (iii) that Coversin can achieve full complement inhibition in the blood of eculizumab-resistant patients tested to date and (iv) that complement inhibition is complete whether measured by Elisa CH50 U Eq/ml assay or sheep red blood cell lytic CH50 assay, as demonstrated in our 28-day safety study in NHP where Coversin was dosed once a day for 28 days. We believe that the subcutaneous formulation of Coversin will provide considerable patient benefits, accelerating recruitment for trials, and patient uptake if Coversin is approved by regulatory authorities for commercial sale.

&#160;

Although the precise binding site is different, Coversin acts on C5 in broadly the same way as eculizumab, inhibiting C5 activation and release of C5a and the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). As Coversin is active across mammalian species, we have been able to carry out numerous pre-clinical experiments, demonstrating activity in a broad range of complement mediated diseases.

&#160;

Clinical Development Program &#8212; Past and Future 

&#160;

The role of complement dysregulation in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is becoming increasingly recognized. From a handful of diseases known to be associated with disorders of the complement system thirty years ago, there are now more than 80 described in medical literature. Our future development strategy for Coversin will likely be dependent on a number of factors, including commercial considerations, availability of clinical material, support from key opinion leaders for development targeting specific indications, and human and other resources. It is likely that our chief focus will be on rare and orphan diseases, including disease states spanning hematology, nephrology, transplantation, neurology and ophthalmology.

&#160;

Coversin entered clinical development in 2013 when a Phase Ia clinical trial was initiated under a Clinical Trials Authorisation (CTA) issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an executive agency of the Department of Health in the United Kingdom. The primary objective of this single ascending dose, first-in-man study was to explore the safety profile of Coversin. The drug was well tolerated, and no serious or dose-related adverse events were reported. The secondary objective of this Phase Ia clinical trial was to examine the effect of Coversin on complement activity at the highest, therapeutic dose. This showed that the peak onset of action was about nine hours after injection, and that the effect of a single dose persisted for more than 96 hours. The effects were consistent between all subjects and showed 100% inhibition of the complement system (see Phase Ia trial results, at right) within 12 hours. This trial suggested that Coversin is suitable for once daily subcutaneous injection. Confirmation of this and of the optimal repeat dose are expected to be obtained in a Phase Ib repeat dose study which was initiated in the first quarter of 2016.

&#160;

&#160;

Our initial clinical targets will be PNH, GBS, aHUS, and the treatment of patients with polymorphisms of the C5 molecule which interfere with correct binding of eculizumab, making them resistant to treatment with that drug. The latter are expected to be initially treated under compassionate use and named patient protocols until sufficient safety and efficacy data have been accumulated to allow for regulatory approval.

&#160;

We have initiated treatment in a European patient with PNH and resistant to eculizumab due to a polymorphism on February 8, 2016. The patient is being treated with Coversin under a clinical trial protocol approved by an EU national regulatory authority for treating patients with eculizumab resistance. The primary objective of the eculizumab-resistance program is to provide patients who have clinically demonstrated resistance to eculizumab early access to Coversin as a potentially lifesaving alternative. These patients are entered into an open label protocol where safety and efficacy are measured on an ongoing basis. We expect to present topline results from these patients as they become available. A Phase Ib clinical trial in healthy volunteers was initiated in January 2016, and we expect to initiate a Phase II trial in PNH patients in the second quarter of 2016. We expect to start a Phase II trial in GBS in the middle of 2016 and in aHUS in late 2016. We expect data from the Phase II trial in PNH to be available by year-end 2016. If Coversin achieves satisfactory results in those Phase II clinical trials, we expect to immediately proceed into Phase III pivotal studies in both Europe and the United States.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Coversin, at 17 kDa, is much smaller than typical antibodies currently used in therapeutic treatment. Coversin can be self-administered by subcutaneous injection, much like an insulin injection, which the Company believes will provide considerable benefits in terms of patient convenience. Use of fixed dose regimens and a dry powder formulation will further increase patient comfort and convenience, and patient surveys suggest that a majority of patients would prefer to self-inject daily than undergo intravenous infusions. Coversin&#8217;s small physical size allows it to be potentially used in a variety of formulations, some of which may enable therapeutic use via topical or inhaled routes of administration.

&#160;

Toxicology 

&#160;

We successfully completed short-term toxicology trials of Coversin in rats and cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 100 times the highest expected human dose, a 28-day NHP study, and a one month and three month rodent study. No evidence of any harmful reaction or laboratory findings outside the generally-accepted normal range was found. These toxicology studies were used as a basis to gain regulatory authorization for Coversin&#8217;s Phase 1a clinical trial in 2014, and also supported the five day repeat-dose Phase Ib trial initiate on January 29, 2016, and will support the Phase II clinical trial which we expect to initiate in the second quarter of 2016.

&#160;

With our toxicology studies showing no signs of harmful reactions or laboratory findings outside the generally-accepted normal range, we expect the UK regulatory authorities (MHRA) to require only a single animal species (mouse) sufficient for long term toxicology studies of up to six months to support eventual marketing authorization in humans.

&#160;

Certain specialized forms of toxicology studies, including both carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicology studies, will also be necessary before marketing authorization. These are normally performed in mice, and we expect to complete these additional toxicology studies concurrently with planned Phase II and Phase III clinical trials.

&#160;

Immunogenicity 

&#160;

We successfully completed a chronic (28 day) dosing experiment in mice to investigate whether daily subcutaneous administration of the expected therapeutic dose of Coversin induces an antibody response, and whether the antibodies neutralise complement inhibition by Coversin. The data from this chronic dosing experiment showed Coversin was well tolerated with no injection site allergic reactions or behavioral changes. Coversin can induce formation of low titre anti-drug IgG antibodies in mice after four weeks of daily inoculation, which is not uncommon, but these antibodies were not neutralising and had no effect on Coversin&#8217;s ability to inhibit complement.

&#160;

We believe these data support the development of Coversin for chronic use in humans. During the upcoming Phase Ib and Phase II clinical trials and chronic toxicology studies, we plan to concurrently investigate whether any antibodies arise to Coversin, and if they do, whether these antibodies affect the drug&#8217;s activity or clearance rates and consequently drug tolerance and efficacy of the drug.

&#160;

Metabolic studies 

&#160;

Metabolic studies, also known as ADME (administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion), are routinely undertaken in the development of any new drug. We have carried out a comprehensive program of such studies with Coversin in animals and as part of its Phase Ia and Ib trials and have gained a good insight into the behavior of the molecule.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

When administered intravenously, Coversin is immediately available to bind complement C5, which circulates continuously in the bloodstream. Any Coversin that remains unbound is rapidly filtered and excreted by the kidney with a circulating half-life of approximately 30 minutes. Coversin is uniformly distributed through most blood-perfused tissues of the body, but does not cross the intact blood brain barrier into the central nervous system. If given in excess, Coversin will ablate all circulating C5, as was demonstrated in the Company&#8217;s Phase Ia trial. Complete ablation results in reduction of terminal complement activity to zero until it is replenished by natural production, chiefly by the liver and macrophages. In our Phase Ia trial, 100% C5 inhibition was achieved in 12 hours, and did not return to baseline for four days.

&#160;

Target Indications 

&#160;

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 

&#160;

PNH is an ultra-rare, life-threatening and debilitating disease of the blood with an estimated 8,000 &#8211; 10,000 patients across North America and Europe. Due to an acquired genetic deficiency, uncontrolled complement activation in PNH patients allows their own complement system to attack and destroy blood cells, leading to life-threatening complications.

&#160;

Patients with PNH suffer from chronic complement activation and destruction of some of their blood cells, known as hemolysis, caused by the C5 cleavage product C5b-9 (the membrane attack complex). This hemolysis is associated with further clinical symptoms and negative outcomes, including kidney disease, thrombosis (blood clots), liver dysfunction, fatigue, impaired quality of life, recurring pain, shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension, intermittent episodes of dark-colored urine (hemoglobinuria), and anemia. When the destruction of red blood cells is sufficiently large, recurrent blood transfusions may be necessary.

&#160;

Before the introduction of eculizumab, PNH patients, many of whom were in young adulthood, faced a life of repeated blood transfusions, thromboembolic complications and typical life expectancies of only 8 &#8211; 10 years from diagnosis. There are no animal models of the autoimmune hematological condition paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). The advent of eculizumab, the first effective complement C5 inhibitor, transformed this bleak outlook, and most of these patients now enjoy a more normal life expectancy.

&#160;

Eculizumab resistance 

&#160;

Coversin and eculizumab both prevent the splitting of complement C5 into its active components, but they each accomplish this effect by binding to specific and different sites on the molecule. It has recently been discovered that a small but identifiable subgroup of eculizumab-treated patients have a C5 polymorphism affecting the eculizumab binding site which prevents correct binding and makes these patients resistant to treatment &#8212; but does not appear to affect binding by Coversin in those patients tested to date. While this polymorphism has been identified in 3.5% of the Japanese population, the prevalence of this and other potential mutations that may interfere with eculizumab binding activity in non-Japanese patients remains unknown.

&#160;

A currently available blood test enables some of these eculizumab-resistant patients to be identified, we are in discussions with regulatory authorities to allow treatment of patients with Coversin under compassionate or named-patient protocols, as there are no alternate treatments currently available. We have identified several non-Japanese patients to date and have demonstrated that Coversin fully inhibits complement activity in the blood of these patients by blocking C5. As noted above, we have also initiated treatment of a patient with PNH and eculizumab resistance due to a C5 polymorphism.

&#160;

Guillain Barr&#233; syndrome 

&#160;

Guillain Barr&#233; syndrome is an acute immune-mediated polyneuropathy where the immune system is triggered into attacking the myelin sheath surrounding nerves, leading to progressive, fairly symmetric muscle weakness accompanied by absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes. Patients usually present a few days to a week after onset of symptoms. The weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremities, facial, respiratory, and bulbar muscles.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome occurs worldwide, with an overall incidence of one to two per 100,000 per year. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, there are over 6,000 patients admitted to US hospitals with a primary diagnosis of GBS every year. While all age groups are affected, the incidence increases by approximately 20% with every ten-year increase in age beyond the first decade of life. Patients are treated with supportive care, plasma exchange or Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG).

&#160;

The proportion of patients with GBS who walk independently at six months and one year after diagnosis is approximately 80% and 84%, respectively. At one year, full recovery of motor strength occurs in about 60% of patients, while severe motor problems persist in about 14%. Approximately 5 to 10% of patients with GBS have a prolonged course with several months of ventilator dependency and very delayed and incomplete recovery. Within one year of diagnosis, approximately 4 to 5% of patients with GBS die despite intensive care. Of patients who become ventilator dependent, about 20% will die.

&#160;

Causes of death include acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, pulmonary emboli, and unexplained cardiac arrest. In an in vitro model of GBS, Coversin was shown to prevent the development of the characteristic pathological markers of disease activity, and in vivo protected mice from developing respiratory paralysis, the most serious consequence of GBS in humans.

&#160;

Coversin has been successfully tested in animal models of Guillain Barr&#233; syndrome (GBS). In GBS, complement-mediated damage is provoked by the deposition of auto-antibodies, against the neuromuscular junction in the myelin sheath. This in turn triggers systemic complement activation and local tissue destruction, with often devastating neurological consequences.

&#160;

Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) 

&#160;

Complement-mediated &#8216;atypical&#8217; hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a chronic and life-threatening ultra-rare genetic disease with an estimated prevalence of seven per one million individuals in which uncontrolled complement activation causes blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), leading to kidney failure, stroke, heart attack and death.

&#160;

The prognosis for patients with aHUS is generally poor. Approximately 70% of patients with the most common mutation experience chronic renal insufficiency, chronic dialysis, or death by one year after the first clinical symptoms. aHUS commonly recurs in patients who undergo renal transplantation for the kidney injury and kidney failure suffered due to the uncontrolled complement activity. Approximately 50% of patients with aHUS have been identified to have genetic mutations in at least one of the complement control proteins or neutralizing autoantibodies to complement regulatory factors, which can lead to uncontrolled complement activation. Eculizumab received accelerated FDA approval in 2011 based on data from both prospective and retrospective trials in a cumulative total of 67 adult and pediatric patients.

&#160;

Eculizumab remains the first and only therapy approved for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with aHUS. Alexion, the maker of eculizumab, has noted that the opportunity for eculizumab in aHUS is at least as large as PNH, with more patients in the United States receiving eculizumab for aHUS than PNH at a similar timeframe from launch since its approval in aHUS. Given that eculizumab and Coversin have the same mode of action, it is anticipated that Coversin will be effective in treating aHUS patients.

&#160;

Sjogren&#8217;s-related dry eye syndrome 

&#160;

Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome is a chronic multisystem inflammatory autoimmune disorder characterized by a combination of dry eyes and dry mouth. According to medical literature, it is estimated that the annual incidence of Sjogren&#8217;s may range between four to as high as 43 per 100,000 people, with approximately 5% of these patients having severe dry eye. Severe dry eye is a painful and debilitating symptom that can lead to blindness. There is evidence that Coversin has activity against eye surface inflammation. Delivery by the topical ocular route, made possible by Coversin&#8217;s small molecular size, has considerable advantages both in reducing the total quantity of drug needed and, because the very small topical dose, virtually abolishes the effects of systemic complement inhibition, in reducing the risk of meningitis infection or need for prophylaxis of potential Neisseria infections.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome, a complement driven autoimmune disease affects multiple organs including the eye where it is responsible for a very severe form of dry eye which can be sight threatening. It is estimated that dry eye disease generally affects approximately 8% of the population, mainly women, and in 11% of these it is a co-morbidity of Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome. Thus approximately 2.5 million people in the United States suffer from ocular Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome. The only approved drug for dry eye (but not Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome), cyclosporine, is of limited efficacy against ocular Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome.

&#160;

Coversin&#8217;s special physical characteristics make it an attractive candidate drug for the treatment of ocular Sj&#246;gren&#8217;s syndrome which is not accessible by this route to antibodies like eculizumab or gene therapies which require systemic complement inhibition. Relative to systemic diseases such as PNH and aHUS, ocular drug development is potentially rapid and new drugs typically gain marketing approval much sooner than their systemic counterparts. Coversin has already successfully completed a 60 day topical eye toxicology study and is in a position to enter eye clinical trials in the near future.

&#160;

Market Opportunity in Complement Mediated Diseases 

&#160;

The NIH estimates that approximately 23.5 million Americans may suffer from an autoimmune disorder, although this number may underestimate actual prevalence as it includes only 24 diseases for which good epidemiology studies were available. Researchers have identified 80 &#8211; 100 different autoimmune diseases and suspect at least 40 additional diseases of having an autoimmune basis. These diseases are chronic and can be life-threatening. Autoimmune disease is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in female children and women in all age groups up to 64 years of age. The NIH estimates annual direct health care costs for autoimmune diseases to be in the range of $100 billion. As noted earlier, the complement system works with the immune system to disable and clear out foreign invaders and unwanted cells, and as such, plays an important role in the pathology of many autoimmune diseases. The term &#8220;Complement Mediated Diseases&#8221; applies to diseases and conditions where a patient&#8217;s immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake, causing damage through its complement component and through mediators induced by complement activation. These diseases and conditions are often very rare, and include such diseases as PNH, aHUS, Myasthenia Gravis, GBS, transplant mediated organ rejection, glomerulopathies (kidney diseases), as well as numerous other disorders. While not all complement mediated diseases will respond to a direct C5 inhibitor, like Coversin, there is a large market opportunity as demonstrated by eculizumab with $2.6 billion in sales in 2015, with expectation of continued growth to its two approved indications of PNH and aHUS due to many other additional indications in current preclinical and clinical development.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We will face competition with respect to all product candidates that we may develop or commercialize in the future from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. The key factors affecting the success of any approved product will be its efficacy, safety profile, drug interactions, method of administration, pricing, reimbursement and level of promotional activity relative to those of competing drugs.

&#160;

Our potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, and personnel resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on its ability to leverage its collective experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization to:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; discover and develop medicines that are differentiated from other products in the market, including eculizumab; &#160; &#8226; obtain patent and/or proprietary protection for our medicines and technologies; &#160; &#8226; obtain required regulatory approvals; &#160; &#8226; obtain a commercial partner; &#160; &#8226; commercialize its drugs, if approved; and &#160; &#8226; attract and retain high-quality research, development and commercial personnel. &#160; 

Coversin . If approved, we would expect Coversin to compete in the market for PNH and aHUS treatment with eculizumab, which was developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Eculizumab is the first and only therapy approved for PNH, is marketed by Alexion and had sales of approximately $2.6 billion in 2015. Clinicians, nurses and patient groups contacted by the Company believe that the ability to self-administer Coversin as a fixed-dose daily subcutaneous injection will be an attractive alternative therapy.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

There has been a broad research effort in complement based therapy to date, with eculizumab being the first and only therapy approved that directly inhibits C5. We believe that Coversin is amongst the most advanced in clinical development of next generation C5 inhibitors. However, we are aware of certain other companies and academic institutions that are continuing their efforts to discover and develop alternate complement and/or C5 inhibitors, including Alexion, Alnylam, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum and RA Pharmaceuticals.

&#160;

We are aware of certain other companies that are focused on developing therapies targeting other aspects of the complement system, including Appelis, Amyndus, Achillion, Omeros, Chemocentryx and True North Therapeutics.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

Because we are focused on discovery and development of drugs, we currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities in order to commercialize Coversin or any approved drug candidates. If our product candidate Coversin is approved, we intend either to establish a sales and marketing organization with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize Coversin, or to outsource this function to a third party.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We currently rely on a third-party contract manufacturer (CMO), which complies with FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practice requirements, for all of our clinical supplies, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, drug substances and finished drug products for our preclinical research and clinical trials, including the Phase I/II trials for Coversin. Analytical methods that define activity, identity, purity, sterility, endotoxin, and host cell related impurities have been established and qualified for release testing of drug substance. We expect to complete scale-up to commercial fermentation batch sizes and yields with this CMO by the end of 2016.

&#160;

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, for the manufacture of Coversin and any other drug candidates that it may develop for larger scale preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial quantities of any drug candidates that are approved.

&#160;

We currently expect initial commercial supplies of Coversin to be supplied as a dry powder together with syringes prefilled with sterile water for injection. This will enable the drug to be stored for long periods at room temperature and simplify distribution and storage by hospitals and pharmacies. Further evaluation activities are ongoing regarding potential future alternate drug delivery and device options and/or improvements.

&#160;

We plan to expand our relationship with the current CMO for commercial supplies of Coversin if and when it nears potential approval, and plans to examine alternate CMOs for secondary commercial supplies of Coversin.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had five full-time employees and two full-time equivalent consultants.

&#160;

Properties 

&#160;

We do not currently own any property. We currently lease 4,900 square feet of office space in New York, New York, for approximately $24,000 per month. The lease for this property expires in August 2019. We also lease 1,260 square feet of office space in London, England, for approximately $12,000 per month. The lease for this property expires in March 2019.

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We will be able to protect our technology and products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are thus an essential element of our business.

&#160;

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing its proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect its proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to its proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of its business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

&#160;

We own or have exclusive rights to two United States and 16 foreign issued patents and allowed patent applications, and five United States and 14 foreign pending patent applications, relating to the complement C5 inhibitor protein Coversin and its use in the treatment of key disease indications. Our current patent portfolio covers the jurisdictions of United States, Canada, major European countries, Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand.

&#160;

Issued United States patents which cover our product candidate Coversin will expire between 2024 and 2025, excluding any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. Issued patents outside of the United States directed to our product candidate Coversin and its uses will expire between 2024 and 2031. We have pending patent applications for our product candidate Coversin that, if issued, would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2024 and 2035, excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of the patent and any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. These pending patent applications relate to the following specific compositions and methods: complement inhibitor molecule; methods for treating myasthenia gravis; methods for treating peripheral nerve disorders; methods for treating respiratory disorders; and methods for treating viral infections of the respiratory tract. In addition, we have a pending patent application on C5 polymorphisms that, if issued, would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States in 2035, excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of the patent and any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations.

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160;

Most of Coversin&#8217;s target disease indications are rare diseases, and therefore our plans to pursue orphan drug designation where possible. If granted, each such designation might provide for regulatory exclusivity for seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union from the date of product approval for individual indications.

&#160;

Eculizumab has been granted Orphan Status for some of the same disease indications that we propose to treat with Coversin. However, Coversin is not considered structurally similar to eculizumab, and so these preceding Orphan Designations should not pose a barrier to market entry for Coversin. There is also a possibility for us to obtain additional Orphan Designation(s) for Coversin beyond those already granted to eculizumab, based on the substantial medical benefits that it may offer in terms of its efficacy in certain clinical populations and dosage forms.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160;

Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those that the Company is developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the biologics license application, or BLA, process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S. The animal and other non-clinical data and the results of human clinical trials performed under an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, and under similar foreign applications will become part of the NDA or BLA.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

U.S. Drug Development Process 

&#160;

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, requesting product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations; &#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#160; &#8226; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; &#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; &#160; &#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and &#160; &#8226; FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. &#160;

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.

&#160;

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice regulations. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually. In addition, timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. &#160; &#8226; Phase II: This phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. &#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Phase III: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.

&#160; 

The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.

&#160;

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug.

&#160;

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

&#160; 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

&#160;

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA, or an approval letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

NDAs or BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity and original BLAs will be six months from the date that the NDA or BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process.

&#160;

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized.

&#160;

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted in 2012, made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.

&#160;

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160;

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

&#160;

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. The FDASIA made permanent the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, which provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. If the Written Request does not include studies in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those studies. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies.

&#160;

&#160; 

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 

&#160;

On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of &#8220;generic&#8221; biologics &#8212; biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve-year exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.

&#160;

The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.

&#160;

An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances.

&#160;

The FDA has issued a number of final and draft guidances in order to implement the law. On April 28, 2015, the FDA issued the following three final guidances: &#8220;Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product,&#8221; &#8220;Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity of a Therapeutic Protein Product to a Reference Product,&#8221; and &#8220;Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 Guidance for Industry.&#8221; The draft guidances include &#8220;Formal Meetings between the FDA and Biosimilar Biological Product Sponsors or Applicants&#8221; issued March 29, 2013, &#8220;Clinical Pharmacology Data to Support a Demonstration of Biosimilarity to a Reference Product&#8221; issued May 13, 2014, &#8220;Reference Product Exclusivity for Biological Products Filed Under Section 351(a) of the PHS Act&#8221; issued August 4, 2014, and &#8220;Biosimilars: Additional Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009,&#8221; issued May 12, 2015. The guidance documents provide FDA&#8217;s current thinking on approaches to demonstrating that a proposed biological product is biosimilar to a reference product. The FDA intends to issue additional guidance documents in the future. Nevertheless, the absence of final guidance documents covering all biosimilars issues does not prevent a sponsor for seeking licensure of a biosimilar under the BPCIA, and the FDA recently approved the first biosimilar application in the United States.

&#160;

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical trials to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions. A product does not have to be designated as an orphan drug to be eligible for the grant program. An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition. The study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market.

&#160; 

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 

&#160;

The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request.

&#160;

Under the fast track program, the FDA may designate a drug for fast-track status if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening illness and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Similarly, the agency may designate a drug for accelerated approval if it treats a serious condition and generally provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.

&#160;

In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

&#160;

In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug&#8217;s BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#8217;s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

&#160;

In FDASIA, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law&#8217;s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In May 2014, the FDA published a Guidance for Industry entitled, &#8220;Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics&#8221; which provides guidance on FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a drug is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy designation. A request for Breakthrough Therapy designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to an IND. The FDA has already granted this designation to over 30 new drugs and has approved several.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160;

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.

&#160;

Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.

&#160;

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

&#160;

Foreign Regulation 

&#160;

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 28-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

&#160;

Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more &#8220;concerned&#8221; member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the &#8220;reference&#8221; member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#8217;s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the submission and approval of a clinical trial authorization application be obtained in each Member State be obtained before commencing a clinical trial in that Member State.

&#160;

As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor&#8217;s generic product. For example, in the EU, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the European Economic Area, or EEA which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, we expect they will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of marketing exclusivity. An additional one-year extension of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period, we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that is deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product&#8217;s first marketing authorization in the EU and prevents biosimilars from relying on the holder of the marketing authorization for the reference biological medicine&#8217;s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of eight years. After eight years, a biosimilar product application may be submitted and the sponsoring companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder&#8217;s data. However, a biosimilar medicine cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight year data exclusivity period.

&#160;

As in the United States, a sponsor may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.

Reimbursement 

&#160;

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our drug candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.

&#160;

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
