Business Overview 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s goal is to create profitability for investors through the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Be the premier provider of local journalism excellence in North Texas so citizens can make informed choices about their lives and the life of the communities in which they live. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Provide customers with the most comprehensive suite of business marketing solutions. 

&#160; 

Since the Company&#8217;s spin-off in 2008, the print media industry has encountered continuous declines of revenue primarily due to the secular shift of readers and advertisers to digital platforms. The Company has sought to limit its exposure to the industry risks through the greater development and enhancement of digital platforms for delivery of news and advertising, and through diversification of sources of revenue, from both organic growth and acquisitions of marketing services and new products. 

&#160; 

In 2014 and 2013, the Company divested its newspaper operations in Providence, Rhode Island and Riverside, California in order to strategically monetize these assets. These newspaper operations, located in economically weak regions of the United States, were sold at optimal pricing, and sales proceeds were used to enhance shareholder value and to invest in the acquisition and organic development of businesses with expected growth opportunities. The dispositions of these operations allowed executive management to provide greater focus on growing its business in the North Texas region, where the Company&#8217;s primary operations reside. 

&#160; 

The Company restructured its editorial and newsroom departments in 2015 in order to strengthen the depth of experience to support the broader delivery of news on digital platforms. A new editor was recruited, who was the former editor of the digital news pure play, FiveThirtyEight. Additionally, a nationally recognized digital journalist was recruited as the managing editor and resources have been made available through 2016 to expand existing digital talent within the newsroom. The Company has redesigned and expanded its website platforms and mobile apps to provide greater digital reporting of local news and information, and to expand the delivery of advertising and marketing services across a host of continuously changing media devices and platforms. The Company expects to continue to make significant investment in its digital news operations throughout 2016. 

&#160; 

On January 2, 2015, the Company acquired an 80 percent voting interest in DMV Digital Holdings Company, Inc. into which the stock of three Dallas-based companies, Distribion, Inc., (&#8220;Distribion&#8221;), Vertical Nerve, Inc. (&#8220;Vertical Nerve&#8221;) and CDFX, LLC (d/b/a &#8220;MarketingFX&#8221;), were contributed. These businesses specialize in local marketing automation, search engine marketing, direct mail and promotional products, respectively. This acquisition complements the organic growth realized by Speakeasy and the Company&#8217;s Connect division, which offers content development, social media management, and multi-channel marketing solutions through targeted and programmatic exchanges. With the addition of these businesses, the Company has realized efficiencies through internal fulfillment of work that was previously out-sourced to third-party vendors and can provide businesses a more comprehensive suite of marketing solutions simplifying the efforts required to reach desired audiences through email and social, mobile and web platforms. 

&#160; 

From the divestiture transactions, the Company has built cash balances that will be preserved for organic or acquisition opportunities in later years. In 2016, management will focus its attention and initiatives on maximizing the return on its print assets, enhancing its digital publishing capabilities as well as development and expansion of the marketing solution ecosystem that has been built so that the margins realized by these businesses can grow. 

&#160; 

As a result of the greater strategic alignment within the Company&#8217;s newspaper and within its marketing services operations in 2015, the Company has established separate segments for its publishing operations and for its marketing, event marketing, and other services. These operations had previously been reported as a single segment. The results of operations related to the Company&#8217;s segments are presented in Item 7 - Management Discussion and Analysis.

Publishing Segment 

&#160; 

The Dallas Morning News&#8217; first edition was published on October 1, 1885 and is one of the leading metropolitan newspapers in the United States. The newspaper is distributed primarily in Dallas County and 10 surrounding counties. This coverage area represents one of the most populous and fastest growing metropolitan areas in the country. The Dallas Morning News has been awarded nine Pulitzer Prizes for news reporting, editorial writing and photography. The Dallas Morning Ne ws also publishes Briefing , a newspaper distributed four days per week at no charge to over 200,000 nonsubscribers in select coverage areas; and Al Dia , an award-winning Spanish-language newspaper published on Wednesdays and Sundays and distributed at no charge to over 100,000 households in select coverage areas. Unless otherwise noted, the financial and operating results of all publications are reported as The Dallas Morning News . 

Businesses producing and providing services within the print and paper industry have encountered significant decline in revenue &#160; as a result of increasing use of the internet for delivery of information. These businesses have been challenged to find alternative solutions to offset the loss of revenue. The majority of revenues within the newspaper industry were historically generated from display and classified advertisements within the newspapers followed by revenues from subs cription and retail sales of newspapers. Since the spin-off from its parent company in 2008, the Company has faced the ongoing revenue decline in all its print products, particularly adve rtising within the newspapers. Revenues from subscription and retail sales of newspapers ha ve observed greater res i lience as readers have been willing to pa y higher prices for the product, which has substantially offset lower circulation volumes . 

The following chart presents the revenue trend of core print products since the Company's spin-off in 2008.

&#160;

The following describes the various revenue streams within the publishing segment. 

&#160; 

Advertising Revenue - Advertising revenue accounted for approximately 58.0 percent of total revenue within the publishing segment for 2015. The Company has a comprehensive portfolio of print and digital advertising products which include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Display Advertising &#8211; Display revenue results from sales of advertising space within the Company&#8217;s core newspapers and niche publications to local, regional or national businesses with local operations, affiliates or resellers. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Classified Advertising &#8211; Classified revenue, which includes automotive, real estate, employment, obituaries and other, results from sales of advertising space in the classified and other sections of the Company&#8217;s newspapers. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Preprint Advertising &#8211; Preprint revenue results from sales of preprinted advertisements or circulars inserted into the Company&#8217;s core newspapers and niche publications, or distributed by mail or third-party distributors to households in targeted areas in order to provide total market coverage for advertisers. The Company&#8217;s capabilities allow its advertisers to selectively target preprint distribution at the sub-zip code level in order to optimize coverage for the advertisers&#8217; locations. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Digital Advertising &#8211; Digital publishing revenue includes the sales of banner, classified and native advertisements on the Company&#8217;s news and entertainment-related websites and mobile apps. 

&#8195; 

In addition to daily newspapers, the Company publishes niche publications which provide a vehicle for delivery of display, classified, and preprint advertising, typically to nonsubscribers of the Company&#8217;s core newspapers and at no charge. These publications target specific demographic groups, geographies and nonsubscriber households. Most niche publications have related websites and mobile applications, allowing digital access by consumers. The niche publications provide unique content, but usually incorporate the news content from the core newspapers while leveraging the Company&#8217;s printing, distribution and technology infrastructure to drive additional advertising revenue at a low incremental cost. From time to time, the Company produces magazines or special newspaper editions to promote business, sporting or other events in the North Texas region, such as the Top 100 Places to Work edition. These publications allow the Company to generate revenue through advertising sales in the publications and through increased circulation or fees for the publications. 

&#160; 

Circulation Revenue - Circulation revenue includes subscription and single copy sales related to the Company&#8217;s core newspapers in print and digital formats. A. H. Belo&#8217;s steadfast commitment to producing superior, unduplicated local content enables the Company&#8217;s newspapers to charge premium subscription rates . The Dallas Morning News&#8217; goal is to maximize the amount of recurring revenue from consumers of the Company&#8217;s print and digital products. The Company continuously assesses the content provided to subscribers and their willingness and ability to pay higher rates by geographic area. Each year since 2008, the Company has implemented effective rate increases to select subscribers or retailers. Periodically throughout each year, various special interest magazines, such as Healthy Living or Your Money , are included with Sunday editions as a part of subscribers&#8217; home delivery news package. Subscriber and retail rates for these editions reflect a charge for this content. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s news websites, including dallasnews.com , dentonrc.com and aldiadallas.com , are the leading news and entertainment platforms in the North Texas region. The news websites offers users late-breaking and other up-to-date news coverage, user-generated content, advertising, e-commerce and other services. Readers can access news content across multiple digital platforms and obtain relevant local customized content and advertising. The Company&#8217;s journalists have expanded their reach and deepened their engagement with audiences by delivering news and content through social media platforms, such as blogs, Facebook and Twitter, which direct traffic to its core websites. With the reorganization of its editorial and newsroom personnel in 2015, the Company has strengthened its focus to provide greater journalistic content on its digital platforms with increased emphasis towards video media. 

The Company is currently undergoing a multi-phase expansion of dallasnews.com to provide enhanced capabilities on its flagship website and further development of its entertainment brands. In 2015, the Company completed the expansion of its e-commerce functions and extended its interface with social media platforms and mobile devices. A standalone website was created for guidelive.com , the premier website for entertainment news and events in North Texas. Unique landing pages solely dedicated to the Company&#8217;s SportsdayDFW.com and SportsdayHS.com branded platforms were developed, and separate websites for these platforms will be launched in 2016. These enhancements allow the websites to leverage the identity of their brands to gain greater audience and to quickly respond as technology evolves and new media are introduced, such as wearable devices or hybrid phone or tablet devices. The Company anticipates it will continue to make significant capital investment in its websites in 2016 as it further expands data collection capabilities for traffic to its websites, allowing support of native application strategies, and greater interface with visitors and advertisers.

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s news websites are currently accessible to everyone, free of charge. A digital replica version of The Dallas Morning News is offered on dallasnews.com for subscribers to pay for if they prefer to consume news through a digital device in a more traditional format. Between 2011 and 2013, the Company implemented a paywall on dallasnews.com, whereby users were charged a monthly subscription for select premium content on the news website. The paywall was discontinued in 2013 due to weak subscription revenue. The Company is actively seeking alternative options for monetization of premium digital content, such as the establishment of a meter whereby users would pay a fee for consumption of premium content exceeding a minimum threshold. 

Readership of the Company&#8217;s newspapers is tracked by Scarborough Research, which estimated the number of individuals reading a newspaper print edition to be approximately 1,260,000 for The Dallas Morning News, a s reported in the September 2015 Publishers&#8217; Statements, which are subject to audit. This readership volume represents a reach of approximately 26.0 percent of the designated market for this newspaper in the Company&#8217;s circulation area. The average print and digital volumes associated with A. H. Belo&#8217;s primary daily newspaper and niche publications are reported and verified by a circulation audit agency, as set forth in the table below.

Daily circulation is defined as a Monday through Saturday six-day average.

Average circulation data for The Dallas Morning News includes its niche publications and the Denton Record-Chronicle. Data for 2015 was obtained from the Quarterly Data Reports for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015, and data for 2014 and 2013 was obtained from the Publisher&#8217;s Statement for the six-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, as filed with the Alliance for Audited Media (the &#8220;Audit Bureau&#8221;). The 2015 statements are subject to audit. Year-over-year increase in reported daily circulation for 2014 for The Dallas Morning News is due to increased reported digital subscribers for each of these periods. 

Printing, Distribution and Other Revenue - P rinting, distribution and other revenue accounted for approximately 12 percent of total revenue for 2015 and includes commercial printing, distribution, direct mail and event-based services. The Company provides commercial printing and distribution services, leveraging the capacity of its production and distribution assets to provide economic alternatives for customers seeking overhead relief. The incremental revenue from these services allows a greater return on the Company&#8217;s operating assets. 

Commercial printing services are provided for certain national newspapers that require regional printing and for various local and regional newspapers. Newsprint used in the production of large national newspapers is generally provided by the customer. Home delivery and retail outlet distribution services are also provided for other national and regional newspapers delivered into the Company&#8217;s coverage areas. A direct mail business is operated in Phoenix, Arizona, providing mailed advertisements for its business customers.

Marketing Services 

&#160; 

Digital marketing services are offered by the Company&#8217;s sales and marketing divisions and by its subsidiaries, Speakeasy and DMV Holdings. Through organic growth and acquisitions, the Company is able to offer small to mid-sized businesses a comprehensive marketing solutions package while providing a greater percentage of the marketing fulfillment costs internally that was previously outsourced to third-party providers. During 2015, the Company has aligned management and the Company&#8217;s sales teams to provide a cross-functional integrated approach to maximize the development of these businesses. Digital marketing services are provided as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183;

CrowdSource seeks to expand its presence across Dallas/Ft Worth as a leading organizer of events and focus its initiatives on those events which are expected to generate profitable returns. 

Raw Materials and Distribution 

The basic material used in publishing newspapers is newsprint. Currently, most of the Company&#8217;s newsprint is obtained through a purchasing consortium. Management believes the Company&#8217;s sources of newsprint, along with available alternate sources, are adequate for the Company&#8217;s current needs. 

During 2015 , Company operations consumed 31,141 metric tons of newsprint at an average of $550 per metric ton. Consumption of newsprint in 2014 was 33,717 metric tons at an average cost of $ 589 per metric ton.

&#160;

Competitive Strengths and Challenges 

The Company&#8217;s strengths are: 

&#183; 

the largest news gathering operation in North Texas 

&#183; 

due to the millions of unique visitors who come to the Company&#8217;s websites and apps daily, the Company has the opportunity to build valuable first-party data about consumers in North Texas 

&#183; 

the ability to develop innovative new product and service offerings which leverage the Company&#8217;s brand equity, existing content, distribution platforms, technologies and relationships 

&#183; 

product or service offerings that allow the Company to offer advertisers a customized and integrated advertising and marketing solution through desired media channels 

&#183; 

sufficient liquidity to allow the Company to opportunistically invest in , or acquire businesses , that complement the Company&#8217;s advertising or marketing services business 

&#183; 

an affluent and educated demographic base in its market 

&#183; 

the ability to market print or digital products and services to large and targeted audiences at low marginal costs 

&#183; 

a large sales force with knowledge of the marketplaces in which the Company conducts its business and relationships with current and potential advertising clients 

&#183; 

the ability to effectively manage operating costs according to market pressures 

The Company&#8217;s challenges are: 

&#183; 

timely growth of profit margins related to the Company&#8217;s marketing services businesses that would provide for an offset of declines in revenue of the Company&#8217;s print operations &#160; 

&#183; 

maintaining and growing advertising and circulation revenues in a competitive environment with increased competition from other media, particularly the internet 

&#183; 

effective monetization of locally created online content on the Company&#8217;s websites while balancing the impact of potential lower traffic volumes with an established paywall or metered-based model 

&#183; 

driving digital advertising revenue while limiting intrusive ads that slow page load times 

In response to the decline in print revenue, the Company has developed or acquired capabilities to offer customers advertising and marketing solutions through multiple media channels. The Company also continues to diversify its revenue base by leveraging the available capacity of its existing assets to provide print and distribution services for newspapers and other customers requiring these services, by introducing new advertising and marketing services products, by increasing circulation prices and through growth of the Company&#8217;s event based business. 

As a result of declining print circulation, the Company has developed broad digital strategies designed to provide readers with multiple platforms for obtaining online access to local news. The Company continues to obtain additional key demographic data from readers, which allows the Company to provide content most desired by readers and to modify marketing and distribution strategies to target and reach audiences most valued by advertisers. The Company has implemented a programmatic digital advertising platform which provides digital ad placement and targeting efficiencies and increases utilization of digital inventory within the Company&#8217;s websites as well as on external websites. Initiatives are also being implemented with the Company&#8217;s sales teams to better utilize pay for performance data and other metrics in generating and returning lost advertising dollars to its print business.

&#160;

Strategy 

A. &#160; H. Belo is committed to producing positive net income and cash flow and creating value for shareholders over the long-term through stock price appreciation and dividends. The Company continuously evaluates its operations and investments against various economic factors to determine the appropriate holding strategies. 

In 2014 and 2013, the Company completed various dispositions of investments, newspaper assets and operations in Rhode Island and California, and non- essential real estate assets, all at opportunistic prices. Sales proceeds were used to return money to shareholders, provide additional contributions to the Company&#8217;s pension plans, and invest in new businesses that complement ed and leverage d existing core operations. T he Company continues to seek investments that will provide near and long term returns to replace the declining print revenue and continuously implements measures to control operating expenses as it develop s and grow s new businesses . These measures are implemented through divesting &#160; of unprofitable products and services, adjusting the Company&#8217;s workforce and benefits to align with revenues and market conditions, and restructuring operations through organizational realignments. Returns on operating and investing assets are evaluated to ensure the appropriate return on investment is achieved and capital is deployed to the benefit of its shareholders. &#160; 

The Company is committed to providing the leading digital and print platforms for delivering news of the highest quality and integrity in the North Texas area, as well as creating and developing innovative print and digital products addressing the needs of consumers and advertisers. The Company intends to achieve these objectives through the following strategies: 

&#183; 

expand the marketing services sales teams to grow revenue in these emerging businesses 

&#183; 

optimize and leverage marketing and sales capabilitie s in an integrated manner for existing print and digital products that creates sustainable revenue and earnings 

&#183; 

produce quality local content distributed through digital and print platforms , &#160; improving the user interface and developing stronger retention methods among print readers 

&#183; 

develop new ways to monetize news content delivered on the Company&#8217;s news and entertainment websites 

&#183; 

increase utilization of operating assets through selling commercial printing and distribution services to third parties 

&#183; 

continue to align costs with revenue, maintain strong liquidity to support future business and product initiatives and provide flexibility to meet strategic investment opportunities and other cash flow requirements 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

The Company&#8217;s newspapers, niche publications and related websites primarily serve audiences in the North Texas area. The Company&#8217;s newspapers compete for advertising revenue for its newspapers and websites with other print and digital media companies. Advertising revenues for the Company&#8217;s newspapers and on its websites are responsive to circulation and traffic volumes, demographics of its subscriber base, advertising results, rates and customer service. Advertising on digital platforms is highly competitive and largely dominated by large i nternet companies. As advertisers reallocate marketing expenditures from print to digital channels, the Company believes its strong local brand, its suite of print and digital advertising and marketing service products, a ffiliate agreements with large i nternet advertisers, and its programmatic digital advertising platform will allow it to offer unique advertising and marketing solutions to local businesses on a competitive scale. 

The Dallas Morning News has the highest paid print circulation volumes in the North Texas area while competing with one other metropolitan newspaper in parts of its geographic market. Print c irculation revenues are primarily challenged due to free and readily accessible news, entertainment, advertising and other content available through the i nternet. This secular shift from print to digital media continues as consumer lifestyles embrace technological advancements, particularly with mobile devices, which provide access to a wide variety of digital news and advertising alternatives, including news and social media websites, online advertising networks and exchanges, online classified services, and direct email advertising. Competition for readers is primarily based on the mode of delivery, quality of the Company&#8217;s journalism, price, timeliness of its interaction with audiences and customer service. News and other digital content produced by the Company&#8217;s newspapers and niche publications is available via its websites , apps and through email. The Company offers the competitive technology for accessing digital content on mobile devices and via personal computers. Journalists engage online readers through blogs, Twitter and other social media posts. The Company has modified its websites to provide greater video content and advertising, links to other sites sought by readers, improved layouts, and a better interface with mobile applications.
