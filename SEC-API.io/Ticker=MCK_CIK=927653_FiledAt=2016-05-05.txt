McKESSON CORPORATION 

Distribution Solutions Segment 

Our Distribution Solutions segment consists of the following businesses: North America pharmaceutical distribution and services, International pharmaceutical distribution and services and Medical-Surgical distribution and services. 

North America pharmaceutical distribution and services 

Our North America pharmaceutical distribution and services business is comprised of the following business units: U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution, McKesson Specialty Health, McKesson Canada, and McKesson Pharmacy Technology &#38; Services. 

U.S. Pharmaceutical Distribution : This business supplies branded, specialty and generic pharmaceuticals and other healthcare-related products to customers throughout the United States in three primary customer channels: (1) retail national accounts (including national and regional chains, food/drug combinations, mail order pharmacies and mass merchandisers); (2) independent retail pharmacies; and (3) institutional healthcare providers (including hospitals, health systems, integrated delivery networks, clinics and alternate site providers). This business also provides solutions and services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. This business sources materials and products from a wide-array of different suppliers, including certain generic pharmaceutical drugs produced through a contract-manufacturing program. 

Our U.S. pharmaceutical distribution business operates and serves thousands of customer locations through a network of 31 distribution centers, as well as a primary redistribution center, a strategic redistribution center and two repackaging facilities, serving all 50 states and Puerto Rico. We invest in technology and other systems at all of our distribution centers to enhance safety and reliability and to provide the best product availability for our customers. For example, in most of our distribution centers we use Acumax&#174; Plus, an award-winning technology that integrates and tracks all internal inventory-related functions such as receiving, put-away and order fulfillment. Acumax&#174; Plus uses bar code technology, wrist-mounted computer hardware and radio frequency signals to provide customers with real-time product availability and industry-leading order quality and fulfillment in excess of 99.9% adjusted accuracy. In addition, we offer Mobile Manager SM , which integrates portable handheld technology with Acumax&#174; Plus to give customers complete ordering and inventory control. We also offer McKesson Connect SM , an internet-based ordering system that provides item lookup and real-time inventory availability as well as ordering, purchasing, third-party reconciliation and account management functionality. Together, these features help ensure customers have the right products at the right time for their facilities and patients. 

To maximize distribution efficiency and effectiveness, we follow the Six Sigma methodology &#8212; an analytical approach that emphasizes setting high-quality objectives, collecting data and analyzing results to a fine degree in order to improve processes, reduce costs and minimize errors. We continue to implement information systems to help achieve greater consistency and accuracy both internally and for our customers.

MSH is focused on three core business lines: Manufacturer Solutions, Practice Management and Provider Solutions. 

McKESSON CORPORATION 

Manufacturer Solutions help manufacturers accelerate the approval and successful commercialization of specialty pharmaceuticals across the product life cycle. MSH&#8217;s offerings include supply chain services, including specialty pharmacy services and third party logistics (&#8220;3PL&#8221;), provider and patient engagement programs, clinical trial support, patient assistance programs, reimbursement services, and analytics. In addition, MSH helps manufacturers minimize reimbursement challenges while offering affordable, safe access to therapies through Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) programs. 

In April 2016, we completed the acquisition of Biologics, Inc (&#8220;Biologics&#8221;), a Cary, North Carolina-based company that provides oncology pharmacy services to providers and patients as well as solutions for manufacturers and payers. For manufacturers, Biologics helps optimize speed-to-therapy, enhance patient adherence and improve patient access to therapy. In addition, Biologics works with manufacturers to develop custom strategies to enhance the clinical and commercial success of their products at each stage of the life-cycle. 

Practice Management provides a variety of solutions, including practice operations, healthcare information technology, revenue cycle management and managed care contracting solutions, evidence-based guidelines and quality measurements to support The U.S. Oncology Network, one of the nation&#8217;s largest network of integrated, community-based oncology practices dedicated to advancing high-quality, evidence-based cancer care. We also support U.S. Oncology Research, one of the nation&#8217;s largest research networks, specializing in oncology clinical trials. 

In April 2016, we also completed the acquisition of Vantage Oncology Holdings LLC (&#8220;Vantage&#8221;), a leading national provider of integrated oncology and radiation services headquartered in Manhattan Beach, California. Vantage&#8217;s comprehensive oncology management services model, including its focus on community-based radiation oncology, medical oncology, and other integrated cancer care services, complements and strengthens the existing offerings of McKesson and The US Oncology Network, while allowing patients to access the care they need in an efficient and cost effective way. 

Provider Solutions offers community specialists (oncologists, rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, urologists, neurologists, and other specialists) an extensive set of customizable products and services designed to strengthen core practice operations, enhance value-based care delivery, and expand their service offering to patients. Tools and services include specialty drug distribution and group purchasing organization (&#8220;GPO&#8221;) services, technology solutions, practice consulting services, and vaccine distribution, including our exclusive distributor relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) Vaccines for Children program. Community-based physicians in this business line have broad flexibility and choice to select the products and commitment levels that best meet their practice needs. 

When we classify a pharmaceutical product or service as &#8220;specialty,&#8221; we consider the following factors: diseases requiring complex treatment regimens such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; ongoing clinical monitoring requirements, high-cost, special handling, storage and delivery requirements and, in some cases, exclusive distribution arrangements. Our use of the term &#8220;specialty&#8221; to define a portion of our distribution business may not be comparable to that used by other industry participants, including our competitors. 

McKesson Canada: &#32;&#32;McKesson Canada is one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in Canada. McKesson Canada, through its network of 14 distribution centers, provides logistics and distribution for manufacturers - delivering their products to retail pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, clinics and institutions throughout Canada and through its network of infusion clinics, offers specialty services and adherence programs. Beyond pharmaceutical distribution, logistics and order fulfillment, McKesson Canada provides automation solutions to its retail and hospital customers, dispensing millions of doses each year. McKesson Canada also provides health information exchange solutions that streamline clinical and administrative communication and retail banner services that help independent pharmacists compete and grow through innovative services and operation support. In partnership with other McKesson businesses, McKesson Canada provides a full range of services to Canadian manufacturers and healthcare providers, contributing to the quality and safety of care for patients. 

In March 2016, we entered into an agreement to purchase Rexall Health from Katz Group for $3 billion &#32;Canadian dollars (or, approximately $2.3 billion &#32;U.S. dollars using the currency exchange ratio of 0.77 &#32;Canadian dollar to 1 &#32;U.S. dollar as of March 31, 2016). Rexall Health, which operates approximately 470 &#32;retail pharmacies in Canada, particularly in Ontario and Western Canada, will enhance our Canadian pharmaceutical supply chain. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close during the second half of calendar year 2016.

The sale is expected to close during the first half of 2017.

Competition 

Our Distribution Solutions segment faces a highly competitive global environment with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations. In addition, this segment faces competition from various other service providers and from pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of the segment, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by the segment. In all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer. 

Our Technology Solutions segment experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, certain hospitals and hospital groups, payers, care management organizations, hardware vendors and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition varies in size from small to large companies, in geographical coverage and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. 

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses 

McKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services. We pursue patent protection for our innovation, and obtain copyrights covering our original works of authorship, when such protection is advantageous. Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries. 

We believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson&#8217;s confidential information, patents, copyrights, and trademarks are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers. We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operation. 

McKESSON CORPORATION 

We hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson&#8217;s products or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations and products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party. 

Other Information about the Business 

Customers: &#32;&#32;During 2016 , sales to our ten &#32;largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (&#8220;GPOs&#8221;) accounted for approximately 52.4% &#32;of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health (&#8220;CVS&#8221;), accounted for approximately 20.3% &#32;of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2016 , trade accounts receivable from our ten &#32;largest customers were approximately 32% &#32;of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS &#32;were approximately 18% &#32;of total trade accounts receivable. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our Distribution Solutions segment. 

Suppliers: We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for more than 6% of our purchases in 2016 . The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers, as a whole, are good. The ten largest suppliers in 2016 &#32;accounted for approximately 44% of our purchases. 

A significant portion of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margin. 

Research and Development: &#32;&#32;Research and development costs were $392 million , $392 million &#32;and $457 million &#32;during 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . These costs do not include $30 million , $34 million &#32;and $40 million &#32;of costs capitalized for software held for sale during 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . Development expenditures are primarily incurred by our Technology Solutions segment. Our Technology Solutions segment&#8217;s product development efforts apply computer technology and installation methodologies to specific information processing needs of hospitals and other customers. We believe that a substantial and sustained commitment to such expenditures is important to the long-term success of this business. Additional information regarding our development activities is included in Financial Note 1, &#8220;Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Environmental Regulation: Our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. 

We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program. 

We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are described further in Financial Note 24, &#8220;Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,&#8221; to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

McKESSON CORPORATION 

The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the Company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals, including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations, are presently not material to our operations or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters. Other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations, we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues, or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. The amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2016 &#32;and is not expected to be material in the next year. 

Employees: &#32;&#32;On March 31, 2016 , we employed approximately 68,000 full-time equivalent employees.
