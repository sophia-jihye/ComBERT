Services and Products 

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of HCM services and products that allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human resource needs. Clients can select services on an &#225; la carte basis or as part of various product bundles. Our payroll-related ancillary services and Human Resource Service (&#8220;HRS&#8221;) offerings often leverage the information gathered in the base payroll processing service, allowing us to provide comprehensive outsourcing services covering the HCM spectrum. We also offer professional employer organization (&#8220;PEO&#8221;) services and provide insurance offerings through the Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc. (&#8220;PIA&#8221;) that allow employers to expand their employee benefit offerings at an affordable cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and utilization of ancillary services. 

Paychex Flex SM is our proprietary HCM software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) platform through which we provide an integrated product suite that covers the employee life cycle from recruiting and hiring to retirement. Paychex Flex streamlines workforce management through innovative technology and flexible choice of service. The platform uses a single cloud-based platform, with single client and employee records, and single sign-on, including self-service options and mobility applications.

Paychex Flex also provides technology-enabled service, with options that include self-service, a 24/7 dedicated service center, individual payroll specialist, and integrated service via the multi-product service center.

&#160;

Small-Business Clients 

For our small-business clients, which we define as typically less than 50 employees, Paychex supports the client in reducing the complexity and risk of running their own payroll, while ensuring greater accuracy with up-to-date tax rates and regulatory information. We simplify their payroll with a combination of our dynamic products and customer service for a quick and easy pay day. Small-business payroll is provided via our core payroll, utilizing our robust Paychex Flex processing platform, or SurePayroll &#174; products. Our core payroll clients can opt for our full-service customer service model through our branch operations or use Paychex Online Payroll &#174; , our secure Internet portal. Paychex Online Payroll offers a suite of self-service and interactive services twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Both service models offer payroll processing, employee access online, general ledger service to provide payroll information to the client&#8217;s general ledger accounting software, and access to our industry-leading, web-based report center and robust report writer. Our SurePayroll SaaS solution offers &#8220;do-it-yourself,&#8221; self-service and mobile applications for small business. 

Our small-business clients also benefit from our time and attendance products, which allow them to accurately and efficiently manage the gathering and recording of employee hours worked. Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, can assist companies with the scheduling, tracking, and reporting of time which can be beneficial to clients in complying with overtime regulations recently enacted by the Department of Labor. &#160; Other Paychex solutions, such as our comprehensive human resource outsourcing solutions are also available for our small-business clients. 

Mid-Market Clients 

Our mid-market clients are typically defined as more than 50 employees with more complex payroll and employee benefit needs. These clients are serviced through our Paychex Flex Enterprise solution set, which offers an integrated suite of HCM solutions on the Paychex Flex platform, or through our traditional mid-market platform. Clients using Paychex Flex Enterprise are offered a SaaS solution that integrates payroll processing with human resource management, employee benefits administration, time and labor management, applicant tracking and onboarding solutions. Paychex Flex Enterprise allows our mid-market clients to choose the services and software they need to meet the complexity of the business and have them integrated through one HCM solution. 

Mid-market clients also have the option to select from a number of &#225; la carte payroll and human resource ancillary services and can opt for our comprehensive human resource and payroll outsourcing solutions, Paychex HR Services. This flexibility allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their particular needs. 

Description of Services 

Payroll processing: For both our small-business and mid-market clients, payroll processing is the backbone of our portfolio of HCM services. Payroll processing services include the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients&#8217; payroll obligations. Along with payroll processing, clients can also select from the following payroll-related ancillary services: 

&#183; 

Payroll tax administration services: Our payroll tax administration services provide accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies (federal, state, and local). In connection with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients&#8217; bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending to 90 days. We handle regula tory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes. 

&#183; 

Employee payment services: Our employee payment services provide an employer with the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex &#174; ), or a check drawn on the employer&#8217;s account and electronically signed by us. For each of the first three methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the clients&#8217; bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide payment to the employees on payday. Our Readychex service provides a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Regulatory compliance services: We offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to comply with federal and state requirements to report information on newly hired employees. This information aids the government in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent unemployment and workers&#8217; compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from employees&#8217; pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties. 

Human Resource Services: We offer complementary services for outsourcing of various human resource functions to our payroll clients. In addition, some of these services can be provided to clients who do not opt for payroll processing. Our complementary services are categorized as follows: 

&#183; 

Paychex HR Services: We offer comprehensive human resource outsourcing solutions that provide businesses a full-service approach to the outsourcing of employer and employee administrative needs. Our Paychex HR Services offering is available through Paychex HR Solutions, an administrative services organization (&#8220;ASO&#8221;), or Paychex PEO. Both options offer businesses a combined package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance, human resource and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained human resource representative. These comprehensive bundles of services are designed to make it easier for businesses to manage their payroll and related benefit costs while providing a benefits package equal to that of larger companies. Our PEO differs from the ASO in that we serve as a co-employer of the clients&#8217; employees, provide health care coverage to PEO employees, and assume the risks and rewards of workers&#8217; compensation insurance and certain health insurance offerings. PEO services are sold through our registered and licensed subsidiary, Paychex Business Solutions, LLC. We also offer Paychex HR Essentials, which is an ASO product that provides support to our clients over the phone or online to help manage employee-rel ated topics. As of May 31, 2016 , Payche x HR Services was utilized by approximately 35 ,00 0 clients with approximately 944 ,000 client worksite employees. 

&#183; 

Retirement services administration: Our retirement services product line offers a variety of options to clients, including 401(k) plans, 401(k) SIMPLE plans, SIMPLE IRAs, 401(k) plans with safe harbor provisions, owner-only 401(k) plans, profit sharing plans, and money purchase plans. These services provide plan implementation, ongoing compliance with government regulations, employee and employer reporting, participant and employer online access, electronic funds transfer, and other administrative services. Auto enrollment is an optional plan feature that allows employers to automatically enroll employees in their company&#8217;s 401(k) plan and increase overall plan participation. Clients have the ability to choose from a group of pre-defined fund selections or to customize their investment options within their plan. We are the largest 401(k) recordkeeper for small businesses in the U.S. Our large-market retirement services clients include relationships with financi al advisors. As of May 31, 2016 , retirement s ervices covered approximately 74 ,000 plans and the asset value of participants' funds externally man aged totaled approximately $23.6 billion. 

&#183; 

Insurance services: Our licensed insurance agency, PIA , provides insurance through a variety of carriers. Insurance offerings include property and casualty coverage such as workers&#8217; compensation, business-owner policies, commercial auto, and health and benefits coverage, including health, dental, vision, and life. Our insurance services simplify the insurance process to make it easy to find plans with the features and affordability to meet the client&#8217;s needs. With access to numerous top national and regional insurance carriers, our professional insurance agents have access to a wide selection of plans from which they can best match the insurance needs of small businesses. Additionally, clients have the option to integrate their insurance plans with Paychex payroll processing for easy, accurate plan administration. 

We also offer new comprehensive solutions to help employers and employees with certain mandates under the Affordable &#160; C are Act (&#8220;ACA&#8221;), which sets forth specific coverage and reporting requirements that employers must meet . Our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility (&#8220;ESR&#8221;) Service is aimed at helping clients: 1) determine if the ESR provision applies to them; 2) provide ongoing ESR analysis and monitoring, along with automatic alerts, of their employees and hours worked; 3) evaluate if their health care offering meets the minimum coverage requirement; and 4) prepare end-of-year reporting. 

PIA has a website, www.paychexinsurance.com , with information and interactive tools to help educate visitors on insurance and aid in making business insurance decisions. A section on this website is designed to provide answers, information, and solutions that employers can use to prepare for and take action to comply with health care reform. 

&#160;

&#183; 

HR administration services: We offer cloud-based human resource administration software products for employee benefits management and administration, time and attendance solutions, and recruiting. Paychex HR Online offers powerful tools for managing employee benefits, personnel information, and human resource compliance and reporting. Our BeneTrac service manages the employee-benefit enrollment process. Our time and attendance products, including our Stratustime &#174; software acquired in June 2014, help minimize the time spent compiling time sheet information. These services allow the employer to handle multiple payroll scenarios, improving productivity, accuracy, and reliability in the payroll process. Our expense reporting solution is a web-based solution that provides clients with tools to manage and control the expense reporting process. The applicant tracking suite provides technology that streamlines, simplifies, and drives the applicant workflow and onboarding process for companies of all sizes. 

&#183; 

Other human resource services and products: We offer the outsourcing of plan administration under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code, allowing employees to use pre-tax dollars to pay for certain health insurance benefits and health and dependent care expenses not covered by insurance. All required implementation, administration, compliance, claims processing and reimbursement, and coverage tests are provided with these services. We offer state unemployment insurance services, which provide clients with prompt processing for all claims, appeals, determinations, change statements, and requests for separation documents. Other HRS products include employee handbooks, management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms. These products are designed to simplify clients&#8217; office processes and enhance their employee benefits programs. 

Accounting and Financial Services: We offer various accounting and financial services to small- to medium-sized businesses. These services offer additional value-added benefits for small-business owners including: &#160; purchasing of accounts receivable as a means of providing funding to clients in the temporary staffing industry; a cloud-based accounting service ; payment processing services ; payment distribution services ; an d a small-business loan resource center. 

Sales and Marketing 

We market and sell our services primarily through our direct sales force based in the metropolitan markets we serve. Our direct sales force includes sales representatives who have defined geographical territories and specialize within our portfolio of services. Within payroll , we differentiate the markets we serve between small-business and mid-market companies. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing programs. We utilize a virtual sales force to service geographical areas where we may not have a local presence or for products for which we do not have a local sales force. We sell HRS products to both new clients and our existing client base. 

In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize other indirect sales channels such as our relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (&#8220;CPAs&#8221;), and banks for new client referrals. Approximately 50% of our new core payroll clients (excluding business acquisitions) come from these referral sources. Our dedicated business development group drives sales through banking, national association s , and franchise channels. 

We have a long-standing partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (&#8220;AICPA&#8221;) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business Solutions TM Program. More than half of the CPA firms in the U.S. are enrolled and actively participating in the Paychex Partner Program from AICPA Business Solutions. Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in p lace through September 2021 . We also partner with various state CPA society organizations. 

Our website, which is available at www.paychex.com , includes online payroll sales presentations and service and product information. It also serves as a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct sales force. This online tool allows us to market to clients and prospective clients in other geographical areas where we do not have a direct sales presence. In addition, our insurance services website, which is available at www.paychexinsurance.com , provides information to help small businesses navigate the insurance industry, and generates leads by allowing interested parties to get in contact with one of our professional insurance agents. 

Paychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the HCM industry by providing education and assistance to clients and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impacts of regulatory change. We track current regulatory issues that impact the small business community and provide a monthly regulatory update. Our Paychex Accountant Knowledge Center is a free online resource available through our website that brings valuable information and time-saving online tools to accounting professionals. The BuildMyBiz &#174; website, which is available at www.BuildMyBiz.com , provides tools and resources for starting, growing, and managing a business. 

&#160;

Markets and Competition 

We remain focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Our internal database source indicates that there are approximately 11 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the U.S. Of those businesses, approximately 99% have fewer than 100 employees and comprise our primary customers and target market. The average client size within our existing client base is approximately 16.7 employees. We believe that there is opportunity for us in the HCM market as the demand is moving down-market to smaller businesses. 

We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the U.S. and in Germany. Revenue from operations in Germany and long-lived assets in Germany are not material. We also have a joint-venture arrangement to provide payroll and human resource services in Brazil. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice. For th e fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 (&#8220;fiscal 2016 &#8221;), client retention was in excess of 82% of our beginning of the year client base , consistent with the prior year&#8217;s record high . No single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations. 

The market for HCM services is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of which we believe have significantly fewer clients than us. In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and human resource systems and departments. Payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors. HRS products also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, and human resources and benefits consulting firms. 

Competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness, product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of service and product offerings, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas. We believe that our excellent customer service, together with our leading-edge technology and mobility applications, distinguishes us from our competitors. 

Software Maintenance and Development 

The ever-changing mandates of F ederal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update our proprietary software to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace. We continue to enhance our SaaS solutions and mobility applications to offer our users an integrated and unified experience. Continued enhancement of the client and client employee experience is important to our future success. 

Employees 

As of May 31, 2016, we employed approximately 13,5 00 people. None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 

Intellectual Property 

We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the &#8220;Paychex&#8221; name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us. 

Seasonality 

There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new Paychex HR Services worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional year-end services. Historically, as a result of these factors, our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter, with greater sales commission expenses also reported in that quarter. 

&#160;
