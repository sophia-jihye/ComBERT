BUSINESS 

General 

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of our pipeline of new oncology therapeutics for the potential treatment of solid and hematologic cancers. Our most advanced program is QINPREZO TM (vosaroxin), our product candidate for the potential treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. Vosaroxin is an anticancer quinolone derivative, or AQD&#8212;a class of compounds that has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer. We have built a highly experienced cancer drug development organization committed to advancing vosaroxin in multiple indications to improve the lives of people with cancer. 

In October 2014, we announced the results of a Phase 3, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, or the VALOR trial. Detailed results of the VALOR trial were presented in the "Late Breaking Abstracts" session of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2014 and additionally published in the September 2015 issue of The Lancet Oncology.

The VALOR trial did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, but based upon the favorable results of other predefined analyses of the data, in November 2014, we submitted a letter of intent to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, describing our intention to file a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for marketing authorization of vosaroxin plus cytarabine for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. In June 2015, we met separately with our Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur, who are two appointed members of the EMA&#8217;s Committee of Human Medicinal Products. Based upon feedback from these meetings, we filed an MAA with the EMA at the end of 2015. In July 2015, we met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to discuss a potential regulatory filing in the U.S. Based upon the meeting, the FDA recommended that we provide additional clinical evidence prior to any regulatory filing in the U.S . As a result, we are evaluating regulatory and clinical strategies with the goal of gaining future marketing approval in the U.S.

In the second half of 2013, we announced the initiation of three Phase 1/2 investigator-sponsored trials of vosaroxin, either as a standalone therapy or in combination with approved compounds, in various indications of AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. The trials are being conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, or MDAC C, Weill Cornell Medical College and New York-Presbyterian Hospital, and the Washington University School of Medicine, or Washington University. 

In December 2015, preliminary results from the ongoing Phase 1b/2 MDACC-sponsored trial of vosaroxin in combination with decitabine in older patients with previously untreated AML and high-risk MDS and the ongoing Phase 1b/2 Washington University-sponsored trial of vosaroxin in combination with azacitidine in patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome were presented at the ASH Annual Meeting. 

We own worldwide development and commercialization rights to vosaroxin. In 2009, vosaroxin received orphan drug designation for the treatment of AML from the FDA and in 2012, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of AML, which may provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity in all member countries of the European Union following a product approval for this indication in Europe. In 2011, the FDA granted fast track designation to vosaroxin for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in combination with cytarabine. We have been granted, or notified of allowance of, a number of key patents for vosaroxin, details of which are provided in the &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221; section below. 

In January 2014, we announced the expansion of our oncology pipeline through separate global licensing agreements for two preclinical kinase inhibitor programs. The first agreement, with Biogen Idec MA, Inc., or Biogen Idec, is for global commercial rights to SNS-062, a selective non-covalently binding oral inhibitor of BTK. We filed a Clinical Trial Authorization, or CTA, application with the EMA in the first quarter of 2016 to support a Phase 1A study of SNS-062 in healthy volunteers.

The second agreement, with Milennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, is for global commercial rights to several potential first-in class, pre-clinical inhibitors of the novel target PDK1. In 2014, we selected two PDK1 inhibitors, SNS-229 and SNS-510, of which we have taken one, SNS-229 into IND-enabling absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, or ADME, and safety studies.

Both BTK and PDK1 programs were originally developed under a research collaboration agreement between Biogen Idec and Sunesis. In 2011, the PDK1 program was purchased by and exclusively licensed to Takeda along with the more advanced program, TAK-580 (formerly MLN2480), an oral pan-RAF inhibitor, for which Takeda recently initiated a multi-arm, open-label Phase 1B study in combination with MLN0128, an oral mTORC 1/2 inhibitor; alisertib, an oral aurora A kinase inhibitor; or paclitaxel, in adult patients with advanced non-hematologic malignancies. In November 2015, we presented the preclinical data from the BTK and PDK1 Inhibitor Programs at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics. We currently expect SNS-062 and SNS-229 will be developed exclusively by Sunesis for the foreseeable future.

Our Strategy 

We plan to continue to build Sunesis into a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new oncology therapeutics for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers by: 

&#160;

&#183; 

pursuing regulatory approval for vosaroxin as a potential treatment for relapsed or refractory AML in Europe, the United States, and other major markets; 

&#160;

&#183; 

leveraging potential partners and distributors to commercialize vosaroxin in selective international markets, if approved; 

&#160;

&#183; 

establishing vosaroxin as the new standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory AML; 

&#160;

&#183; 

exploring the broader potential of vosaroxin, beyond our pivotal indication, in different patient segments within AML and MDS through investigator sponsored trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

investing in additional clinical testing to evaluate vosaroxin for additional AML indications, MDS, other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors; 

&#160;

&#183; 

leveraging our strong intellectual property protection over vosaroxin to capitalize on its full potential; 

&#160;

&#183; 

supporting our multi-kinase inhibitor programs with Takeda in oncology and Biogen Idec for immunology indications; 

&#160;

&#183; 

conducting a Phase 1a study in healthy volunteers for our BTK inhibitor, SNS-062; 

&#160;

&#183; 

conducting ADME and safety studies with our PDK1 inhibitor, SNS-229 in 2016; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

continuing to expand and develop our oncology-focused pipeline through further licensing or collaboration arrangements and research and development. 

Development Pipeline 

The following chart summarizes our development pipeline: 

&#160;

Vosaroxin 

Background. Vosaroxin is an AQD&#8212;a class of compounds that has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer. Preclinical data demonstrate that vosaroxin both intercalates DNA and inhibits topoisomerase II, an enzyme critical for cell replication, resulting in replication-dependent, site-selective DNA damage, G2 arrest and apoptosis. We licensed worldwide development and commercialization rights to vosaroxin from Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd., or Sumitomo, in 2003. 

Mechanism of Action. The molecular core of vosaroxin is structurally similar to quinolones and distinct from anthracyclines and anthracenediones. Vosaroxin's anticancer activity results from apoptosis caused exclusively by DNA intercalation, inhibition of topoisomerase II, and cell cycle inhibition in replicating cells. 

Vosaroxin&#8217;s cytotoxic activity is established in diverse human tumors and clinical activity is observed in both solid and hematologic malignancies. In preclinical studies, vosaroxin demonstrated broad antitumor activity and exhibited additive or synergistic activity when combined with several therapeutic agents currently used in the treatment of cancer, including cytarabine. Vosaroxin maintains activity in drug resistant tumor cell lines and human tumor models. Vosaroxin evades P-gp transporter-mediated resistance, and its activity is p53 independent, reducing resistance to therapy. Vosaroxin has demonstrated anticancer activity in patients who have failed other topoisomerase II inhibitor treatment.

Development Opportunity. Our goal is to establish vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine as the standard of care for pa tients with relapsed or refractory AML. Additionally, we are exploring the broader potential of vosaroxin in different patient segments within AML and MDS through investigator-sponsored trials. Based on the outcome of regulatory interactions related to our VALOR trial, the results of investigator-sponsored trials, competitive concerns, our financial resources and various other factors, we may further invest in the development and clinical testing of vosaroxin for related disease areas and indications such a s other AML populations, MDS, other hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 

Vosaroxin Company-Sponsored Clinical Trials in AML 

VALOR. In December 2010, we commenced enrollment of the VALOR trial, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal clinical trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine to evaluate overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. The trial, which enrolled 711 adult patients, was conducted at 124 study sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Patients were stratified for age, geographic region and disease status and randomized one to one to receive either vosaroxin and cytarabine or placebo and cytarabine. In October 2014, we announced the results from the VALOR trial, and further detail was presented in the "Late Breaking Abstracts" session of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2014 and additionally published in the September 2015 issue of The Lancet Oncology . 

Patients treated with vosaroxin achieved increased overall survival compared to those treated with placebo (7.5 months vs 6.1 months, HR=0.87), the primary endpoint, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.06). The complete remission (CR) rate, the sole secondary efficacy endpoint in the trial, did demonstrate a significant difference for the vosaroxin combination arm (30.1% vs 16.3%, p &#60; 0.0001).

In a pre-planned analysis accounting for the stratification factors at randomization, a significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated (HR=0.83, p=0.02). The pre-planned analysis of all treatment strata included the following poor-prognosis patient categories: over 60 years old (7.1 months vs 5.0 months, HR=0.75, p=0.003, n=451), refractory disease (6.7 months vs 5.0 months, HR=0.87, p=0.23, n=301), and early relapsed disease (6.7 months vs 5.2 months, HR=0.77, p=0.04, n=256). Outcomes in patients under 60 years old or with late relapsed disease were comparable between treatment arms, with no improvement in overall survival. Across all strata, the CR and Composite CR (CR+CRp+CRi) rates were higher in the vosaroxin combination arm.

Given the complexity of interpreting the impact of transplantation therapy, a predefined analysis of overall survival censoring for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was planned. In this analysis, patients receiving the vosaroxin combination had a median overall survival of 6.7 months versus 5.3 months for patients receiving placebo and cytarabine (HR=0.81, p=0.02). 

Regarding drug safety, Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse events that were more common in the vosaroxin combination arm were gastrointestinal and infection-related toxicities, consistent with those observed in our previous clinical trials. The rate of serious adverse events was 55.5% in the vosaroxin combination arm compared to 35.7% in the placebo and cytarabine arm. 30-day and 60-day all-cause mortality were comparable between the trial arms (7.9% versus 6.6% and 19.7% versus 19.4%, for the vosaroxin combination versus placebo and cytarabine, respectively).

Phase 2 Combination. The results from our completed Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory AML were published in the November 7, 2014 Ahead of Print issue of Haematologica. The article, titled &#8220;A Phase 1b/2 study of combination vosaroxin and cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia,&#8221; is available online at: http://www.haematologica.org/content/early/recent . 

The Phase 1b/2 study assessed the safety and tolerability of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Escalating vosaroxin doses (10-minute infusion; 10-90 mg/m 2 on days 1, 4) were given in combination with cytarabine on one of two schedules: schedule A (24-hour continuous intravenous infusion, 400 mg/m 2 per day on days 1-5) or schedule B (2-hour intravenous infusion, 1 g/m 2 per day on days 1-5). Following dose escalation, enrollment was expanded at the maximum tolerated dose. The maximum tolerated dose for schedule A was vosaroxin 80 mg/m 2 (dose-limiting toxicities: grade 3 bowel obstruction and stomatitis); the maximum tolerated dose was not reached for schedule B (recommended phase 2 dose: 90 mg/m 2 ).

The median age in the study was 60 years, and patients had received as many as six prior cycles of therapy. Furthermore, most patients (89%) had intermediate or unfavorable cytogenetic risk status. The most common treatment-emergent non-hematologic adverse events of any grade were diarrhea, hypokalemia, nausea, and stomatitis. In the efficacy population, (all first relapsed or primary refractory patients treated with vosaroxin 80-90 mg/m 2 ; n=69), the CR and combined CR rates (CR or CR with incomplete blood count recovery) were 25% and 28%, respectively. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 2.5% among all patients treated at 80-90 mg/m 2 . 

Phase 2 Single-Agent. The results from our completed Response Evaluation of Vosaroxin in Elderly AmL (REVEAL-1) trial, a Phase 2 trial of single agent vosaroxin in previously untreated, poor-risk elderly AML patients who are unlikely to benefit from standard induction chemotherapy, were published in the November 17, 2014 Online Version of Record of the British Journal of Haematology . The article, titled "REVEAL-1, a phase 2 dose regimen optimization study of vosaroxin in older poor-risk patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia," is available online at: http://online library.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjh.13214/abstract . 

The REVEAL-1 trial evaluated single-agent vosaroxin in patients &#8805;60 years of age (n=113) with previously untreated unfavorable prognosis AML. Dose regimen optimization was explored in sequential cohorts (A: 72 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, 15; B: 72 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8; C: 72 mg/m 2 or 90 mg/m 2 on days 1, 4). The primary efficacy endpoint was combined complete remission rate (CR plus CR with incomplete platelet recovery, or CRp). The median age in the study was 75 years and most patients (82%) had 2 or more risk factors (age &#8805; 70, antecedent hematologic disease, ECOG PS=2, or intermediate/unfavorable cytogenetics).

Common (&#62;20%) grade &#8805;3 adverse events were thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, anemia, neutropenia, sepsis, pneumonia, stomatitis, and hypokalemia. Overall CR and CR/CRp rates were 29% and 32%; median overall survival, or OS, was 7.0 months; 1-year OS was 34%. Schedule C (72 mg/m 2 ) had the most favorable balance of safety and efficacy, with faster hematologic recovery (median 27 days) and lowest incidence of aggregate sepsis (24%) and 30-day (7%) and 60-day (17%) all-cause mortality. At this dose and schedule, CR and CR/CRp rates were 31% and 35%, median OS was 7.7 months, and 1-year OS was 38%.

Phase 1 Single-Agent. Prior to 2009, we conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary clinical activity of two dose schedules of vosaroxin in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia. Anti-leukemic activity was observed in both schedules, and the most common dose-limiting toxicity was stomatitis. The maximum tolerated dose was 72 mg/m 2 for a once weekly for three weeks schedule and 40 mg/m 2 for a twice weekly for two weeks schedule. 

Vosaroxin Company-Sponsored Clinical Trials in Ovarian Cancer and Other Solid Tumors 

In 2010, we completed a Phase 2 single-agent trial of vosaroxin in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Three dosing levels in two treatment schedules were studied, and encouraging, durable anti-tumor activity was observed across all doses. For patients on dosing levels of 48, 60 and 75 mg/m 2 , the overall response rate, or ORR, was 11%, 11% and 9%, respectively; disease control, defined as stable disease for 12 weeks or more, was 46%, 46% and 51%, respectively; and the median progression-free survival, or PFS, was 83, 61 and 103 days, respectively. Based on clinical activity and tolerability, the 60 mg/m 2 dose and schedule was selected for future consideration. Overall, vosaroxin was generally well tolerated, with more than 10% of patients experiencing severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and anemia. 

Prior to 2009, we conducted two Phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate different dosing schedules of vosaroxin in patients with advanced solid tumors. We also conducted two Phase 2 trials in non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Although objective responses were observed in both lung cancer trials, it was determined that vosaroxin could be administered with greater dose intensity given the low incidence of severe neutropenia and the trials were halted. 

Vosaroxin Investigator Sponsored Clinical Trials 

MD Anderson. In July 2013, we announced the initiation of an investigator-sponsored trial of vosaroxin in combination with decitabine in older patients with previously untreated AML and high-risk MDS. The Phase 1/2 trial is being conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center under the direction of Naval Daver, M.D., Assistant Professor, and Farhad Ravandi, M.D., Professor of Medicine and a principal investigator in the VALOR trial. The primary endpoints of the Phase 1 cohort of the study are to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and dose limiting toxicity, or DLT, of vosaroxin in combination with decitabine in patients with high-risk MDS or AML who are elderly and/or unable or unwilling to receive standard cytarabine plus anthracycline based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 cohort of the study is to determine the efficacy of the combination based on achievement of CR, and CR with incomplete blood count recovery, or CRi. Secondary endpoints include safety, CR duration, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival. In October 2013, we announced the commencement of the Phase 2 portion of the study. In December 2015, updated results from this study were presented at the ASH Annual Meeting. 

Weill Cornell. In October 2013, we announced the initiation of a second investigator-sponsored trial of vosaroxin in adult patients wi th previously treated intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS. The trial is being conducted at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York-Presbyterian Hospital under the direction of Gail J. Roboz, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of the Leukemia Program. The Phase 1/2, open-label, dose escalating trial is expected to enroll up to 40 patients with MDS who have previously failed treatment with hypomethylating agent-based therapy. Patient cohorts will initially receive escalating doses of vosaroxin over each 28 day treatment cycle. Once the MTD is determined, an expanded evaluation of safety and hematologic response or improvement rate at this dose level will be conducted in additional subjects, so that the total number of subjects exposed to this do se level increases to up to 15 subjects. In addition to MTD and DLT, study endpoints include the rate of complete remission, partial remission, hematologic improvement and blood transfusion requirements. 

Washington University. In December 2013, we announced the initiation of a third investigator-sponsored trial of vosaroxin in combination with azacitidine in patients with MDS. The trial is being conducted at the Washington University School of Medicine under the direction of Meagan A. Jacoby, M.D., Ph.D., Instructor of Medicine, Division of Oncology. The Phase 1/2, open label, dose-escalation trial will enroll up to approximately 40 patients with MDS who may have received up to three prior cycles of hypomethylating agent-based therapy. Patients will receive vosaroxin (days one and four) and azacitidine (days one through seven) for a maximum of six cycles. This dose escalation study is designed to enroll six patients per cohort in order to determine the MTD and DLT of the combination. Other endpoints include best response, safety, tolerability, and event-free, progression-free, disease-free and overall survival. Once the MTD is determined, up to an additional 20 patients will be enrolled, treated and evaluated at that dose level. In December 2015, we announced the preliminary results from the first 16 patients enrolled in this study at the ASH annual meeting. 

Cardiff University School of Medicine. In December 2011, we announced our participation in the randomized Phase 2/3 Less Intensive 1 (LI-1) Study being conducted by the United Kingdom's National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Haematological Oncology Study Group under the direction of Professor Alan K. Burnett, Head of Haematology, Department of Medical Genetics, Haematology &#38; Pathology at Cardiff University School of Medicine. The trial enrolled patients over the age of 60 with AML or high-risk MDS and randomized them to one of a number of treatment regimens: Low Dose Ara-C (control); single-agent vosaroxin; vosaroxin combined with Low Dose Ara-C; or to other experimental therapies considered for inclusion in the comparison. In 2013, at the first interim analyses, the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee recommended closure of the vosaroxin-containing trial arms as a clinically relevant benefit was unlikely. 

TAK-280 (formerly MLN2480) 

Background. A pan-Raf inhibitor program was originally developed through a collaboration agreement between Sunesis and Biogen Idec. In March 2011, Biogen Idec&#8217;s rights to this program were purchased by and exclusively licensed to Takeda. In September 2011, Takeda initiated a Phase 1 clinical study of TAK-580, an oral, investigative drug selective for pan-Raf kinase inhibition, in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. The Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and MTD of TAK-580, and to be conducted in two stages: dose escalation and cohort expansion. The dose escalation stage is complete and MTD was established, and TAK-580 is now in the cohort expansion stage of this multicenter study. Four abstracts of preclinical and clinical data of TAK-580 were presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in November 2014. 

Under the license agreement, we may in the future receive up to $57.5 million in pre-commercialization, event-based payments related to the development by Takeda of the first two indications for each of the licensed products directed against the Raf target, and royalty payments depending on related product sales, as further described below. 

Mechanism of Action. The Raf kinases (A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf) are key regulators of cell proliferation and survival within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. 

Development Opportunity. TAK-580 is a pan-Raf kinase inhibitor with a distinct molecular signature which has exhibited a promising profile. 

SNS-062 

Background. SNS-062 is a non-covalently binding inhibitor of BTK. BTK mediates signaling through the B-cell receptor, or BCR, which is critical for adhesion, migration, proliferation and survival of normal and malignant B-lineage lymphoid cells. BTK has been well validated as a target for treatment of B-cell malignancies, with a BTK inhibitor approved for relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma, relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, CLL with 17p depletion and Waldenstr&#246;m&#8217;s macroglobulinemia . In 2015, we conducting IND-enabling studies for SNS-062, with a view to filing a CTA application to conduct a Phase 1a healthy volunteer study in Belgium. The rights to develop SNS-062 for oncology indications were in-licensed from Biogen Idec in December 2013, as described below. 

Mechanism of Action. SNS-062 has activity in B TK kinase assays and has shown efficacy in B-cell signaling assays and in vivo models of B-cell function. The mechanism by which SNS-062 inhibits BTK is distinct from the mechanism of in-class BTK compounds, as SNS-062 binds BTK non-covalently, which does not require interaction with Cysteine 481 in the kinase active domain. In addition, SNS-062 has a distinct kinase inhibitory profile and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile compared to covalently binding BTK inhibitors and this may translate into a distinc t clinical benefit for patients. 

Development Opportunity. SNS-062 has demonstrated a distinct binding site and favorable pharmacokinetic profile in preclinical studies, and may provide differentiated opportunities for treatment of B-cell malignancies and other blood cancers. 

SNS-229 and SNS-510

Background. In January 2014, we in-licensed a series of selective PDK1 inhibitors from Takeda that were discovered under a research collaboration agreement between Biogen Idec and Sunesis, as described below. PDK1 is a key kinase and mediator of PI3K/AKT signaling, a pathway involved in cell growth, differentiation, survival and migration. PDK1 inhibitors are expected to have unique effects on survival and invasion signaling and to be broadly active in both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. We have taken a series of PDK1 inhibitors with confirmed antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo into preclinical development, and in 2014, we selected two PDK1 inhibitors, SNS-229 and SNS-510, of which we have now taken one, SNS-229 into IND-enabling ADME and safety studies. 

Mechanism of Action. There are multiple PI3K pathway inhibitors in late stage development for use in CLL and solid tumor indications, including breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. Because PDK1-dependent activation of AKT is critical for PI3K pathway activation, we believe that PDK1 represents a key oncology target within the PI3K pathway. We believe Sunesis&#8217; PDK1 inhibitors are potential first-in-class compounds with demonstrated inhibition of AKT activity and a compelling in vitro and in vivo profile, that have potential for single agent and broad-spectrum combination activity, thus providing a novel therapeutic opportunity for targeting the PI3K signaling pathway in both solid and hematologic malignancies. 

Development Opportunity. Inhibitors of PDK1 are expected to be able to provide similar clinical benefits to those observed with PI3K inhibitors and have the potential to provide additional benefits through inhibition of PI3K independent cancer signaling pathways, especially in cancer types in which PDK1 is overexpressed such as breast cancer and AML. We believe that Sunesis&#8217; PDK1 inhibitors can be differentiated from PI3K and PDK1 inhibitors currently in research and development and that may provide novel opportunities for treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. 

License, Collaboration and Royalty Agreements 

Inlicense Agreement with Sumitomo 

In October 2003, we entered into an agreement with Sumitomo to acquire exclusive worldwide development and marketing rights for vosaroxin. In January 2011, we made a $0.5 million milestone payment to Sumitomo as a result of the initiation of our VALOR trial in December 2010. In January 2016, we made an additional $0.5 million milestone payment to Sumitomo as a result of the filing of our MAA. In the future we may be required to make additional milestone payments of up to $7.0 million in aggregate to Sumitomo for (a) filing NDAs, in the U.S. and Japan, and (b) for receiving regulatory approvals in these regions and the EU, for cancer-related indications. If vosaroxin is approved for a non-cancer indication, an additional milestone payment will become payable to Sumitomo. 

The agreement also provides for royalty payments to Sumitomo at rates based on total annual net sales. Under the agreement, we may reduce our royalty payments to Sumitomo if a third party markets a competitive product and we must pay royalties for third-party intellectual property rights necessary to commercialize vosaroxin. Royalty obligations under the agreement continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of the date on which no valid patent claims relating to a product exist or 10 years from the date of the first sale of the product. 

If we discontinue seeking regulatory approval and/or the sale of the product in a region, we are required to return its rights to the product in that region to Sumitomo. The agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party&#8217;s uncured breach or bankruptcy. 

L icensing and Collaboration Agreements with Biogen Idec and Takeda 

Overview 

In August 2004, we entered into the original collaboration agreement with Biogen Idec to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule inhibitors of the human protein Raf kinase, including family members Raf-1, A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf, collectively Raf, and up to five additional targets that play a role in oncology and immunology indications such as BTK and PDK1, or the Biogen Idec OCA. 

In June 2008, the parties agreed to terminate the research term and related funding as of June 30, 2008. A total of $20.0 million of research funding was received through that date. We received a total of $3.0 million in milestone payments for meeting certain preclinical milestones through the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA date, as described below, including a $1.5 million event-based payment received in cash in July 2009 for Biogen Idec&#8217;s selection of a Raf kinase inhibitor development candidate for the treatment of cancer. 

In March 2011, as part of a series of agreements among Sunesis, Biogen Idec and Takeda, we entered into: (a) an amended and restated collaboration agreement with Biogen Idec, or the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA; (b) a license agreement with Millennium, or the Takeda Agreement; and (c) a termination and transition agreement among the Sunesis, Biogen Idec and Takeda, or the Termination and Transition Agreement. 

The Termination and Transition Agreement provided for (a) the termination of Biogen Idec&#8217;s exclusive rights under the Biogen Idec OCA to all discovery programs under such agreement other than for small molecule inhibitors of the human protein BTK; (b) the permitted assignment to Takeda of all related Sunesis collaboration assets and rights to Raf kinase and the human protein PDK1; and (c) the payment of $4.0 million to us from Takeda, which was recorded as revenue in March 2011. 

Biogen Idec 

The Biogen Idec 1st ARCA amended and restated the Biogen Idec OCA, to provide for the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule BTK inhibitors. Under this agreement, we no longer have research obligations, but licenses granted to Biogen Idec with respect to the research collaboration under the Biogen Idec OCA (other than the licenses transferred to Takeda under the Takeda Agreement) remain in effect. 

In June 2012, we received an event-based payment of $1.5 million from Biogen Idec for its advancement of pre-clinical work in connection with the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA. Under this agreement, we are eligible to receive up to an additional $58.5 million in pre-commercialization, event-based payments related to the development by Biogen Idec of the first two indications for licensed products against the BTK target. We are also eligible to receive royalty payments depending on related product sales, which may be increased if we exercise our option to co-fund product candidates worldwide. 

In December 2013, we entered into a second amended and restated collaboration agreement with Biogen Idec, or the Biogen Idec 2nd ARCA, which amended and restated the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA, to provide us with an exclusive worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize SNS-062, a BTK inhibitor synthesized under the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA, solely for oncology indications. Under the Biogen Idec 2nd ARCA, we may be required to make a $2.5 million milestone payment depending on our development of SNS-062 and royalty payments depending on related product sales of SNS-062. Additionally, potential future royalty payments to Sunesis were reduced to equal those amounts due to Biogen Idec for potential future sales of SNS-062. All other of Sunesis&#8217; rights contained in the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA remain unchanged. 

Takeda 

Under the Takeda Agreement, we granted exclusive licenses to products against two oncology targets originally developed under the Biogen Idec OCA, Raf and PDK1, under substantially the same terms as under the Biogen Idec OCA. 

In January 2014, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Takeda, or the Amended Takeda Agreement, to provide us with an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize preclinical inhibitors of PDK1. In connection with execution of the Amended Takeda Agreement, we paid an upfront fee and may in the future be required to make up to $9.2 million in pre-commercialization milestone payments depending on our development of PDK1 inhibitors and royalty payments depending on related product sales. 

With respect to the Raf target product rights that were originally licensed to Takeda under the Takeda Agreement, we may in the future receive up to $57.5 million in pre-commercialization, event-based payments related to the development by Takeda of the first two indicat ions for each of the licensed products directed against the Raf target and royalty payments depending on related product sales. The agreement also provides us with future co-development and co-promotion rights. Takeda is currently conducting a Phase 1 clin ical study of an oral investigative drug, TAK-580, which is licensed to them under the Amended Takeda Agreement. 

Royalty Agreement with RPI 

In March 2012, we entered into a Revenue Participation Agreement, or the Royalty Agreement, with RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, an entity related to Royalty Pharma. In September 2012, as a result of the recommendation by the DSMB to increase the sample size for the VALOR trial, RPI made a $25.0 million cash payment to us in exchange for a 6.75% royalty on any future net sales of vosaroxin. In conjunction with the Royalty Agreement, we issued two five-year warrants to RPI, each to purchase 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, at exercise prices of $3.48 and $4.64 per share, respectively. Of the $25.0 million, $21.9 million was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to revenue over the related performance period of the Royalty Agreement. The remaining $3.1 million represents the fair value of the warrants. Both warrants were exercised in full in 2014.

Revenues 

Over the past three years, we have generated revenue through the Royalty Agreement with RPI and the Biogen Idec 1st ARCA. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized $2.9 million, $5.7 million and $8.0 million of revenue, respectively, related to the Royalty Agreement with RPI. 

Manufacturing 

We do not have internal manufacturing capabilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of vosaroxin. To date, we have relied on, and we expect to continue to rely on, a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of the vosaroxin active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and the finished drug product incorporating the API, or FDP. We do not have commercial supply agreements with any of these third parties, and our agreements with these parties may include provisions that allow for termination at will by either party following a relatively short notice period. 

We currently rely on two contract manufacturers for the vosaroxin API. We also currently rely on a single contract manufacturer to formulate the vosaroxin API and fill and finish vials of the vosaroxin FDP. Because the vosaroxin API is classified as a cytotoxic substance, the number of available manufacturers for the API and FDP is limited. We believe at least five contract manufacturers in North America have suitable facilities to manufacture the vosaroxin API, and at least four have suitable facilities to manufacture the vosaroxin FDP. A number of manufacturers outside of North America have suitable facilities, including one that currently manufactures our vosaroxin API. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the vosaroxin API and FDP from our current manufacturers, it may take time to engage alternative manufacturers, which could delay the development of and impair our ability to commercialize vosaroxin. 

To date, vosaroxin has been manufactured in quantities appropriate for preclinical studies and clinical trials, including the manufacture of registration batches of API and FDP. Prior to commercial sale, we will need to perform process validation studies on API and FDP batches. If the results of these process validation studies do not meet preset criteria, the regulatory approval or commercial launch of vosaroxin may be delayed. 

Competition 

The life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching, developing and marketing products designed to address the treatment of cancer, including AML, MDS and B-cell malignancies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in the clinical testing of, obtaining regulatory approvals for, and marketing drugs. 

We believe that our ability to successfully compete in the marketplace with vosaroxin and any future product candidates will depend on, among other things: 

&#160;

&#183; 

our ability to develop novel compounds with attractive pharmaceutical properties and to secure, protect and maintain intellectual property rights based on our innovations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the efficacy, safety and reliability of our product candidates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the speed at which we develop our product candidates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our ability to maintain a good relationship with regulatory authorities; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our ability to obtain, and the timing and scope of, regulatory approvals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of future products to the market; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the availability of reimbursement from government agencies and private insurance companies; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

acceptance of future products by physicians and other healthcare providers. 

Vosaroxin is a small molecule therapeutic that, if approved, will compete with other drugs and therapies currently used for AML, such as nucleoside analogs, anthracyclines, hypomethylating agents, other inhibitors of topoisomerase II, and other novel agents. Additionally, other compounds currently in development could become potential competitors of vosaroxin, if approved for marketing. We expect competition with vosaroxin for the treatment of AML and other potential future indications to increase as additional products are developed and approved for use in various patient populations. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that patent protection is very important to our business and that our future success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents protecting vosaroxin or future drug candidates, if any. Historically, we have patented a wide range of technology, inventions and improvements related to our business, some of which we are no longer actively developing. 

U.S. Patent No. 5,817,669 B2 covering the vosaroxin composition-of-matter and its counterpart patents in 43 foreign jurisdictions have all expired . While it is possible that patent term restoration and/or supplemental patent certificates would be available for some of these or other patents we own or control through licenses, we cannot guarantee that such additional protection will be obtained, and the expiration dates described here do not include such term restoration. 

We have also been granted patents relating to vosaroxin compositions, and uses and manufacture of vosaroxin, in the U.S.: 

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. Patent No. 7,989,468 B2 claims methods of use of vosaroxin at clinically relevant dose ranges and schedules for the treatment of leukemia, with expiry in 2026; 

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. Patent Nos. 7,829,577 B2 and 8,669,270 B2 claim certain pharmaceutical compositions of vosaroxin, including the formulation used in our VALOR trial, with expiry in 2025; 

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. Patent No. 8,580,814 B2 claims certain methods of use of vosaroxin at clinically relevant dose ranges to treat acute myelogenous leukemia, with expiry in 2026; 

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. Patent No. 8,822,493 B2 claims certain methods of use of vosaroxin at clinically relevant dose ranges together with therapeutically effective amounts of cytarabine to treat cancer, with expiry in 2024; 

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. 8,124,773 B2 claims a hydrate of vosaroxin with expiry in 2028 and U.S. Patent No. 8,765,954 B2 claims certain compositions containing this hydrate of vosaroxin, with expiry in 2027; 

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. Patent No. 8,497,282 B2 claims a method of making vosaroxin, with expiry in 2031 and U.S. Patent No. 8,802,719 B2 claims certain intermediates useful in the making of vosaroxin, with expiry in 2029; 

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. Patent Nos. 8,586,601 B2 and 8,138,202 B2 claim certain compositions containing vosaroxin, with expiry in 2030; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. Patent No. 7,968,565 B2 claims a combination of vosaroxin and cytarabine, with expiry in 2026. 

We have also been granted patents relating to vosaroxin compositions, and uses and manufacture of vosaroxin, in Europe: 

&#160;

&#183; 

EPO Patent No. 1725233 B1, which has been validated in multiple EPO member states, claims certain pharmaceutical compositions of vosaroxin, including the formulation used in our VALOR trial, with expiry in 2025; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

EPO Patent No. 1729770 B1, which has been validated in multiple EPO member states, claims combinations of vosaroxin and certain anticancer agents, including cytarabine, with expiry in 2025. 

&#160;

&#183; 

EPO Patent No 2473507 B1, which has been validated in multiple EPO member states, claims a process for making certain compositions containing vosaroxin, with expiry in 2030. 

&#160;

&#183; 

EPO Patent No. 2049109 B1, which will be validated in multiple EPO member states, claims combinations of vosaroxin and cytarabine in clinically relevant doses to t reat leukemias, with expiry in 2027. 

&#160;

&#183; 

EPO Patent No. 2295056 B1, which will be validated in multiple EPO member states, claims vosaroxin for use in clinically relevant doses for treatment of leukemia, with expiry in 2025. 

In addition to the listed US and European patents, we have been granted similar and related patents in certain other countries, and patent applications are pending in these and other countries, including major markets, throughout the world. Other patents have also been granted in the US and other countries claiming certain technology related to vosaroxin and other methods of use of vosaroxin.

As of December 31, 2015, we own, co-own or have rights to approximately 148 granted U.S. and foreign patents, and approximately 120 pending U.S. and foreign applications, pertaining to vosaroxin and compositions and uses thereof. When appropriate, we intend to seek patent term restoration, orphan drug status and/or data exclusivity in the United States and their equivalents in other relevant jurisdictions, to the maximum extent that the respective laws will permit at such time. In April 2012, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of AML, which may provide for 10 years of marketing exclusivity in all member countries of the European Union following product approval for this indication in Europe. In 2009, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of AML. 

Our ability to build and maintain our proprietary position for vosaroxin and any future drug candidates, if any, will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing granted claims. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which some important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of patent claims has emerged to date in the United States. The patent situation outside the United States is even more uncertain. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Even if patents are issued, they may not be sufficient to protect vosaroxin or future drug candidates, if any. The patents we own or license and those that may be issued in the future may be opposed, challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages. 

Patent applications filed before November 29, 2000 in the United States are maintained in secrecy until patents issue. Later-filed U.S. applications and patent applications in most foreign countries generally are not published until at least 18 months after their earliest filing date. Scientific and patent publication often occurs long after the date of the scientific discoveries disclosed in those publications. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent the subject matter covered by any patent application or that we were the first to file a patent application for any inventions. 

Our commercial success depends on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to conduct our business. The existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. If patents containing competitive or conflicting claims are issued to third parties and these claims are ultimately determined to be valid, we may be enjoined from pursuing research, development or commercialization of vosaroxin or future drug candidates, if any, or be required to obtain licenses to such patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. 

We may need to commence or defend litigation to enforce or to determine the scope and validity of any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights. Litigation would result in substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome in litigation affecting proprietary rights we own or have licensed could present significant risk of competition for vosaroxin or future drug candidates, if any, that we market or seek to develop. Any adverse outcome in litigation affecting third party proprietary rights could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and could require us to seek licenses of the disputed rights from third parties or to cease using the technology if such licenses are unavailable. 

We also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially in situations or jurisdictions in which we believe patent protection may not be appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain and do not protect technology against independent developments made by third parties. 

We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. There can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection, that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have an adequate remedy for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by a third party. 

We seek to protect our company na me and the names of our products and technologies by obtaining trademark registrations, as well as common law rights in trademarks and service marks, in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance that the trademarks or service mark s we use or register will protect our company name or any products or technologies that we develop and commercialize, that our trademarks, service marks, or trademark registrations will be enforceable against third parties, or that our trademarks and servi ce marks will not interfere with or infringe trademark rights of third parties. We may need to commence litigation to enforce our trademarks and service marks or to determine the scope and validity of our or a third party&#8217;s trademark rights. Litigation wou ld result in substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to seek licenses of the disputed rights from third parties or to c ease using the trademarks or service marks if such licenses are unavailable. 

Government Regulation 

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, advertising and promotion of vosaroxin and any future drug candidates we may develop, if any. The application of these regulatory frameworks to the development, approval and commercialization of vosaroxin or our future drug candidates, if any, will take a number of years to accomplish, if at all, and involve the expenditure of substantial resources. 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before vosaroxin and any future drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, in vivo preclinical studies and formulation studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission of an NDA to the FDA; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA, including proposed labeling (package insert information) and promotional materials, prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug. 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for vosaroxin or our future drug candidates, if any, will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Preclinical Testing and INDs 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. Laboratories that comply with the FDA Good Laboratory Practice regulations must conduct preclinical safety tests. The results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND application to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. 

Clinical Trials 

Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational drug to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Protection of Human Subjects regulations and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application. 

In addition, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an inde pendent institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution where the study will be conducted. Each IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA, an IRB or t he sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements and regulations for in formed consent. 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap, sometimes followed by a fourth phase: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety (adverse effects), dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. In some cases, particularly in cancer trials, a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a &#8220;Phase 1b&#8221; evaluation, which is a second safety-focused Phase 1 clinical trial typically designed to evaluate the impact of the drug candidate in combination with currently approved drugs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a &#8220;Phase 2b&#8221; evaluation, which is a second, confirmatory Phase 2 clinical trial that could, if positive and accepted by the FDA, serve as a pivotal clinical trial in the approval of a drug candidate. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal trials. When Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a drug candidate has potential activity in a disease or condition and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 4 (post-marketing) clinical trials may be required by the FDA in some cases. The FDA may conditionally approve an NDA for a drug candidate on a sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug&#8217;s safety and/or efficacy after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 

New Drug Applications 

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, which fees are typically increased annually. 

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most such applications for non-priority products within 10 months of filing, and most applications for priority review products, that is, drugs that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted. 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take many years to complete. Data o btained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. We may encounter difficultie s or unanticipated costs in our efforts to develop our product candidates and secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. 

After the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMs, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

The United States Orphan Drug Act promotes the development of products that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Upon receipt of orphan drug designation from the FDA, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 50% for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, waiver of PDUFA application fee, and upon approval, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication. In October 2009, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for treatment of AML. 

In the European Union, orphan status is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 people, and provides for the potential for 10 years of marketing exclusivity in Europe for the orphan-designated product for the orphan-designated indication. The marketing exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In April 2012, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to vosaroxin for the treatment of AML.

Fast Track Designation 

The FDA&#8217;s fast track program is intended to facilitate the development, and to expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. 

With fast track designation, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the time period specified in the PDUFA, which governs the time period goals the FDA has committed to reviewing an application, does not begin until the complete application is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

In some cases, a fast track designated drug candidate may also qualify for priority review. Under FDA policies, a drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or, under Prescription Drug User Fee Act V, review within eight months from the time a complete NDA is submitted (a six-month review period begins at the conclusion of the 60-day filing review period that begins on the date of FDA receipt of the submission), if the drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. A fast track designated drug candidate would ordinarily meet the FDA&#8217;s criteria for priority review. 

In February 2011, the FDA granted fast track designation to vosaroxin for the potential treatment of relapsed or refractory AML in combination with cytarabine. 

Satisfaction of FDA regulations and approval requirements or similar requirements of for eign regulatory agencies typically takes several years, and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Typically, if a drug candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease, as is the case with vosaroxin, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for new indications for our drug candidates on a timely basis, or at all. Even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease st ates, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug may result in restrictions on the drug or even complete withdrawal of the drug from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain, regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates would harm our business. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action. 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us, Biogen Idec, Takeda, or our potential future licensees or collaboration partners, if any, pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. 

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, including cancer therapy. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off-label use. 

Reimbursement 

Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. These third-party payors have been increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. In particular, government entities have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our ability to achieve significant net sales and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. 

For example, implementation of the Affordable Care Act has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government&#8217;s comparative effectiveness research. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several 

government programs. This includes reducti ons to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the Ame rican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.

Healthcare Law and Regulation

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws restrict our business activities, including certain marketing practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback laws,false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.

The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item, good, facility or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration that are alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 

Federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implem enting regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s security standards directly applicable to business associates, ind ependent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to ma ke civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and cos ts associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 

The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 

Foreign Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of vosaroxin or our future drug candidates, if any. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 

Under European Union regulatory systems, permission to conduct clinical research is granted by the Competent Authority of each European Member State, or MS, and the applicable Ethics Committees, or EC, through the submission of a Clinical Trial Application. An EC in the European Union serves the same function as an IRB in the United States. The review times vary by MS but may not exceed 60 days. The EC has a maximum of 60 days to give its opinion on the acceptability of the Clinical Trial Application to both the governing MS and the sponsor applicant. If the application is deemed acceptable, the MS informs the applicant (or does not within the 60-day window inform the applicant of non-acceptance) and the company may proceed with the clinical trial. 

To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, under the centralized procedure for vosaroxin. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization from the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, of the EMA that is valid in all European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP.

In the EEA, the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. A European Union orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial 

incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is su fficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA&#8217;s Pediatric Committee, or the PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all Member States of the European Union and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months&#8217; supplementary protection certificate extension. For orphan-designated medicinal products, the 10-year period of market exclusivity is extended to 12 years.

In addition to regulations in the United States and, the European Union, we will be subject to a variety of other foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our product candidates. Our ability to sell drugs will also depend on the availability of reimbursement from government and private insurance companies. 

Research and Development Expenses 

We incurred $23.7 million, $27.7 million and $28.9 million of research and development expenses in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily related to the development of vosaroxin. We expect to continue to incur significant development expenses related to the development of vosaroxin.
