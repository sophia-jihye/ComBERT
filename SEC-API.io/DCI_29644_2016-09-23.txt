The Company has two &#32;reporting segments: Engine Products and Industrial Products. Products in the Engine Products segment consist of air filtration systems, exhaust and emissions systems, liquid filtration systems including hydraulics, fuel, and lube systems as well as replacement filters. The Engine Products segment sells to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the construction, mining, agriculture, aerospace, defense and truck markets, and to independent distributors, OEM dealer networks, private label accounts and large equipment fleets. Products in the Industrial Products segment consist of dust, fume and mist collectors, compressed air purification systems, air filtration systems for gas turbines, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane-based products and specialized air and gas filtration systems for applications including computer hard disk drives and semi-conductor manufacturing. The Industrial Products segment sells to various industrial dealers, distributors, OEMs of gas-fired turbines and OEMs and end-users requiring clean filtration solutions and replacement filters. 

The discussion below should be read in conjunction with the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report).

Total net sales contributed by the principal classes of similar products and financial information about segment operations and geographic regions appear in Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

The Company makes its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information (including amendments to those reports) available free of charge through its website at www.donaldson.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files such material with (or furnishes such material to) the Securities and Exchange Commission.

These documents are also available in print, free of charge, to any person who requests them in writing to the attention of Investor Relations, MS 102, Donaldson Company, Inc., 1400 West 94 th &#32;Street, Bloomington, Minnesota 55431. The information contained on the Company&#8217;s website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report and should not be considered to be part of this report. 

Seasonality 

A number of the Company&#8217;s end markets are dependent on the construction, agricultural and power generation industries which are generally stronger in the second half of the Company&#8217;s fiscal year. The first two quarters of the fiscal year also contain the traditional summer and winter holiday periods which are typically characterized by more customer plant closures. 

Competition 

Principal methods of competition in both the Engine and Industrial Products segments are technology, innovation, price, geographic coverage, service and product performance. The Company competes in a number of highly competitive filtration markets in both segments. The Company believes it is a market leader within many of its product lines, specifically within its Off-Road Equipment and On-Road Products lines for OEMs, and is a significant participant in the aftermarket for replacement filters. The Engine Products segment&#8217;s principal competitors include several large global competitors and many regional competitors, especially in the Engine Aftermarket Products business. The Industrial Products segment&#8217;s principal competitors vary from country to country and include several large regional and global competitors and a significant number of smaller competitors who compete in a specific geographical region or in a limited number of product applications. 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials that the Company uses are steel, filter media, and petroleum-based products including plastics, rubber, and adhesives. Purchased raw materials represent approximately 60% to 65% of the Company&#8217;s cost of goods sold. Of that amount, steel, including fabricated parts, represents approximately 20%. Filter media represents approximately 20% and the remainder is primarily made up of petroleum-based products and other raw material components. 

The cost the Company paid for steel during fiscal 2016 &#32;varied by grade, but in aggregate, decreased during the fiscal year. The steel costs decrease was largely related to the decline in market prices but was also affected by continuous improvement efforts. The Company&#8217;s cost of filter media also varies by type and decreased slightly year over year. The cost of petroleum-based products was also down in relation to lower costs for petrochemicals and continuous improvement efforts. The Company anticipates a moderately favorable impact from commodity prices in fiscal 2017 , as compared to fiscal 2016 , specifically for petroleum-based products. On an ongoing basis, the Company enters into selective supply arrangements with certain of its suppliers that allow the Company to reduce volatility in its costs. The Company strives to recover or offset all material cost increases through selective price increases to its customers and the Company&#8217;s cost reduction initiatives, which include material substitution, process improvement, and product redesigns. 

Patents and Trademarks 

The Company owns various patents and trademarks, which it considers in the aggregate to constitute a valuable asset, including patents and trademarks for products sold under the Ultra-Web&#174;, PowerCore&#174; and Donaldson&#174; trademarks. However, the Company does not regard the validity of any one patent or trademark as being of material importance. 

Major Customers 

The Company had no &#32;customers that accounted for over 10% &#32;of net sales in the years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 . The Company had no &#32;customers that accounted for over 10% &#32;of gross accounts receivable at July 31, 2016 &#32;or July 31, 2015 . 

Backlog 

At August 31, 2016 , the backlog of orders expected to be delivered within 90 days was $323.0 million . The 90-day backlog at August 31, 2015 , was $331.0 million . Backlog is one of many indicators of business conditions in the Company&#8217;s markets. However, it is not always indicative of future results for a number of reasons, including short lead times in the Company&#8217;s replacement parts businesses and the timing of orders in many of the Company&#8217;s Engine Products OEM and Industrial Products markets. 

Research and Development 

During the years ended July 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , the Company spent $55.5 million , $60.2 million &#32;and $61.8 million , respectively, on research and development activities. Research and development expenses include basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances to the development of new and improved products and their uses. Substantially all commercial research and development is performed in-house. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company does not anticipate any material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position during fiscal 2017 &#32;due to compliance with government regulations regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. 

Employees 

The Company employed approximately 11,700 people in its worldwide operations as of July 31, 2016 . 

Geographic Areas 

Both of the Company's segments serve customers in all geographic regions worldwide. The United States represents the largest current individual market for the Company's products. Germany is the single largest market outside the United States. Financial information by geographic areas appears in Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this Annual Report.
