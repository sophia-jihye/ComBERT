Business 

Introduction 

American Financial Group, Inc. (&#8220;AFG&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a holding company that, through the operations of Great American Insurance Group, is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses, and in the sale of fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets. Its address is 301 East Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202; its phone number is (513) 579-2121.

Property and Casualty Insurance Segment &#32; 

General 

AFG&#8217;s property and casualty operations provide a wide range of commercial coverages through over 30 niche insurance businesses that make up the Great American Insurance Group. AFG&#8217;s property and casualty insurance operations ultimately report to a single senior executive and operate under a business model that allows local decision-making for underwriting, claims and policy servicing in each of the niche operations. Each business is managed by experienced professionals in particular lines or customer groups and operates autonomously but with certain central controls and accountability. The decentralized approach allows each unit the autonomy necessary to respond to local and specialty market conditions while capitalizing on the efficiencies of centralized investment and administrative support functions. AFG&#8217;s property and casualty insurance operations employed approximately 6,500 people as of December 31, 2015 . These operations are conducted through the subsidiaries listed in the following table, which includes independent financial strength ratings and 2015 &#32;gross written premiums (in millions) for each major subsidiary. These ratings are generally based on concerns for policyholders and agents and are not directed toward the protection of investors. AFG believes that maintaining a rating in the &#8220;A&#8221; category by A.M. Best is important to compete successfully in most lines of business. &#32;

The primary objectives of AFG&#8217;s property and casualty insurance operations are to achieve solid underwriting profitability and provide excellent service to its policyholders and agents. Underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio, which is a sum of the ratios of losses, loss adjustment expenses (&#8220;LAE&#8221;), underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends to premiums. A combined ratio under 100% indicates an underwriting profit. The combined ratio does not reflect investment income, other income or federal income taxes. 

While many costs included in underwriting are readily determined (commissions, administrative expenses and many of the losses on claims reported), the process of determining overall underwriting results is highly dependent upon the use of estimates in the case of losses incurred or expected but not yet reported or developed. Actuarial procedures and projections are 

used to obtain &#8220;point estimates&#8221; of ultimate losses. While the process is imprecise and develops amounts which are subject to change over time, management believes that the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate. 

AFG&#8217;s statutory combined ratio averaged 93.4% for the period 2013 &#32;to 2015 &#32;as compared to 97.3% for the property and casualty industry over the same period (Source: &#8220;A.M. Best&#8217;s U.S. Property/Casualty Review &#38; Preview&#8221; &#8212; February 2016 Edition). AFG believes that its specialty niche focus, product line diversification and underwriting discipline have contributed to the Company&#8217;s ability to consistently outperform the industry&#8217;s underwriting results. Management&#8217;s philosophy is to refrain from writing business that is not expected to produce an underwriting profit even if it is necessary to limit premium growth to do so. 

Financial data is reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) for shareholder and other investment purposes and reported on a statutory basis for insurance regulatory purposes. Major differences for statutory accounting include charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred rather than spreading the costs over the periods covered by the policies; reporting investment grade bonds and redeemable preferred stocks at amortized cost rather than fair value; netting of reinsurance recoverables and prepaid reinsurance premiums against the corresponding liabilities rather than reporting such items separately; and charging to surplus certain GAAP assets, such as furniture and fixtures and agents&#8217; balances over 90 days old. 

Unless indicated otherwise, the financial information presented for the property and casualty insurance operations herein is presented based on GAAP. Statutory information is provided for industry comparisons or where comparable GAAP information is not readily available. 

Property and Casualty Results 

Performance measures such as underwriting profit or loss and related combined ratios are often used by property and casualty insurers to help users of their financial statements better understand the company&#8217;s performance. See Note C &#160;&#8212; &#8220; Segments of Operations &#8221; &#32;to the financial statements for the reconciliation of AFG&#8217;s earnings before income taxes by significant business segment to the Statement of Earnings.

The source of the industry ratios is &#8220;A.M. Best&#8217;s U.S. Property/Casualty &#8212; Review &#38; Preview&#8221; (February 2016 Edition). 

As with other property and casualty insurers, AFG&#8217;s operating results can be adversely affected by unpredictable catastrophe losses. Certain natural disasters (hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, etc.) and other incidents of major loss (explosions, civil disorder, terrorist events, fires, etc.) are classified as catastrophes by industry associations. Losses from these incidents are usually tracked separately from other business of insurers because of their sizable effects on overall operations. Total net losses to AFG&#8217;s insurance operations from current accident year catastrophes were $35 million in 2015 , $28 million in 2014 &#32;and $31 million in 2013 &#32;and are included in the table above. 

AFG generally seeks to reduce its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection, including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures, and the purchase of reinsurance. AFG&#8217;s net exposure to a catastrophic earthquake or windstorm that industry models indicate could occur once in every 500 years (a &#8220;500-year event&#8221;) is expected to be less than 3.5% of AFG&#8217;s shareholders&#8217; equity. 

Property and Casualty Insurance Products 

AFG is focused on growth opportunities in what it believes to be more profitable specialty businesses where AFG personnel are experts in particular lines of business or customer groups. The following are examples of AFG&#8217;s specialty businesses: 

Property and Transportation 

&#160; 

Inland and Ocean Marine 

Provides coverage primarily for builders&#8217; risk, contractors&#8217; equipment, property, motor truck cargo, marine cargo, boat dealers, marina operators/dealers and excursion vessels. 

Agricultural-related 

Provides federally reinsured multi-peril crop (allied lines) insurance covering most perils as well as crop-hail, equine mortality and other coverages for full-time operating farms/ranches and agribusiness operations on a nationwide basis. 

Commercial Automobile 

Provides coverage for vehicles (such as buses and trucks) in a broad range of businesses including the moving and storage and transportation industries, and a specialized physical damage product for the trucking industry. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Specialty Casualty 

&#160; 

Executive and Professional Liability 

Markets coverage for directors and officers of businesses and non-profit organizations; errors and omissions; mergers and acquisitions; and provides medical malpractice insurance. 

Umbrella and Excess Liability 

Provides liability coverage in excess of primary layers. 

Excess and Surplus 

Provides liability, umbrella and excess coverage for unique, volatile or hard to place risks, using rates and forms that generally do not have to be approved by state insurance regulators. 

General Liability 

Provides coverage for contractor-related businesses, energy development and production risks, and environmental liability risks. 

Targeted Programs 

Includes coverage (primarily liability and property) for social service agencies, leisure, entertainment and non-profit organizations, customized solutions for other targeted markets and alternative risk programs using agency captives. 

Workers&#8217; Compensation 

Provides coverage for prescribed benefits payable to employees who are injured on the job. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Specialty Financial 

&#160; 

Fidelity and Surety 

Provides fidelity and crime coverage for government, mercantile and financial institutions and surety coverage for various types of contractors and public and private corporations. 

Lease and Loan Services 

Provides coverage for insurance risk management programs for lending and leasing institutions, including equipment leasing and collateral and lender-placed mortgage property insurance. 

Management believes specialization is the key element to the underwriting success of these business units. These specialty businesses are opportunistic and their premium volume will vary based on prevailing market conditions. AFG continually evaluates expansion in existing markets and opportunities in new specialty markets that meet its profitability objectives. For example, in April 2014, AFG acquired Summit Holding Southeast, Inc. and its related companies. Summit, which is a leading 

provider of workers&#8217; compensation solutions in the southeastern United States, generated $529 million in net written premiums in 2015. Likewise, AFG will withdraw from markets that do not meet its profit objectives or business strategy, such as the withdrawal from certain auto programs over the last few years. 

In October of 2015, AFG announced the hiring of a new management team at Marketform with extensive underwriting experience in the Lloyd&#8217;s market. The new management is in the process of evaluating Marketform&#8217;s operational structure and lines of business with the goal of improving the profitability of these operations.

Reinsurance 

&#160; 

Consistent with standard practice of most insurance companies, AFG reinsures a portion of its property and casualty business with other insurance companies and assumes a relatively small amount of business from other insurers. AFG uses reinsurance for two primary purposes: (i) to provide higher limits of coverage than it would otherwise be willing to provide (i.e. large line capacity) and (ii) to protect its business by reducing the impact of catastrophes. The availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, which may affect the volume and profitability of business that is written. AFG is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers, as the ceding of risk to reinsurers does not relieve AFG of its liability to its insureds until claims are fully settled. 

The commercial marketplace requires large policy limits ($25 million or more) in several of AFG&#8217;s lines of business, including certain executive and professional liability, umbrella and excess liability, and fidelity and surety coverages. Since these limits exceed management&#8217;s desired exposure to an individual risk, AFG generally enters into reinsurance agreements to reduce its net exposure under such policies to an acceptable level. Reinsurance continues to be available for this large line capacity exposure with satisfactory pricing and terms. 

AFG has taken steps to limit its exposure to wind and earthquake losses by purchasing catastrophe reinsurance. In addition, AFG purchases catastrophe reinsurance for its workers&#8217; compensation businesses. Although the cost of catastrophe reinsurance varies depending on exposure and the level of worldwide loss activity, AFG continues to obtain reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts at acceptable rates due to management&#8217;s decision to limit overall exposure to catastrophe losses through individual risk selection (including minimizing coastal and known fault-line exposures). 

In addition to traditional reinsurance, AFG has catastrophe coverage through a catastrophe bond structure with Riverfront Re Ltd. that provides coverage up to $95 million (fully collateralized) for catastrophe losses in excess of $119 million per occurrence for the period from April 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016. 

In addition to the large line capacity and catastrophe reinsurance programs discussed above, AFG purchases reinsurance on a product-by-product basis. AFG regularly reviews the financial strength of its current and potential reinsurers. These reviews include consideration of credit ratings, available capital, claims paying history and expertise. This process periodically results in the transfer of risks to more financially secure reinsurers. Substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S&#38;P ratings or is secured by &#8220;funds withheld&#8221; or other collateral. Under &#8220;funds withheld&#8221; arrangements, AFG retains ceded premiums to fund ceded losses as they become due from the reinsurer. Recoverables from the following companies were individually between 5% and 11% of AFG&#8217;s total property and casualty reinsurance recoverable (including prepaid reinsurance premiums and net of payables to reinsurers) at December 31, 2015 : Hannover Reinsurance Co. Ltd, Munich Reinsurance America, Inc. and Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation. In addition, AFG has a reinsurance recoverable from Ohio Casualty Insurance Company of $159 million related to that company&#8217;s purchase of AFG&#8217;s commercial lines business in 1998. No other reinsurers exceeded 5% of AFG&#8217;s property and casualty reinsurance recoverable. 

Reinsurance is provided on one of two bases, facultative or treaty. Facultative reinsurance is generally provided on a risk by risk basis. Individual risks are ceded and assumed based on an offer and acceptance of risk by each party to the transaction. AFG purchases facultative reinsurance, both pro rata and excess of loss, depending on the risk and available reinsurance markets. Treaty reinsurance provides for risks meeting prescribed criteria to be automatically ceded and assumed according to contract provisions. 

The following table presents (by type of coverage) the amount of each loss above the specified retention maximum generally covered by treaty reinsurance programs (in millions) as of January 1, 2016:

Reinsurance covers substantial portions of losses in excess of retention. However, in general, losses resulting from terrorism are not covered. 

(b) 

Includes coverage for $95 million of losses excess of $119 million (per occurrence) provided through the Riverfront Re Ltd. catastrophe bond. 

In addition to the coverage shown above, AFG reinsures a portion of its crop insurance business through the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FCIC&#8221;). The FCIC offers both proportional (or &#8220;quota share&#8221;) and non-proportional coverages. The proportional coverage provides that a fixed percentage of risk is assumed by the FCIC. The non-proportional coverage allows AFG to select desired retention of risk on a state-by-state, county, crop or plan basis. AFG typically reinsures 15% to 25% of gross written premiums with the FCIC. AFG also purchases quota share reinsurance in the private market. This quota share provides for a ceding commission to AFG and a profit sharing provision. During both 2015 &#32;and 2014 , AFG reinsured 52.5% of premiums not reinsured by the FCIC in the private market and purchased stop loss protection coverage for the remaining portion of the business. AFG expects to utilize similar levels of reinsurance in 2016 . 

The balance sheet caption &#8220;recoverables from reinsurers&#8221; included approximately $80 million on paid losses and LAE and $2.20 billion &#32;on unpaid losses and LAE at December 31, 2015 . These amounts are net of allowances of approximately $22 million for doubtful collection of reinsurance recoverables. The collectibility of a reinsurance balance is based upon the financial condition of a reinsurer as well as individual claim considerations. 

Reinsurance premiums ceded and assumed are presented in the following table (in millions):

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves &#32; 

The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE of AFG&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries. This liability represents estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and LAE and is determined by using case-basis evaluations, actuarial projections and management&#8217;s judgment. These estimates are subject to the effects of changes in claim amounts and frequency and are periodically reviewed and adjusted as additional information becomes known. In accordance with industry practices, such adjustments are reflected in current year operations. Generally, reserves for reinsurance assumed and involuntary pools and associations are reflected in AFG&#8217;s results at the amounts reported by those entities. 

The following table presents the development of AFG&#8217;s liability for losses and LAE, net of reinsurance, on a GAAP basis for the last ten years. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability (in millions) for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for the indicated years. The second line shows the re-estimated liability as of December 31, 2015 . The remainder of the table presents intervening development as percentages of the initially estimated liability. The development results from additional information and experience in subsequent years, as detailed below. The middle line shows a cumulative deficiency (redundancy), which represents the aggregate percentage increase (decrease) in the liability initially estimated. The lower portion of the table indicates the cumulative amounts paid as of successive periods as a percentage of the original loss reserve liability. For purposes of this table, reserves of businesses sold are considered paid at the date of sale. See Note O &#160;&#8212; &#8220; Insurance &#32;&#8212; Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves &#8221; &#32;to the financial statements for an analysis of changes in AFG&#8217;s estimated liability for losses and LAE, net and gross of reinsurance, over the past three years on a GAAP basis.

N/A 

In evaluating the re-estimated liability and cumulative deficiency (redundancy), it should be noted that each percentage includes the effects of changes in amounts for prior periods. For example, AFG&#8217;s $67 million &#32;special A&#38;E charge related to losses recorded in 2015 , but incurred before 2005 , is included in the re-estimated liability and cumulative deficiency (redundancy) percentage for each of the previous years shown. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily exist in the future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table. 

A significant portion of the adverse development in the tables is due to A&#38;E exposures for which AFG has been held liable under general liability policies written prior to 1987, even though such coverage was not intended. Other factors affecting adverse development included changes in the legal environment, including more liberal coverage decisions and higher jury awards, higher legal fees, the general state of the economy and medical cost inflation. 

The differences between the liability for losses and LAE reported in the annual statements filed with the state insurance departments in accordance with statutory accounting principles (&#8220;SAP&#8221;) and that reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP at December 31, 2015 &#32;are as follows (in millions):

Asbestos and Environmental (&#8220;A&#38;E&#8221;) Reserves AFG&#8217;s property and casualty group, like many others in the industry, has A&#38;E claims arising in most cases from general liability policies written more than twenty-five years ago. The establishment of reserves for such A&#38;E claims presents unique and difficult challenges and is subject to uncertainties significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims. For a discussion of these uncertainties, see Item 7 &#160; &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#160; &#8212; &#8220; Uncertainties &#160;&#8212; Asbestos and Environmental-related (&#8220;A&#38;E&#8221;) Insurance Reserves &#8221; and Note M &#160; &#8212; &#8220; Contingencies &#8221; &#32;to the financial statements. 

Management has periodically conducted comprehensive external studies of its asbestos and environmental reserves with the aid of specialty actuarial, engineering and consulting firms and outside counsel, generally every two years, with an in-depth internal review during the intervening years. Charges resulting from these studies and reviews are included in &#8220;Incurred losses and LAE&#8221; in the table below. As a result of the 2015 &#32;external study, AFG recorded a $67 million &#32;pretax special charge in the third quarter of 2015 &#32;to increase the property and casualty group&#8217;s asbestos reserves by $25 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $42 million (net of reinsurance). As the overall industry exposure to asbestos has matured, the focus of litigation has shifted to smaller companies and companies with ancillary exposures. AFG&#8217;s insureds with these exposures have been the driver of the property and casualty segment&#8217;s asbestos reserve increases in recent years; AFG has seen increased estimates for indemnity and defense compared to prior studies. The increase in property and casualty environmental reserves was attributed primarily to AFG&#8217;s increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation 

have increased. There were no newly identified or emerging broad industry trends that were identified in this study. As a result of the in-depth internal review in 2014 , AFG recorded a $24 million &#32;pretax special charge in the third quarter of 2014 &#32;to increase the property and casualty group&#8217;s asbestos reserves by $4 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $20 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in environmental reserves was attributed primarily to AFG&#8217;s increased defense costs and a number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased. As a result of the 2013 &#32;external study, AFG recorded a $54 million &#32;pretax special charge in the third quarter of 2013 &#32;to increase the property and casualty group&#8217;s asbestos reserves by $16 million (net of reinsurance) and its environmental reserves by $38 million (net of reinsurance). The increase in asbestos reserves was driven primarily by slightly higher than expected loss experience, higher defense costs and some increased claim severity. The increase in environmental reserves was attributed primarily to a small number of claims where the estimated costs of remediation have increased. In addition to the third quarter special charge, AFG increased A&#38;E reserves for one claim by $5 million in early 2013 due to fact specific developments. 

The following table (in millions) is a progression of the property and casualty group&#8217;s A&#38;E reserves.

Marketing 

The property and casualty insurance group directs its sales efforts primarily through independent insurance agents and brokers, although small portions are written through employee agents. Independent agents and brokers generally receive a commission on the sale of each policy. Some agents and brokers are eligible for a bonus commission based on the overall profitability of policies placed with AFG by the broker or agent in a particular year. The property and casualty insurance group writes insurance through several thousand agents and brokers. 

Competition 

AFG&#8217;s property and casualty insurance businesses compete with other individual insurers, state funds and insurance groups of varying sizes, some of which are mutual insurance companies possessing competitive advantages in that all their profits inure to their policyholders. See Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors . &#32;They also compete with self-insurance plans, captive programs and risk retention groups. Due to the specialty nature of these coverages, competition is based primarily on service to policyholders and agents, specific characteristics of products offered and reputation for claims handling. Financial strength ratings, price, commissions and profit sharing terms are also important factors. Management believes that sophisticated data analysis for refinement of risk profiles, extensive specialized knowledge and loss prevention service have helped AFG compete successfully. 

Annuity Segment 

General &#32; 

AFG sells traditional fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets through independent producers and through direct relationships with certain financial institutions. The annuity operations employed approximately 500 people at December 31, 2015 . These operations are conducted primarily through the subsidiaries listed in the following table, which includes 2015 &#32;statutory annuity premiums (in millions), annuity policies in force and independent ratings.

AFG believes that the ratings assigned by independent insurance rating agencies are an important competitive factor because agents, potential policyholders, financial institutions, and school districts often use a company&#8217;s rating as an initial screening device in considering annuity products. AFG believes that a rating in the &#8220;A&#8221; category by A.M. Best is necessary to successfully market tax-deferred annuities to public education employees and other non-profit groups and a rating in the &#8220;A&#8221; category by at least one rating agency is necessary to successfully compete in its other annuity markets. AFG believes that these entities can successfully compete in these markets with their respective ratings.

Annuities are long-term retirement saving instruments that benefit from income accruing on a tax-deferred basis. The issuer of the annuity collects premiums, credits interest or earnings on the policy and pays out a benefit upon death, surrender or annuitization. Single premium annuities are generally issued in exchange for a one-time lump-sum premium payment. Certain annuities, primarily in the education market, have premium payments that are flexible in both amount and timing as determined by the policyholder and are generally made through payroll deductions. 

Annuity contracts are generally classified as either fixed rate (including fixed-indexed) or variable. With a traditional fixed rate annuity, AFG seeks to maintain a desired spread between the yield on its investment portfolio and the rate it credits to policyholders. AFG accomplishes this by: (i) offering crediting rates that it has the option to change after any initial guarantee period (subject to minimum interest rate and other contractual guarantees); (ii) designing annuity products that encourage persistency; and (iii) maintaining an appropriate matching of assets and liabilities. 

A fixed-indexed annuity provides policyholders with the opportunity to receive a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing market index (generally the S&#38;P 500) while protecting against the related downside risk through a guarantee of principal (excluding surrender charges, market value adjustments, and certain benefit charges). AFG purchases call options designed to substantially offset the effect of the index participation in the liabilities associated with fixed-indexed annuities. 

As an ancillary product in its education market, AFG offers a limited amount of variable annuities. With a variable annuity, the earnings credited to the policy vary based on the investment results of the underlying investment options chosen by the policyholder, generally without any guarantee of principal except in the case of death of the insured. Premiums directed to the underlying investment options maintained in separate accounts are invested in funds managed by various independent investment managers. AFG earns a fee on amounts deposited into separate accounts. Subject to contractual provisions, 

policyholders may also choose to direct all or a portion of their premiums to various fixed-rate options, in which case AFG earns a spread on amounts deposited. 

The profitability of a fixed annuity business is largely dependent on the ability of a company to earn income on the assets supporting the business in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts plus expenses incurred (earning a &#8220;spread&#8221;). Performance measures such as net spread earned are often presented by annuity businesses to help users of their financial statements better understand the company&#8217;s performance. The table shows the earnings before income taxes, as well as the net spread earned on fixed annuities, for the annuity segment both before and after the impact of fair value accounting for derivatives related to fixed-indexed annuities (&#8220;FIAs&#8221;) (dollars in millions):

Fixed-indexed annuities, which represented approximately 60% &#32;of annuity benefits accumulated at December 31, 2015 , provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied, in part, to the performance of an existing stock market index. AFG attempts to mitigate the risk in the index-based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index. AFG&#8217;s strategy is designed so that the change in the fair value of the call option assets will generally offset the economic change in the liabilities from the index participation. Both the index-based component of the annuities (fair value of $1.37 billion at December 31, 2015 ) and the related call options (fair value of $241 million at December 31, 2015 ) are considered derivatives that must be marked-to-market through earnings each period. Fluctuations in interest rates and the stock market, among other factors, can cause volatility in the periodic measurement of fair value of the embedded derivative that management believes can be inconsistent with the long-term economics of these products. 

Marketing 

AFG sells its single premium annuities, excluding financial institution production (discussed below), primarily through a retail network of approximately 60 national marketing organizations (&#8220;NMOs&#8221;) and managing general agents (&#8220;MGAs&#8221;) who, in turn, direct nearly 1,400 actively producing agents. 

AFG also sells single premium annuities in financial institutions through direct relationships with certain financial institutions and through independent agents and brokers. The table below shows the financial institutions that accounted for AFG&#8217;s largest sources of annuity premiums in 2015 :

In the education market, schools may allow employees to save for retirement through contributions made on a before-tax basis. Federal income taxes are not payable on pretax contributions or earnings until amounts are withdrawn. AFG sells its education market annuities directly through writing agents rather than through NMOs and MGAs. 

AFG is licensed to sell its fixed annuity products in all states except New York; it is licensed to sell its variable products in all states except New York and Vermont. At December 31, 2015 , AFG had approximately 490,000 annuity policies in force.

Competition 

AFG&#8217;s annuity businesses operate in highly competitive markets. They compete with other insurers and financial institutions based on many factors, including: (i) ratings; (ii) financial strength; (iii) reputation; (iv) service to policyholders and agents; (v) product design (including interest rates credited, bonus features and index participation); (vi) commissions; and (vii) number of school districts in which a company has approval to sell. Since most policies are marketed and distributed through independent agents, the insurance companies must also compete for agents. 

No single insurer dominates the markets in which AFG&#8217;s annuity businesses compete. See Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors . &#32;Competitors include (i) individual insurers and insurance groups, (ii) mutual funds and (iii) other financial institutions. In a broader sense, AFG&#8217;s annuity businesses compete for retirement savings with a variety of financial institutions offering a full range of financial services. In the financial institution annuity market, AFG&#8217;s annuities compete directly against competitors&#8217; annuities, certificates of deposit and other investment alternatives at the point of sale. In addition, over the last few years, several offshore and/or hedge fund companies have made significant acquisitions of annuity businesses, resulting in annuity groups that are larger in size than AFG&#8217;s annuity business. 

Sales of annuities, including renewal premiums, are affected by many factors, including: (i) competitive annuity products and rates; (ii) the general level and volatility of interest rates, including the slope of the yield curve; (iii) the favorable tax treatment of annuities; (iv) commissions paid to agents; (v) services offered; (vi) ratings from independent insurance rating agencies; (vii) other alternative investments; (viii) performance and volatility of the equity markets; (ix) media coverage of annuities; (x) regulatory developments regarding suitability and the sales process; and (xi) general economic conditions. 

Run-off Long-term Care and Life Segment 

AFG ceased new sales of long-term care insurance in January 2010 and sold substantially all of its run-off long-term care business in December 2015. See Note B &#32;&#8212; &#8220; Acquisitions and Sale of Businesses &#8221; to the financial statements. Renewal premiums on the remaining policies covering approximately 1,700 lives will be accepted unless those policies lapse. At December 31, 2015 , AFG&#8217;s long-term care insurance reserves were $34 million, net of reinsurance recoverables and excluding the impact of unrealized gains on securities. 

Although AFG no longer actively markets new life insurance products, it continues to service and receive renewal premiums on its in-force block of approximately 126,000 policies and $14.67 billion gross ($3.48 billion net of reinsurance) of life insurance in force at December 31, 2015 . Renewal premiums, net of reinsurance, were $28 million in 2015 , $30 million in 2014 &#32;and $33 million in 2013 . At December 31, 2015 , AFG&#8217;s life insurance reserves were $320 million, net of reinsurance recoverables. 

Other Operations &#32; 

Through subsidiaries, AFG is engaged in a variety of other operations, including commercial real estate operations in Cincinnati (office buildings and The Cincinnatian Hotel), Whitefield, New Hampshire (Mountain View Grand Resort), Chesapeake Bay (Skipjack Cove Yachting Resort and Bay Bridge Marina), Charleston (Charleston Harbor Resort and Marina), Palm Beach (Sailfish Marina and Resort), greater Chicago (KeyLime Cove Indoor Waterpark Resort) and apartments in Pittsburgh. These operations employed approximately 400 full-time employees at December 31, 2015 .

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) has retained third-party investment management firms to assist in the determination of appropriate NAIC designations for mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;) based not only on the probability of loss (which is the primary basis of ratings by the major ratings firms), but also on the severity of loss and statutory carrying value. Approximately 18% of AFG&#8217;s fixed maturity investments are MBS. At December 31, 2015 , 97% (based on statutory carrying value of $31.58 billion) of AFG&#8217;s fixed maturity investments held by its insurance companies had an NAIC designation of 1 or 2 (the highest of the six designations). 

Equity Investments 

At December 31, 2015 , AFG held common and perpetual preferred stocks classified as available for sale with a fair value of $1.55 billion . 

Regulation &#32; 

AFG&#8217;s insurance company subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions where they do business. In general, the insurance laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers governing, among other things, premium rates, solvency standards, licensing of insurers, agents and brokers, trade practices, forms of policies, maintenance of specified reserves and capital for the protection of policyholders, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, investment activities and relationships between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates. Material transactions between insurance subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates generally must receive prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authorities and be disclosed. In addition, while differing from state to state, these regulations typically restrict the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by an insurer to its shareholders in any twelve-month period without advance regulatory approval. Such limitations are generally based on net earnings or statutory surplus. Under applicable restrictions, the maximum amount of dividends available to AFG in 2016 &#32;from its insurance subsidiaries without seeking regulatory clearance is approximately $809 million . 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), among other things, established a Federal Insurance Office (&#8220;FIO&#8221;) within the U.S. Treasury. Under this law, regulations will need to be created for the FIO to carry out its mandate to focus on systemic risk oversight. The FIO has gathered information regarding the insurance industry and submitted a report to Congress in December 2013. The report concluded that a hybrid approach to regulation, involving a combination of state and federal government action, could improve the U.S. insurance system by attaining uniformity, efficiency and consistency, particularly with respect to solvency and market conduct regulation. We cannot predict the extent to which the report&#8217;s recommendations might result in changes to the current state-based system of insurance industry regulation or ultimately impact AFG&#8217;s operations. 

Marketform, AFG&#8217;s UK-based Lloyd&#8217;s insurer, is subject to regulation by the European Union&#8217;s executive body, the European Commission. In 2016, Marketform will be required to adopt new capital adequacy and risk management regulations known as Solvency II. Because Lloyd&#8217;s insurers are already operating under the proposed Solvency II guidelines, implementation is not expected to be material to AFG. 

Most states have created insurance guaranty associations that assess solvent insurers to pay claims of insurance companies that become insolvent. Annual guaranty assessments for AFG&#8217;s insurance companies have not been material.
