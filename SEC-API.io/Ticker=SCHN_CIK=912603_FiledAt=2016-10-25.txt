 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Founded in 1906, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. ("SSI"), an Oregon corporation, is one of North America&#8217;s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products. Worldwide demand for scrap metal is driven primarily by steel production levels. Steel mill production using electric arc furnace (&#8220;EAF&#8221;) technology relies on scrap metal as its primary feedstock, and steel manufacturing using blast furnace technology also uses scrap metal for a portion of its raw materials. Steel mills around the world, including those in the North American domestic market in which our own steel mill operates, are the primary end markets for our recycled scrap metal. 

Our internal organizational and reporting structure supports two operating and reportable segments: the Auto and Metals Recycling ("AMR") business and the Steel Manufacturing Business ("SMB"). 

AMR collects and recycles autobodies, rail cars, home appliances, industrial machinery, manufacturing scrap and construction and demolition scrap from bridges, buildings and other infrastructure. We source material through well-developed, regional supply chains that collect scrap from large and small businesses and individuals. Our largest source of autobodies is our own network of 52 &#32;self-service auto parts stores, which operate under the commercial brand-name Pick-n-Pull, a majority of which are located in close geographic proximity to our metals recycling operating facilities, six of which have large-scale shredders. 

AMR processes recycled metals ranging from iron and steel to aluminum, copper, lead, stainless steel and zinc for use in the manufacture of new products. With operating facilities located in 23 &#32;States, Puerto Rico and Western Canada, we are well-positioned to efficiently collect scrap metal throughout North America and deliver products to customers around the world from our seven &#32;deep water ports. In fiscal 2016 , we sold our products to customers located in 24 &#32;countries including the United States ("U.S.") and Canada, and we shipped 3.3 million &#32;tons of ferrous scrap metal and 510 million &#32;pounds of nonferrous scrap metal. AMR generated 89% &#32;of its revenues in fiscal 2016 from sales of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal, with the remainder generated from retail and other sales. AMR's revenues by scrap product were 68% &#32;ferrous and 32% &#32;nonferrous in fiscal 2016. 

SMB produces finished steel products such as rebar, wire rod, coiled rebar, merchant bar and other specialty products using nearly 100% recycled metal sourced from AMR. SMB's products are primarily used in nonresidential and infrastructure construction in North America. In fiscal 2016 , SMB sold 488 thousand &#32;short tons of finished steel. 

In recent years we have undertaken a number of productivity improvements and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability and to achieve further integration and synergistic cost efficiencies in our operating platform. Measures initiated since the beginning of fiscal 2015 target a combined benefit to annual operating performance of $95 million. We achieved $78 million of benefits in fiscal 2016 related to these fiscal 2015 and 2016 measures, compared to $28 million of benefits in fiscal 2015. We expect to achieve substantially all of the $95 million of benefits in fiscal 2017. 

We incurred restructuring charges and other exit-related activities during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 in connection with productivity improvement and restructuring initiatives. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of this report for further discussion of restructuring initiatives, benefits and costs. 

Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, our internal organizational and reporting structure supported three operating and reportable segments: the Metals Recycling Business ("MRB"), the Auto Parts Business ("APB") and the Steel Manufacturing Business ("SMB"). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we combined and integrated our auto parts and metals recycling businesses into a single operating platform. This change in organizational structure further optimized the efficiencies in our operating platform, enabling additional synergies to be captured throughout our supply chain and global sales channels and more effectively leveraging our shared services platform. The change in our internal organizational and reporting structure resulted in the formation of a new operating and reportable segment, AMR, replacing the former MRB and APB segments. We began reporting on this new segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as reflected in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2015. The segment data for the comparable periods presented prior to the segment change has been recast to conform to the current presentation for all activities of AMR. Recasting this historical information did not have an impact on the consolidated financial performance of SSI for any of the periods presented. 

See Note 18 &#32;&#8211; Segment Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the primary activities of each reportable segment, total assets by reportable segment, operating results from continuing operations, revenues from external customers and concentration of sales to foreign countries.

Auto and Metals Recycling 

Business 

AMR sells and brokers ferrous scrap metal (containing iron) to foreign and domestic steel producers, including SMB, and nonferrous scrap metal (not containing iron) to both foreign and domestic markets. AMR buys, collects, processes and recycles autobodies, rail cars, home appliances, industrial machinery, manufacturing scrap and construction and demolition scrap through its 97 &#32;auto and metals recycling facilities. Our largest source of autobodies is our own network of auto parts stores, which operate under the commercial brand-name Pick-n-Pull. AMR procures salvaged vehicles and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through its 52 &#32;self-service auto parts stores located across the U.S. and Western Canada. Upon acquiring a salvaged vehicle, we remove catalytic converters, aluminum wheels and batteries for separate processing and sale prior to placing the vehicle in our retail lot. After retail customers have removed desired parts from a vehicle, we remove remaining major component parts containing ferrous and nonferrous materials such as engines, transmissions and alternators, which are primarily sold to wholesalers. The remaining autobodies are crushed and shipped to our metals recycling facilities to be shredded, or sold to third parties where geographically more economical. 

To prepare scrap metal, we crush, sort and bale the material by product grade for easier handling and sale. AMR processes mixed and large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by crushing, torching, shearing, shredding and sorting, resulting in scrap metal pieces of a size, density and metal content required by customers to meet their production needs. The manufacturing process includes physical separation of ferrous and nonferrous materials through automated and manual processes into various sub-classifications, each of which has a value and metal content of importance to different customers for their end products. One of the most efficient ways to process and sort recycled scrap metal is through the use of shredding and separation systems. 

AMR operates seven deep water port locations, six of which are equipped with large-scale shredders. Our largest port facilities in Everett, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Oakland, California; and Tacoma, Washington each operate a mega-shredder with 7,000 to 9,000 horsepower. Our port facilities in Salinas, Puerto Rico and Kapolei, Hawaii each operate a shredder with 1,500 to 6,000 horsepower. Our port facility in Providence, Rhode Island does not operate a shredder. In fiscal 2016, we idled a shredder in Concord, New Hampshire, and in fiscal 2015, we idled a shredder in Johnston, Rhode Island and another in Surrey, British Columbia to more closely align our business to the prevalent market conditions. Our shredders are designed to provide a denser product and, in conjunction with advanced separation equipment, a more refined form of ferrous scrap metal which is used efficiently by steel mills in the production of new steel. The shredding process reduces autobodies and other scrap metal into fist-size pieces of shredded recycled scrap metal. The shredded material is then carried by conveyor under magnetized drums that attract the ferrous scrap metal and separate it from the nonferrous scrap metal and other residue found in the shredded material, resulting in a consistent and high-quality shredded ferrous product. The nonferrous scrap metal and residue then pass through a series of additional mechanical sorting systems designed to separate the nonferrous metal from the residue. The remaining nonferrous metal is then further sorted by product and size grade before being sold. AMR invests in nonferrous metal extraction and separation technologies in order to maximize the recoverability of valuable nonferrous metal. AMR also purchases nonferrous metal directly from industrial vendors and other suppliers and prepares this metal for shipment to customers by ship, rail or truck. 

Products 

AMR's primary products consist of recycled ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal. Ferrous scrap metal is a key feedstock used in the production of finished steel and is largely categorized into heavy melting steel (&#8220;HMS&#8221;), plate and structural (&#8220;bonus&#8221;) and shredded scrap (&#8220;shred&#8221;), although there are various grades of each category depending on metal content and the size and consistency of individual pieces. These attributes affect the product&#8217;s relative value. Our nonferrous products include aluminum, copper, stainless steel, nickel, brass, titanium, lead, high temperature alloys and joint products such as zorba (primarily mixed aluminum nonferrous material) and zurik (predominantly stainless steel). 

Prior to the shredding process, AMR sells serviceable used auto parts from salvaged vehicles through its 52 &#32;self-service auto parts stores located across the U.S. and Western Canada. Each self-service store offers an extensive selection of vehicles (including domestic and foreign cars, vans and light trucks) from which customers can remove parts. We employ proprietary information technology systems to centrally manage and operate the geographically diverse network of auto parts stores, and we regularly rotate the inventory to provide greater access to parts. In general, we believe the list prices of auto parts at our self-service stores are significantly lower than those offered at full-service auto dismantlers, retail car parts stores and car dealerships.

Customers 

AMR sells its ferrous and nonferrous recycled metal products globally to steel mills, foundries and smelters, and supplies the ferrous scrap raw material required by SMB to produce steel. AMR's self-service auto parts stores also serve retail customers who are typically individuals seeking to obtain serviceable used auto parts at a competitive price. Retail customers remove the parts without the assistance of store employees and pay a listed price for the part.

Includes sales to customers in Turkey. 

In fiscal 2016 , the five countries from which AMR derived its largest revenues from external customers were the U.S., Turkey, China, India and South Korea, which collectively accounted for 85% &#32;of total AMR external revenue. In fiscal 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the five countries from which AMR derived its largest revenues from external customers accounted for 82% &#32;and 81% , respectively, of total AMR external revenue. We attribute revenues from external customers to individual countries based on the country in which the customer takes delivery of the goods. 

AMR&#8217;s five largest external ferrous scrap metal customers accounted for 32% &#32;of external recycled ferrous metal revenues in fiscal 2016 , compared to 34% &#32;and 30% &#32;in fiscal 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. AMR had no external customers that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 . Customer purchase volumes of ferrous scrap metal vary from year to year due to the level of demand, availability of supply, economic growth, infrastructure spending, relative currency values, availability of credit and other factors. Ferrous scrap metal sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and nearly all of the large shipments of ferrous scrap metal to foreign customers are supported by letters of credit. 

The table below sets forth, on a revenue and volume basis, the amount of recycled ferrous scrap metal sold by AMR to foreign and domestic customers, including sales to SMB, during the last three fiscal years ended August 31:

AMR's retail auto parts sales account for less than 10% of our consolidated revenues in all of the periods presented. 

Pricing 

Domestic and foreign prices for ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal are generally based on prevailing market rates, which differ by region, and are subject to market cycles that are influenced by worldwide demand from steel and other metal producers as well as by the availability of materials that can be processed into saleable scrap metal, among other factors. Ferrous scrap metal export sales contracts generally provide for shipment within 30 &#32;to 60 &#32;days after the price is agreed to which, in most cases, includes freight. Nonferrous scrap metal sales contracts generally provide for shipment within 30 days after the price is agreed to, which also typically includes freight. 

AMR responds to changes in selling prices by seeking to adjust scrap metal purchase prices at its recycling facilities in order to manage the impact on its operating income. The spread between selling prices and the cost of purchased material is subject to a number of factors, including differences in the market conditions between the domestic regions where unprocessed scrap metal is acquired and the areas in the world where the processed materials are sold, market volatility from the time the selling price is agreed upon with the customer until the time the unprocessed material is purchased, and changes in the estimated costs of transportation to the customer&#8217;s facility. We believe AMR generally benefits from sustained periods of rising recycled scrap metal selling prices, which allow it to better maintain or expand both operating income and unprocessed scrap metal flow into its facilities. When recycled scrap metal selling prices decline, AMR's operating margins typically compress. 

The sales prices for auto parts from salvaged vehicles are deeply discounted from prevailing national new and refurbished sales prices offered at full-service auto dismantlers, retail car parts stores and car dealerships. Our stores provide a list price, available at each location and online. Prices for autobodies sold to third parties and for major component parts, such as engines, transmissions, catalytic converters and alternators sold to wholesalers, are based on prevailing scrap market rates which differ by region and are subject to market cycles. By consolidating shipments of component parts and autobodies, we are able to optimize prices by focusing on larger wholesale customers that pay a premium for volume and consistency of shipments. 

Markets 

Global production of finished steel products drives demand for materials used in the steel-making process, including ferrous recycled scrap metal which is the primary feedstock used in EAFs and can also be used in blast furnaces to manufacture steel. AMR exports ferrous recycled scrap metal primarily to countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region and North, Central and South America. Ferrous exports made up 63% , 60% &#32;and 65% &#32;of AMR's total ferrous sales volume in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. In fiscal 2016, global steel production declined due to slowing global growth rates and a weaker price environment for finished steel as a result of overcapacity in global steel-making. We believe long-term demand for recycled metals will continue to be driven by factors including global infrastructure spending, fixed asset investment, consumer spending, commodity prices, availability of credit, government stimulus programs, and by an increased focus on environmental policies promoting natural resource conservation and the use of recycled metals in the steel-making process compared to alternatives such as iron ore. 

Nonferrous exports made up 64% , 62% &#32;and 65% &#32;of AMR&#8217;s total nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. China and the U.S. have been the largest sales destinations in the nonferrous markets, unlike the ferrous market which is highly diversified with no single country other than the U.S. being the dominant destination for our products from year to year.

Distribution 

AMR delivers recycled ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal to foreign customers by ship and to domestic customers by barge, rail and road transportation networks. Cost efficiencies are achieved by operating deep water terminal facilities at Everett, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Providence, Rhode Island, all of which are owned, except for the Providence, Rhode Island facility which is operated under a long-term lease. We also have access to deep water terminal facilities at Kapolei, Hawaii and Salinas, Puerto Rico through public docks. Our seven deep water terminals enable us to load ferrous material in large vessels capable of holding up to 50,000 tons for trans-oceanic shipments. Additionally, because we own most of the terminal facilities at which AMR operates, AMR is not normally subject to the same berthing delays often experienced by users of unaffiliated terminals. We believe that AMR&#8217;s loading costs are lower than at terminal facilities operated by third parties. From time to time, AMR may enter into contracts of affreightment, which guarantee the availability of ocean going vessels, in order to manage the risks associated with ship availability and freight costs. 

Our nonferrous products are shipped in containers, which hold 20 to 30 tons, from container ports and rail ramps located in close proximity to our recycling facilities. Containerized shipments are exported by marine vessels to customers globally and domestic shipments are typically shipped by rail or by truck. 

AMR sells used auto parts from its self-service retail stores. Once customers have pulled desirable parts from the vehicle, we remove other valuable ferrous and nonferrous parts which are consolidated and shipped primarily to wholesale customers by truck. The salvaged autobodies are crushed and shipped by truck to our metals recycling facilities where geographically feasible, or to third-party recyclers, for shredding. 

Sources of Unprocessed Metal 

The most common forms of purchased unprocessed metal are obsolete machinery and equipment, such as automobiles, railroad cars, railroad tracks, home appliances and other consumer goods, waste metal from manufacturing operations and demolition metal from buildings and other infrastructure. Unprocessed metal is acquired from a diverse base of suppliers who unload at our facilities, from drop boxes at suppliers&#8217; industrial sites and through negotiated purchases from other large suppliers, including railroads, manufacturers, automobile salvage facilities, metal dealers, various government entities and individuals. We typically seek to locate our retail auto parts stores in major population centers with convenient road access. Our auto parts store network spans 15 &#32;states in the U.S. and two provinces in Western Canada, with a majority of the stores concentrated in regions where our large shredders are located. Through our network of auto parts stores, we seek to obtain salvaged vehicles from five primary sources: private parties, tow companies, charities, auto auctions and municipal and other contracts. AMR has a program to purchase vehicles from private parties called &#8220;Cash for Junk Cars&#8221; which is advertised in local markets. Private parties either call a toll-free number and receive a quote for their vehicle or obtain an instant online quote. The private party can either deliver the vehicle to one of our retail locations or arrange for the vehicle to be picked up. AMR also employs car buyers who travel to vendors and bid on vehicles. 

The majority of AMR&#8217;s scrap metal collection and processing facilities receive unprocessed metal via major railroad routes, waterways or highways. Metals recycling facilities situated near metal sellers and major transportation routes have the competitive advantage of reduced freight costs because of the significant cost of freight relative to the cost of metal. The locations of AMR&#8217;s West Coast facilities provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in the Northern California region, northward to Western Canada and Alaska, and to the East, including Idaho, Montana, Utah, Colorado and Nevada. The locations of the East Coast facilities provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in New York, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Eastern Canada and, from time to time, the Midwest. In the Southeastern U.S., approximately half of AMR&#8217;s ferrous and nonferrous unprocessed metal volume is purchased from industrial companies, including auto manufacturers, with the remaining volume being purchased from smaller dealers and individuals. These industrial companies provide AMR with metals that are by-products of their manufacturing processes. 

The supply of scrap metal from these various sources can fluctuate with the level of economic activity in the U.S. and can be sensitive to variability in scrap metal prices, particularly in the short term. The supply of scrap metal can also fluctuate, to a lesser degree, due to seasonal factors, such as severe weather conditions during winter months, which can inhibit scrap metal collections at our facilities. Severe winter and summer weather conditions can also adversely impact retail admissions at our self-service auto parts stores. 

Backlog 

As of September 30, 2016 , AMR had a backlog of orders to sell $55 million &#32;of export ferrous metal compared to $48 million &#32;at the same time in the prior year primarily due to the timing of sales. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016 , AMR had a backlog of orders to sell $31 million &#32;of export nonferrous metal compared to $33 million &#32;in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in selling prices and the timing of sales. We expect to fill the entirety of the backlog of orders for export ferrous and nonferrous metal during fiscal 2017.

Competition 

AMR competes in the U.S. and in Western Canada for the purchase of scrap metal with large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal, steel mills that own scrap yards and, increasingly in recent years, with smaller metal facilities and dealers. AMR's auto stores compete for the purchase of end-of-life vehicles with other auto dismantlers, used car dealers, auto auctions and metal recyclers. In general, the competitive factors impacting the purchase of scrap metal are the price offered by the purchaser and the proximity of the purchaser to the source of scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles. AMR also competes with brokers that buy scrap metal on behalf of domestic and foreign steel mills. 

In recent years, an environment of lower economic growth rates and lower scrap prices constrained scrap generation in the U.S., which led to reduced supply flows of scrap metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and margin compression. During the last three fiscal years, the continued challenging market conditions led to an industry trend of reductions in capacity through idling of equipment and curtailment of operations, including by large and well-capitalized companies, while a number of smaller competitors consolidated or exited the scrap market due to the protracted cyclical downturn. 

AMR competes globally for the sale of processed recycled metal to finished steel and other metal product producers. The predominant competitive factors that impact recycled metal sales are price (including shipping cost), reliability of service, product quality, the relative value of the U.S. dollar and the availability and price of scrap metal and scrap metal substitutes including steel billets. During the last three fiscal years, the increased production and availability of iron ore, a raw material used in steel-making in blast furnaces which compete with EAF steel-making production that uses primarily ferrous scrap, led to prices for iron ore that have been at low levels relative to historical levels. This has been and may continue to be, among other reasons, a contributing factor to weaker demand and lower prices for ferrous scrap in our export markets. While the impact of the availability of low-priced iron ore may continue in the near-term, we believe the significant production efficiencies and environmental benefits associated with EAF steel-making compared to blast furnace steel-making will contribute to worldwide long-term demand for ferrous recycled scrap metal. AMR also competes for the sale of used auto parts to retail customers with other self-service and full-service auto dismantlers. The auto parts industry is characterized by diverse and fragmented competition and comprises a large number of aftermarket and used auto parts suppliers of all sizes, ranging from large, multinational corporations which serve both original equipment manufacturers and the aftermarket on a worldwide basis to small, local entities which have more limited supply. The main competitive factors impacting the retail sale of auto parts are price, availability of product, quality and convenience of the retail stores to customers. 

We believe AMR's ability to process substantial volumes of scrap metal products, state-of-the-art equipment, number of locations, access to a variety of different modes of transportation, geographic dispersion and operational synergies of its integrated platform provide its business with the ability to compete successfully in varying market conditions. 

Steel Manufacturing Business 

Business 

SMB operates a steel mini-mill in McMinnville, Oregon that produces a wide range of finished steel products using recycled metal and other raw materials. AMR is the sole supplier for SMB&#8217;s scrap metal requirements, which SMB purchases at rates that approximate market prices for shipments from the West Coast of the U.S. 

Manufacturing 

SMB&#8217;s melt shop includes an EAF, a ladle refining furnace with enhanced steel chemistry refining capabilities, and a five-strand continuous billet caster, permitting the mill to produce special alloy grades of steel not currently produced by other mills on the West Coast of the U.S. The melt shop produced 499 thousand , 600 thousand &#32;and 580 thousand &#32;short tons of steel in the form of billets during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. SMB reinvests in its melt shop to improve efficiencies in the melting process. 

Through the end of fiscal 2016, SMB also operated two computerized rolling mills that allowed for synchronized operations of the rolling mills and related equipment, providing an effective annual finished goods production capacity of approximately 800 thousand tons. Billets produced in SMB&#8217;s melt shop are reheated in two natural gas-fueled furnaces and are then hot-rolled through one of the two rolling mills to produce finished products. SMB continues to monitor the market for new products and, through discussions with customers, to identify additional opportunities to expand its product lines and sales. 

In August 2016, the Company committed to a plan, to be implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, to shut down and decommission the older and less technologically advanced rolling mill, which was entered into service over 40 years ago, and which in recent years has been producing a smaller proportion of SMB's finished steel products. This plan is being implemented in conjunction with an improvement initiative to enhance the operating efficiency of the newer and more technologically advanced rolling mill, improve product quality, and expand its overall effective annual production capacity. Under current conditions, the continuing rolling mill has an effective annual production capacity of 580 thousand tons of finished steel products.

Products 

SMB produces semi-finished goods (billets) and finished goods, consisting of rebar, coiled rebar, wire rod, merchant bar and other specialty products. Semi-finished goods are predominantly used for SMB&#8217;s finished products, but also have been produced for sale to other steel mills. Rebar is produced in either straight length steel bars or coils and used to increase the strength of poured concrete. Coiled rebar is preferred by some manufacturers because it reduces the waste generated by cutting individual lengths to meet customer specifications and, therefore, improves yield. Wire rod is steel rod, delivered in coiled form, used by manufacturers to produce a variety of products such as chain link fencing, nails, wire, stucco netting, and pre-stressed concrete strand. Merchant bar consists of round, flat and square steel bars used by manufacturers to produce a wide variety of products, including gratings, steel floor and roof joists, safety walkways, ornamental furniture, stair railings, and farm equipment. SMB is also certified to produce high-quality rebar to support nuclear power plant construction and has a license to produce certain patented high-strength specialty steels. 

The table below sets forth, on a revenue and volume basis, the sales of finished steel products during the last three fiscal years ended August 31:

Distribution 

SMB sells directly from its mini-mill in McMinnville, Oregon and its owned distribution center in City of Industry, California (Los Angeles area). Products are shipped from the mini-mill to the distribution center primarily by rail. The distribution center facilitates sales by maintaining an inventory of products close to major customers for just-in-time delivery. SMB communicates regularly with major customers to determine their anticipated needs and plans its rolling mill production schedule accordingly. Shipments to customers are made by common carrier, primarily truck or rail. 

Supply of Scrap Metal 

We believe SMB operates the only mini-mill in the Western U.S. that obtains its scrap metal requirements from an affiliated metal recycler. AMR provides a mix of recycled metal grades to SMB, which allows SMB to achieve optimum efficiency in its melting operations. 

&#32;8 &#32;/ Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016 

&#32; SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. 

Energy Supply 

SMB needs a significant amount of electricity to run its operations, primarily its EAF. SMB purchases electricity under a long-term contract with McMinnville Water &#38; Light (&#8220;MW&#38;L&#8221;), which in turn relies on the Bonneville Power Administration (&#8220;BPA&#8221;). We entered into our current contract with MW&#38;L in October 2011 that will expire in September 2028. 

SMB also needs a significant amount of natural gas to run its reheat furnaces, which are used to reheat billets prior to running them through the rolling mills. SMB meets this demand through a natural gas agreement with a utility provider that obligates SMB at each month-end to purchase a volume of gas based on its projected needs for the immediately subsequent month on a take-or-pay basis priced using published natural gas indices. 

Energy costs represented 7% &#32;of SMB&#8217;s cost of goods sold in fiscal 2016 , and 5% &#32;in each of fiscal 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

Backlog 

SMB generally ships products within days after the receipt of a purchase order. As of September 30, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , SMB had a backlog of orders of $5 million &#32;and $13 million , respectively. 

Competition 

SMB&#8217;s primary domestic competitors for the sale of finished steel products include Nucor Corporation&#8217;s manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Utah and Washington; Gerdau Long Steel North America&#8217;s facility in California; and Commercial Metals Company&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Arizona. In addition to domestic competition, SMB competes with foreign steel producers, principally located in Asia, Canada, Mexico and Central and South America, primarily in shorter length rebar and certain wire rod grades. In recent years, a trend of increasing volumes of imported steel products has been observed in SMB's primary domestic markets, driven by the global overcapacity in steel-making production and by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar which increases the competitiveness of imports. The principal competitive factors in SMB&#8217;s market are price, quality, service, product availability and the relative value of the U.S. dollar. 

Large volumes of low-priced imports have negatively impacted, and have the potential to continue to negatively impact, the ability of SMB to compete. For more than a decade, SMB, as part of a U.S. industry coalition, has petitioned the U.S. Government under our international trade laws for relief in the form of antidumping and countervailing duties against wire rod and rebar products from a number of foreign countries. Many of those cases have been successful and as of the start of fiscal 2016, antidumping duty orders were in effect related to imports of rebar from Belarus, China, Indonesia, Latvia, Mexico, Moldova, Poland and Ukraine; a countervailing duty order was in effect related to imports of rebar from Turkey; antidumping duty orders were in effect related to imports of wire rod from Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Moldova and Trinidad and Tobago; and a countervailing duty order was in effect related to imports of wire rod from Brazil. The duties imposed as part of these orders are periodically reassessed through the administrative review process. In addition, every five years the U.S. government conducts sunset reviews to determine whether revocation of the orders would likely lead to resumption of dumping and subsidization and negatively impact the U.S. domestic industry. Affirmative decisions allow the orders to continue for an additional five years. The next sunset reviews for rebar from Belarus, China, Indonesia, Latvia, Moldova, Poland and Ukraine will be in 2017, and for Mexico and Turkey will be in 2019. The next sunset reviews for wire rod from all countries other than China will be in 2017, with the Chinese sunset review scheduled for 2020. 

During fiscal 2016, the domestic industry prevailed in an anti-circumvention case related to the Mexican wire rod antidumping duty order. The result of the determination is that the scope of that order will encompass a broader range of wire rod products, potentially reducing wire rod imports. At the same time, antidumping margins on several large Mexican wire rod manufacturers were reduced significantly in the administrative review process. 

In August 2016, following a petition from the Canadian domestic industry, the Canada Border Services Agency initiated an antidumping duty investigation of rebar from Belarus, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Japan, Portugal and Spain. That case is pending, but if successful, will result in antidumping duty orders against rebar from those countries which, with the current orders against rebar from China, Korea and Turkey, are expected to generally lead to a reduction in the volume of imports into Canada from these countries. 

In September 2016, the domestic industry filed a new petition targeting rebar from Japan, Taiwan and Turkey. The petition alleges dumping of Japanese and Taiwanese rebar, and dumping and unfair subsidization of Turkish rebar imports, which would apply to any producers not subject to the current order discussed above. The U.S. International Trade Commission will make its preliminary injury determination in November and, if that is affirmative, the case will proceed. 

The long-term effectiveness of existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders related to imports of wire rod and rebar products is largely uncertain and is impacted by the U.S. Government's ability to efficiently identify and respond to violations of U.S. international trade laws affecting SMB's business.

Strategic Focus 

Use of our Operating Platform to Meet Both Domestic and Global Demand 

Our AMR operating platform includes a wide-ranging network of locations that allows us to directly access customers domestically and around the world to meet demand for recycled metal wherever it is greatest. Our seven deep water terminal facilities enable us to bulk load large vessels capable of trans-oceanic shipments, thereby allowing us to efficiently ship products globally. We achieve cost efficiencies because we own the majority of these terminal facilities, which reduces the likelihood of berthing delays often experienced by users of unaffiliated terminals, and because we are able to ship bulk cargoes of up to 50,000 tons, which generally have lower freight costs on a per-ton basis than containerized shipments that hold 20 to 30 tons. We also use an internal and third-party logistics network to transport both ferrous and nonferrous metals by truck, rail and barge to efficiently meet regional domestic demand in our North American market. 

Continuous Improvement Initiatives 

We are a competitive producer of both recycled metal and finished steel products. In order to maximize the operating income for both operations, we have historically focused on, and will continue to emphasize, continuous improvement programs, including productivity initiatives and technology investments which seek to maximize ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal recovery and to improve productivity in our steel manufacturing operations. The objective of these programs is to identify areas in existing processes that could be made more efficient or where current performance could be improved and to recommend and implement solutions that could increase revenues or reduce costs by increasing output, recovery and productivity. 

In recent years, we undertook a number of productivity improvements and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability, including further integration among our operating platforms. In fiscal 2014, we implemented productivity improvement and restructuring initiatives which achieved a reduction in annual pre-tax operating costs of $40 million and were completed by the end of fiscal 2015. The benefits associated with these initiatives occurred primarily as a result of a combination of headcount reductions, implementation of operational efficiencies, reduced lease costs and other productivity improvements. 

In fiscal 2015, we initiated and implemented restructuring initiatives including idling underutilized metals recycling assets and closing seven auto parts stores to more closely align our business to the prevalent market conditions. We also implemented measures focused on further reducing our annual operating expenses at Corporate and AMR through headcount reductions, reducing organizational layers, consolidating shared services functions and other non-headcount measures. Additional cost savings and productivity improvement initiatives, including additional reductions in personnel, savings from procurement activities, streamlining of administrative and supporting services functions, and adjustments to our operating capacity through additional facility closures, were identified and initiated in fiscal 2016 as an expansion of the fiscal 2015 restructuring initiatives. Together, these fiscal 2015 and 2016 initiatives target an improvement in annual pre-tax operating results of $95 million , of which we achieved approximately $78 million &#32;of benefits in our fiscal 2016 results, with the full annual benefits expected to be substantially achieved in fiscal 2017. See Note 8 &#32;- Discontinued Operations and Note 10 &#32;- Restructuring Charges and Other Exit-Related Activities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details. 

During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , we spent $35 million , $32 million &#32;and $39 million , respectively, on capital improvements. These capital expenditures primarily reflect our significant investments in modern equipment to improve the efficiency and capabilities of our businesses in order to further maximize our economies of scale and to comply with environmental regulations. Our capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 &#32;included costs to upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and expand on our investments in environmental and safety-related assets. We currently plan to invest in the range of $45 million &#32;in capital expenditures on similar projects in fiscal 2017 , exclusive of any acquisitions. 

Integrated Operations Maximize Opportunities for Synergies, Cost Efficiencies and Volumes 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we combined our auto parts and metals recycling businesses into a single operating platform to further optimize the efficiencies within the platform, enable additional synergies to be captured throughout our supply chain and global sales channel, and more effectively leverage our shared services functions. Through our integrated operating platform, we also seek to generate operational efficiencies through the use of regionally-based supply networks and national commercial market activities. Operations at 97 &#32;facilities support relationships within our existing and potential supply channels to maximize available volumes, and our commercial flexibility and management operating systems benefit the entire value chain, which enhances our ability to adjust to market changes. In addition, we have implemented operational efficiencies and cost savings through the reduction of management layers and consolidated shared services functions including in finance, information technology, non-scrap procurement, environmental, safety and human resources functions.

Environmental Matters 

Impact of Legislation and Regulation 

Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our operations. Our businesses are subject to extensive local, state and federal environmental protection, health, safety and transportation laws and regulations relating to, among others: 

&#8226; 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

Remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;); 

&#8226; 

The discharge of materials and emissions into the air; 

&#8226; 

The prevention and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination; 

&#8226; 

The management and treatment of wastewater and storm water; 

&#8226; 

Global climate change; 

&#8226; 

The treatment, handling and/or disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste; and 

&#8226; 

The protection of our employees&#8217; health and safety. 

These environmental laws regulate, among other things, the release and discharge of hazardous materials into the air, water and ground; exposure to hazardous materials; and the identification, storage, treatment, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. Environmental legislation and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years, and it is likely that we will be subject to even more stringent environmental standards in the future. 

Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international regulatory and legislative initiatives to limit greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA was authorized to regulate carbon dioxide under the U.S. Clean Air Act. As a consequence, the EPA initiated a series of regulatory efforts aimed at addressing greenhouse gases as pollutants, including finding that GHG emissions endanger public health, implementing mandatory GHG emission reporting requirements, setting carbon emission standards for light-duty vehicles and taking other steps to address GHG emissions. Legislation has also been proposed in the U.S. Congress to address GHG emissions and global climate change, including &#8220;cap and trade&#8221; programs, and some form of federal climate change legislation or additional federal regulation is possible. In addition, we are required to annually report GHG emissions from our steel mill to the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and the EPA. A number of other states, including states in which we have operations and facilities, have considered, are considering or have already enacted legislation to develop information or address climate change and GHG emissions, as well. 

Although our objective is to maintain compliance with applicable environmental regulations, we have, in the past, been found to be not in compliance with certain environmental laws and regulations and have incurred liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with such violations. In December 2000, we were notified by the EPA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties that owns or operates, or formerly owned or operated, sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (see discussion in Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A and Note 9 &#32;&#8211; Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report). In fiscal 2016 , capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance were $14 million , and we expect to spend in the range of $19 million &#32;on capital expenditures for ongoing environmental compliance in fiscal 2017 . 

Indirect Consequences of Future Legislation and Regulation 

Increased regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs in order to comply with regulations concerning climate change and GHG emissions. The potential costs of allowances, offsets or credits that may be part of &#8220;cap and trade&#8221; programs or similar future regulatory measures are still uncertain. Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Furthermore, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the metals recycling and steel manufacturing industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our products. 

GHG legislation and regulation is also expected to have an effect on the price of electricity, especially when generated using carbon-based fuels. Since the electricity supply for SMB includes a significant element of hydro-generated production, SMB&#8217;s energy costs are less likely to be impacted than those of competitors using electricity generated by carbon-based fuels. In addition, demand for scrap metal may increase as a result of mills with blast furnaces seeking to maximize the scrap metal component of raw material infeed, as melting scrap metal involves less energy than is required for melting iron ore. 

&#32;11 &#32;/ Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. Form 10-K 2016 

&#32; SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. 

Since the use of recycled iron and steel instead of iron ore to make new steel results in savings in the consumption of energy, virgin materials and water and reduces mining wastes, we believe our recycled metal products position us to be more competitive in the future for business from companies wishing to reduce their carbon footprint and impact on the environment. In addition, our EAF generates significantly less GHG emissions than traditional blast furnaces. 

Physical Impacts of Climate Change on Our Costs and Operations 

There has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with rising sea levels as well as extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms. Extreme weather conditions may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. As many of our recycling facilities are located near deep water ports, significantly rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to receive scrap metal, process the scrap metal through our mega-shredders and ship product to our customers. Periods of extended adverse weather conditions may inhibit the supply of scrap metal to AMR and SMB. In addition, sustained periods of increased temperature levels in the summer in areas where our retail auto parts operations are located could result in less customer traffic, thus resulting in reduced admissions and parts sales. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016 , we had 2,818 &#32;full-time employees, consisting of 2,245 &#32;employees at AMR, 406 &#32;employees at SMB and 167 &#32;corporate administrative employees. Of these employees, 639 &#32;were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The SMB contract with the United Steelworkers of America, which covers 293 &#32;of these employees, was renewed and ratified in April 2016 and will expire on March 31, 2019 . We believe that in general our labor relations are good.
