 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

Diego is a real estate and a consumer retail development company that is focused on developing &#8220;Diego Pellicer&#8221; as the world&#8217;s first &#8220;premium&#8221; marijuana brand by adhering to the highest quality and standards for its facilities along with both cannabis and non-cannabis products. The Company&#8217;s initial focus is to acquire and develop legally compliant real estate locations for the purposes of leasing them to state licensed companies in the cannabis industry. Diego does not grow or sell marijuana or marijuana infused products in the early stages of this plan. 

&#160; 

Diego&#8217;s initial revenues derive from leasing real estate and selling non-cannabis related products; however, when it is federally legal to do so, Diego will be properly positioned to take advantage of pre-negotiated acquisition contracts with selected Diego tenants in marijuana retail and production facilities throughout the country. Diego&#8217;s business model will allow it to become a nationally branded marijuana retailer and producer, instantaneously, with the change of federal law. The Company will not implement this business model until it becomes legal under federal law to sell and produce marijuana. 

&#160; 

To operate within the constraints set forth by the US government, the purpose of this business plan is to describe Diego; however, to better describe the future growth plan for the Company, we will also describe the grow and retail operations of other entities with which Diego has pre-negotiated acquisition contracts or plans to have pre-negotiated acquisition contracts in the future. At this time, we only have one pre-negotiated acquisition contract in place with Diego Pellicer, Inc. a Washington Corporation. These external operations are presented as DP Grow and DP Retail, and the results of these operations as presented will not directly benefit Diego until after Federal legalization. 

&#160; 

Merger and Share Exchange Agreement 

&#160; 

On March 13, 2015 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc. (f/k/a Type 1 Media, Inc.)

In connection with the closing of the Merger, on the Closing Date, Jonathan White and Thomas Baxter submitted to the Company a resignation letter pursuant to which they resigned from their positions as officers and members of the Board of Directors of the Company. Messrs. White and Baxter&#8217;s resignations were not a result of any disagreements relating to the Company&#8217;s operations, policies or practices. On the Closing Date, the board of directors of the Company (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) and the majority stockholders of the Company (the &#8220;Shareholders&#8221;) accepted the resignations of Messrs. White and Baxter and, contemporaneously appointed: (i) Philip Gay to serve as the Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors, (ii) Ron Throgmartin to act as Chief Operating Officer, (iii) Nick Roberts to act as Chief Financial Officer; and (iv) Alan Valdes, Douglas Anderson, and Stephen Norris to serve as members of the Board of Directors.

Subsequent to the Merger and Share Exchange Agreement, on May 22, 2015, Philip Gay resigned as the Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the board of directors, and Nick Roberts resigned as Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Gay and Mr. Roberts resignations were not the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operation, policies (including accounting or financial policies), or practices. The board of directors of the Company appointed Ron Throgmartin, the Company&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer as the Chief Executive Officer and David R.

&#160; 

Our Corporate History and Background 

&#160; 

Diego Pellicer Inc. was formed in the state of Washington of December 5, 2012, with the intent to produce and sell cannabis in the state of Washington. The Company determined that in order to be successful and avoid any potential violation of federal law, it would form a new corporation that would not produce or sell cannabis directly. Therefore, Diego Pellicer Worldwide, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation, on August 26, 2013. The Company was developed to position itself in such a way that if the cannabis industry were to federally legalize, then it would be in an advantageous position to quickly become one of the first luxury integrated brands in the industry. Currently, the Company&#8217;s focus is to acquire and develop legally compliant real estate locations for the purposes of leasing them to state licensed companies in the cannabis industry. Diego does not grow or sell marijuana or marijuana infused products at this time.

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Mission 

&#160; 

At this time, Diego Pellicer is a development stage company and is only in the early stages of implementing its business plan. In states where recreational and/or medical marijuana sales and cultivation is legal under State law, the Company plans to lease property to tenants who will grow and/or sell the highest quality of marijuana. As a tenant of Diego, these operators will have access to Diego&#8217;s world class management team with expertise in real estate, retail management, agriculture and USDA experts, legal, marketing and branding, product development and creative teams. 

&#160; 

When the US and countries around the world legalize commerce of marijuana on a national and international platform, Diego hopes to be in a position to dominate the marijuana marketplace. Diego will accomplish this by positioning the Company, through its business model, to be the first fully integrated marijuana retail operation and premium brand, known for its beautifully designed user friendly retail stores offering the finest quality products at competitive prices, when the US and other countries legalize the sale of marijuana. 

&#160; 

Philosophy 

&#160; 

We believe that legalizing marijuana, regulating it and taxing it, will cause less harm and do more good than the prohibition environment. We believe marijuana should be elevated to its proper place among other legal recreational intoxicants such as fine wines, liquors, beers, cigars, etc. There is an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence that supports our philosophy, as well as a growing number of supporters ranging from high-ranking US and foreign politicians to prominent figures in the entertainment industry. In addition, we believe that legalization will help unlock the phenomenal power of cannabis as a medicinal treatment for numerous ailments from headaches to cancer. 

&#160; 

Brand History 

&#160; 

Diego Pellicer was a Spanish colonial vice governor of Cebu, a major island in the Philippine archipelago. He grew to become the largest grower of hemp in the world and is our name sake. He serves as an inspiration to our executive team, as well as distinctive brand befitting the quality of Diego Pellicer Worldwide. 

&#160; 

Vision 

&#160; 

Our vision is to continue to develop Diego Pellicer as a premium brand that is valued and positioned to appeal to a broad customer base. 

&#160; 

In addition, Diego believes that in the very near future, the US and other countries will embrace the will of the people, and legalize the responsible adult use of marijuana. Legalizing national and international commerce of marijuana, will allow Diego to take its brand and unmatched quality standards to markets all around the globe. 

&#160; 

Value Proposition 

&#160; 

The initial value proposition of Diego consists of a standardized approach to the build-outs of real estate holdings, customized for premium marijuana grow and retail operations. The build-out model is optimized to maximize resources while minimizing costs and overhead. With each build-out, Diego pre-negotiates with select tenants, acquisition contracts with licensed DP Grow and DP Retail tenants, which, upon changes to federal law, introduces our second value proposition&#8212;ownership of operations from seed to sale in an industry that is projected to exceed $8 billion by 2018 and we hope will soon rival that of traditional markets such as tobacco and alcohol. 

&#160; 

Market Size 

&#160; 

The US state-sanctioned medical and recreational marijuana market generated a total revenue of $5.4 billion in 2015, boosted by an incredible growth in the recreational sector of sales, from $351M to $998M, an estimated increase of 184% over 2014. By comparison, the marijuana market is less than 3% of the US tobacco market, a $144 billion market that has no medicinal value, and less than 3% of the alcohol market, which valued at $113.5 billion in 2014 ( Marijuana Business Daily 2016; 2016 Statistic Brain Research Institute). As states legalize marijuana, and international markets develop, the emerging legalized marijuana industry will begin to rival that of tobacco and alcohol and could see $45B in revenues by 2020. 

&#160; 

Target Geographies 

&#160; 

Diego has entered a rapid growth and expansion stage in its evolution toward becoming an internationally recognized brand. The target geographies for Diego are all US states in which recreational or medicinal marijuana is legalized. This is a phased implementation that carefully pre-stages funding and materials to be first to market, as each state rules on legalization. In certain scenarios, Diego may choose to allow weak competitors to fail, making available prime real estate that otherwise would be inaccessible. 

&#160; 

Target Consumers 

&#160; 

There are an estimated 1.5 million medical marijuana patients in the US and more than 4,500 retailers. California and Washington have the largest number of marijuana patients at more than 775,000 for each state, followed by Michigan at 344,000 and Colorado with 107,534. ( Marijuana Business Daily 2016). 

&#160; 

The demographics for consumers that have tried marijuana at least once, range between ages 18 to 49, with the greatest numbers between the ages 26 and 34. These consumers are predominantly male and college educated. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Alaska has the fastest growing population of potential consumers, followed by Washington DC, Colorado, New Mexico and Hawaii, with Washington just a few points below. In 2012, Montana, Colorado, California, and Washington had the greatest increase in disposable income, thus increasing the breadth of target consumers. 

&#160; 

Material Agreements 

&#160; 

On April 19, 2014, the Company entered into a commercial agreement and merger agreement with Diego Pellicer, Inc., a Washington corporation (&#8220;Diego Washington&#8221;).

Our Industry 

&#160; 

We are in a burgeoning industry, centered on the production and sales of medical and recreational marijuana. Diego Pellicer is focused on providing legally compliant retail and production facilities to State licensed operators. In addition, Diego Pellicer offers branding opportunities to state licensed producers and retailers that meet our stringent qualifications. 

&#160; 

In addition to providing fully branded and built real estate to qualified tenants, Diego Pellicer offers non-cannabis infused products, apparel, and other tangible products at a wholesale rate. To become a qualified tenant, Diego requires its tenants to strictly adhere to testing and labeling requirements along with all state laws and federal guidelines to assure quality and consistency of marijuana products, ensuring safe sale and consumption. Table 7 provides a list of our current property portfolio. 

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Market Definition and Roles 

&#160; 

The marijuana market consists of medical and recreational regulators, producers, testers, processors, wholesalers, retailers, collectives, consumers and real estate holders. Since data pertaining to specific aspects of marijuana sales, such as processor revenues, is virtually non-existent for the marijuana market, the market is valued according to retail sales data provided by state and federal governing bodies. Below is a brief summary of each role: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Regulators: State and federal lawmakers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Producer or Grower: Cash crop farmers and grow shops. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Tester: Testers of marijuana for quality and other required measures. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Processor or Infuser: Processers of marijuana into a commercial product (flower, concentrates, and edibles). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Wholesaler: Buyers from producers or processors that sell in bulk to other processers and retailers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Retailer: For profit (proprietorship, partnerships, or for-profit business) sellers to consumers and patients. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Collective or Cooperative: Non-profit organizations selling mostly to patients. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Recreational Consumers or Patients (local and marijuana tourist): Consumers of marijuana products, recreationally or by medical prescription. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Real Estate Holdings: Companies that specialize in building-out and managing real estate for all aspects of operations (e.g., grow, retail, processing and packaging, etc.) &#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Market Strategy 

&#160; 

Our short-term strategy is to profit only from the lease payments of our real estate holdings and from the sale of branded, non-cannabis products. Diego will have pre-negotiated acquisition contracts with selected tenants that trigger only when it is legal, or not illegal, to conduct interstate commerce in marijuana. We intend to enter into branding agreements with our tenants going forward that will require our tenants to have certain quality controls and procedures to ensure our they comply with the law, safety and quality. In addition, part of the vetting process in finding the proper tenant is selecting a tenant that shares the Company&#8217;s values and strictly complies with state laws, safety and testing requirements and provides consistent, high-quality products. If the tenants do not comply, they will not be allowed to use the brand. At this time, we have one pre-negotiated acquisition contract in place with Diego Pellicer Worldwide Washington and are in the process of negotiating additional pre-negotiated acquisition contracts with other tenants. 

&#160; 

The three pillars of our strategy are: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Acquire compliant properties legally, and build-out high-quality marijuana grow and retail locations, and lease these locations to tenants that are stand-alone, independent corporations with the ability to meet Diego Pellicer quality and branding standards &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. While initially Diego does not have an ownership stake in grow or retail companies, our strategy is to execute pre-negotiated acquisition contracts with its select tenants whereby Diego has the exclusive option to acquire these independent operator lessees. These options shall only be executed when and if the company deems it sufficiently legal to do so and there is no guarantee these options will be exercised. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Develop and sell quality non-cannabis ancillary products including apparel, luxury merchandise products, non-cannabis chocolates and pastries, just to name a few. These products will be sold in DP retail outlets where allowed or in proximate independent stores. &#160; 

A very important aspect of our marketing plan is to build Diego Pellicer as a luxury brand. This not only enables us to establish further and exploit Diego Pellicer as a premium brand, but also to generate significant revenues off of non-cannabis products. 

&#160; 

Market Size 

&#160; 

The US marijuana market has experienced rapid, chaotic growth in recent years, which is set to continue beyond the forecast target of 2019 due primarily to regulatory misalignment between state and federal governments. 

&#160; 

The marijuana secondary and tertiary markets have not yet been analyzed as sources of revenue; however, emerging secondary markets such as marijuana tourism could become a significant source of income for recreational legal states. As a point of comparison, Holland earns $48.55 billion per year in tourist dollars. Of the 10 million tourists, 5.5 million or 55% of tourists visit bars and cafes, generating a total of nearly $27 billion and 220,000 jobs (NBTC, 2009). This equals roughly 30% of all business revenue generated in Washington state in 2012 (Washington State Department of Revenue, 2014). 

&#160; 

The US state-sanctioned medical and recreational marijuana market generated a total revenue of $5.4 billion in 2015, boosted by an incredible growth in the recreational sector of sales, from $351M to $998M.=, an estimated increase of 184% over 2014. By comparison, the marijuana market is less than 3% of the US tobacco market, a $144 billion market that has no medicinal value, and less than 3% of the alcohol market, which valued at $113.5 billion in 2014 (2016 Statistic Brain Research Institute). As states legalize marijuana, and international markets develop, the emerging legalized marijuana industry will begin to rival that of tobacco and alcohol and could see $45B in revenues by 2020. 

&#160; 

Marijuana has become a major issue in state elections as voters are seeking politicians that support legalization (Gutwillig, 2014). As states legalize marijuana, and international markets develop, the emerging legalized marijuana industry will begin to rival that of tobacco and alcohol. Table 1 summarizes 2016 estimated revenues generated by marijuana retail sales based on a number of sources, including state marijuana program reports.

Figure 2 illustrates the market structure by state and estimated retail sales revenues for 2016. Of the 24 states in which marijuana is legal, Colorado is expected to generated the most revenue at $51,100M, followed by California at $1,000M and Washington at $775M. Most States operating in 2014 experienced double and triple digit growth into 2015, with the exception to California, which has leveled out.

Various industry reports estimate that marijuana sales could generate as much as $8.7 billion in state and federal taxes; however, data to support that estimate is not yet available. ( Marijuana Business Daily 2016) 

&#160; 

Market Growth 

&#160; 

The performance of the market is forecast to accelerate, with an anticipated growth of an average of 27% over the next four years to an expected market value greater than $45 billion by the end of 2020. Table 2 and Figure 3 provide estimated market growth from 2011 to 2018. This growth assumes that no additional states legalize. If additional states legalize, growth estimates will likely increase significantly.

Market Distribution 

&#160; 

Market distribution must be measured indirectly with registered medical consumers and dispensaries. As expected, California has the largest number of marijuana patients at more than 775,000, followed by Michigan at 179,000 and Colorado with 107,000. Washington is at 125,000 registered patients as listed in Table 3 and illustrated in Figure 4. There are currently an estimated 1.5 million medical marijuana patients in the US.

&#160; 

Another indirect measure of market distribution is the number of medical marijuana dispensaries. Table 4 and Figure 5 provide the distribution of dispensaries across the US. The number of patients and dispensaries are mostly aligned; however, certain states such as Michigan have much higher ratio of patients to dispensaries than other states. This could be the result of inaccurate data.

Competitive Analysis and Benchmarking 

&#160; 

Diego was one of the first to the market with a real estate holding and branding business model; however, other companies have since adopted similar strategies. Key differentiators between Diego and its competitors are superior branding, optimized build-out and turnkey grow and retail development, and, most importantly, pre-negotiated acquisition contracts. As with other marijuana-related financial data, collecting benchmark data on Diego competitors was especially challenging in that many of these companies fail to report or are unable to report the fundamentals of financial information. Table 5 provides a financial benchmark of Diego&#8217;s nearest competitors.

Tourism Effect 

&#160; 

The secondary and tertiary effects of the marijuana market have received little attention by market analyst; however, markets such as marijuana tourism could become a significant source of revenue for recreationally legal states. For example, The Netherlands earns $48.55 billion per year in tourist dollars. Of the 10M tourists, 5.5 million or 55% visit marijuana bars and cafes, generating a total of nearly $27 billion and 220,000 jobs. Likewise, Colorado reported note that marijuana tourism is responsible for 90% of all retail sales in resort towns (Weissmann, 2014). 

&#160; 

Peak Sales and Product Segmentation 

&#160; 

Peak marijuana sales occur during two calendar periods: December/January and July/August. Smokable Marijuana sales exceed other product categories representing 87% of the market, which is followed by concentrates at 7% and edibles at 4% while drinks, topicals, accessories and clones generate the least amount of revenue at less than 1% each. The top marijuana product according to an analysis of a market leading dispensary is Bruce Banner followed by 303 Kush.

Legalization by State 

&#160; 

Support for medical and recreational marijuana use has increased significantly over the past 20 years. According to a recent CNN poll, greater than 50% of the US population supports marijuana legalization. Figure 6 illustrates a select set of CNN poll results. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Two states, Colorado and Washington, have passed legislation for recreational marijuana. As the popularity of recreational marijuana becomes more accepted by Americans, it is the Company&#8217;s belief that several of the States in which medical marijuana is currently legal will likely follow suit and legalize recreational marijuana. States are learning from one another, refining legislation and establishing realistic tax strategies. The Obama administration has pledged to end Federal raids on state-sanctioned dispensaries (Furlow, 2012). Similar movements are occurring in other democratic countries such as Australia in which several states have decriminalized possession (Thies, 2012). Table 6 lists recreational and medicinal marijuana legalization status by state.

Target Geographies 

&#160; 

Diego has entered a rapid growth and expansion stage in its evolution toward becoming an internationally recognized brand. The target geographies for Diego are all US states in which recreational or medicinal marijuana is legalized. This is a phased implementation that carefully pre-stages funding and materials to be first to market, as each state rules on legalization. In certain scenarios, Diego may choose to allow weak competitors to fail, making available prime real estate that otherwise would be inaccessible. 

&#160; 

Target Consumers 

&#160; 

There are an estimated 1.5M medical marijuana patients in the US and over 5,000 retailers. California has the largest number of marijuana patients at more than 775,000, followed by Colorado with 625,000 and Michigan at 179,000. Washington is a close 4th at 125,000 registered patients. 

&#160; 

The demographics for consumers that have tried marijuana at least once, range between ages 18 to 49, with the greatest numbers between the ages 26 and 34. These consumers are predominantly male, and college educated. 

&#160; 

Alaska has the fastest growing population of potential consumers, followed by Washington DC, Colorado, New Mexico and Hawaii, with Washington just a few points below. In 2012, Montana, Colorado, California, and Washington had the greatest increase in disposable income, thus increasing the breadth of target consumers. 

&#160; 

Future Markets 

&#160; 

Studies on marijuana use in The Netherlands have demonstrated that the availability of marijuana in caf&#233;&#8217;s has had very little effect on increasing or decreasing marijuana use (MacCoun, 2011). As such, the next progression in the US market, following Federal legalization, is the establishment of caf&#233;&#8217;s or other types of service centers for marijuana consumption. The number of caf&#233;&#8217;s in The Netherlands has ranged between 700 and 800 over the past 15 years, and currently operates about 700 or 1 per 29,000 citizens, employing 4,000 workers and generating $832.2M annually (Monshouwer, Van Laar, and Vollebergh, 2011). Extrapolating this to the US market would indicate approximately 10,000 caf&#233;&#8217;s and service centers where actual consumption of cannabis can take place. 

&#160; 

Primary Service 

&#160; 

Our primary service is fully branded and built real estate to qualified tenants. Our branding includes non-cannabis infused products, apparel, and other tangible products at a wholesale rate. To become a qualified tenant, Diego requires its tenants to strictly adhere to testing and labeling requirements along with all state laws and federal guidelines to assure quality and consistency of marijuana products, ensuring safe sale and consumption. Table 7 provides a list of our current property portfolio.

Diego Pellicer creates a user friendly customer experience regardless of venue or form of media making it easy and safe for them to purchase. A major aspect of our marketing plan is to inform and educate consumers in a way that allows them to rely on DP as a trusted and valued brand. DP information and products will be available in all forms of media with a variety of different forms of content including videos, social media, online newsletters and blogs and TV. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Consumers will find Diego on websites and via online syndication at web portals, mobile and video destinations (Yahoo!, MSN, Google/YouTube, Hulu, Verizon, etc.) as a dedicated selling platform that will serve Diego created video as information and entertainment. The Company will not develop a website that sells marijuana or marijuana-infused products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Consumers will find our custom content via a cooperative syndication platform in which product partners leverage each other&#8217;s audiences for the distribution of their content and products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Through events in Diego stores and outlets &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Mass audiences could find Diego on network or cable television as the setting for a reality show or documentary series. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Mobile marketing and Mobile apps &#160; 

This will give our brand, products and content the flexibility and portability that consumers demand. This digital syndication strategy will be executed through a series of revenue sharing deals with partners through viral seeding strategies and via paid media through specific targeted websites and venues.

Revenue Generation and Growth 

&#160; 

Diego generates current revenue and stages future revenue streams through the following processes: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Acquire via lease or purchase, target properties to be improved for the growing, processing, distribution, and sale of medical and recreational marijuana, extracts and ancillary products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Sub-leases or leases these properties to state licensed operators. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Capitalizes, where possible, on the build-out and leases near turnkey Retail, Processing and/or Growing facilities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Creates future merger agreements with those operators deem capable of carrying the Diego brand. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Hold Merger Agreements with Diego and other favored partners that will trigger when marijuana commerce becomes legal (or not illegal) federally. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Own DP Brands and other Intellectual Property (IP) in all places filed. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Charge reasonable Market Net-Rents to the store owners/Operators to recover all build-out and start-up investment plus profit margin over the first lease term (generally five years.) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Sell non-cannabis branded products lines such as apparel and edibles at wholesale to leased stores. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Create an e-commerce platform selling non-cannabis branded merchandise &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Continue to build and market the brand utilizing all forms of media including traditional and digital media, social media, e-commerce, and strategic partners. &#160; 

U.S. Federal Law 

&#160; 

While marijuana is legal under the laws of several U.S. States (with vastly differing restrictions), at the present time, the concept of &#8220;medical marijuana&#8221; and &#8220;retail marijuana&#8221; do not exist under U.S. federal law. The United States Federal Controlled Substances Act classifies &#8220;marijuana&#8221; as a Schedule I drug. Under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of safety for the use of the drug under medical supervision. 

&#160; 

The United States Supreme Court has ruled in a number of cases that the federal government does not violate the federal constitution by regulating and criminalizing cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalizes its use for medicinal purposes. 

&#160; 

In a memorandum dated August 29, 2013 addressed to &#8220;All United States Attorneys&#8221; from James M. Cole, Deputy Attorney General (&#8220;Cole Memo&#8221;), the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged that certain U.S. States had enacted laws relating to the use of marijuana and outlined the U.S. federal government&#8217;s enforcement priorities with respect to marijuana notwithstanding the fact that certain U.S. States have legalized or decriminalized the use, sale and manufacture of marijuana: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preventing the diversion of marijuana from U.S. states where it is legal under state law in some form to other U.S. states; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preventing U.S. state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preventing marijuana possession or use on U.S. federal property. &#160; 

There is no guarantee that the current presidential administration will not change its stated policy regarding the low-priority enforcement of U.S. federal laws that conflict with state laws. Additionally, any new U.S. federal government administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the U.S. federal laws vigorously. Any such change in the U.S. federal government&#8217;s enforcement of current U.S. federal laws could cause adverse financial impact to the Company&#8217;s business. See &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

&#160; 

In February 2014, FinCEN issued guidelines allowing banks to legally provide financial services to Licensed Operators that hold a valid License (&#8220;FinCEN Memo&#8221;). The rules re-iterated the guidance provided by the Cole Memo, stating that banks can do business with Licensed Operators and &#8220;may not&#8221; be prosecuted. The guidelines provide that &#8220;it is possible [for the banks] to provide financial services&#8221; to Licensed Operators and while remaining in compliance with federal anti-money laundering laws. The guidance falls short of the explicit legal authorization that banking industry officials anticipated and the outcome of the banks relying on this guidance in transacting with Licensed Operators is currently unclear.
