 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Vystar Corporation (&#8220;Vystar&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, or &#8220;our&#8221;) is the creator and exclusive owner of the innovative technology to produce Vytex&#174; Natural Rubber Latex (&#8220;NRL&#8221;). In addition, on September 13, 2012, we acquired SleepHealth, LLC and SleepHealth North Carolina, LLC (&#8220;SleepHealth&#8221;), privately-held sleep diagnostic companies headquartered in Monroe, Georgia. We effectively closed SleepHealth in January 2014 due to changes in the marketplace and an inability to add new accounts and secure Durable Medical Equipment (DME) business. In essence, since the acquisition, local hospitals have taken over several of our profitable locations, we were forced to close other locations due to a lack of payment for our services and our efforts to increase contract pricing with our remaining locations to a profitable level have failed. Vystar sold the few remaining SleepHealth assets and has been contemplating its next move to re-coup what it considers to be hidden fees, ineffective contract price expectations and outright fabrication of potential by the seller.

In addition, on June 28, 2013, Vystar Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) completed the acquisition of Kiron Clinical Sleep Lab, LLC (&#8220;Kiron&#8221;) a vertically integrated sleep diagnostic practice located in Durham, NC. As a result of these actions, Vystar Corporation is now comprised of two segments, a Vytex Division, focused on expanding the licensing and utilization of its proprietary source natural rubber latex technology, and a Kiron Division providing full sleep medicine services including clinical and diagnostic. Kiron has re-established its practice with sleep consultations, sleep studies, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (&#8220;CPAP&#8221;) titrations studies, focusing on its existing and growing physician referral and patient bases. Kiron sold the CPAP therapy resupply business and any remaining materials related to CPAP therapy resupply to the Sleepworks, LLC division of Medbridge Home Medical LLC on September 1, 2015.

The Vytex Division contains our global multi-patented technology that reduces antigenic and total protein in natural rubber latex products to virtually undetectable levels. Vytex NRL, our &#8220;ultra-low protein&#8221; natural rubber latex has been introduced throughout the worldwide marketplace that uses NRL or latex substitutes as a raw material for end products. Natural rubber latex or latex substitutes are used in an extensive range of products including balloons, textiles, footwear and clothing (threads), adhesives, foams (mattresses, pillows, mattress toppers, etc.), furniture (foam and adhesives), carpet, paints, coatings, protective equipment, sporting equipment, and, especially health care products such as condoms, surgical and exam gloves, among others. Our challenge has been that a manufacturer&#8217;s conversion from the use of standard latex or synthetic raw material to Vytex NRL involves a protracted sales cycle ranging from eighteen to thirty six months. Additionally, in the past, our primary method of distribution was via toll manufacturing. We now have several licensing agreements in place for global distribution that have allowed us to focus on and transition to sales and marketing with a technical oversight.

Products and Services 

Natural Rubber Latex 

Natural rubber latex is an agricultural product produced from the sap of the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. According to data obtained on the International Rubber Study Group web site (rubberstudy.com) and dated January 6, 2015: the world total rubber demand is forecast to increase at 1.8% and 4.1% in 2015 and 2016 respectively, growing below the long-term growth rate of 3.7% under the IMF Scenario to 29.1 million tonnes in 2015 and to 30.3 million tonnes in 2016.

World Natural Rubber (NR) demand is forecasted to increase by 3.1% in 2015 under the IMF Scenario and by 4.4% in 2016. The world total NR consumption is expected to be 12.3 million tonnes in 2015, 12.9 million tonnes in 2016 and increasing to 16.5 million tonnes in 2023. World Synthetic Rubber (SR) demand is expected to increase to 16.8 million tonnes in 2015 and rise to 17.5 million tonnes in 2016 under the IMF Scenario. In 2023, the demand for SR will be 21.5 million tonnes. The outlook for NR supply is positive, sufficient to meet the demand of the industry for all forecast years under all three scenarios. Almost 60% of global consumption is by the world&#8217;s tyre manufacturing industry, with the remainder going into the &#8216;general rubber products&#8217; sector; many thousands of different goods are manufactured by this sector, serving many industries, including transport, construction, health, mining etc.

Substantially all of the latex processors are located in Southeast Asia, India, Africa and Latin America and are owned by local groups or large multinational corporations. This future demand is awakening interest in other areas of the world where the climate is suitable, particularly in Guatemala, where it is expected the latex industry will grow from 57,000 tonnes produced in 2006 to over 95,000 tonnes by 2016, a 67% increase, according to a report issued by the office of Consulate General of Guatemala, Atlanta, Georgia in 2008. This is particularly attractive to U.S. manufacturers of latex products who could potentially see reduced transportation costs and lead times over the usual Asian sources. In addition to the resurgence of Central and South America in natural rubber latex production, countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia have launched major efforts to meet the needs of the global liquid natural rubber latex market.

Our initial product portfolio included Vytex NRL in high ammonia (HA) and low ammonia (LA) formulations. New specialized formulations are projected to come to market over the next year with ultra-low ammonia, pre-vulcanised and low nitrosamine versions currently being tested and/or developed. Vystar has used its technology to work with customers to solve production issues and provide them with a point of difference

Board of Directors Member and Research &#38; Development Director Ranjit K. Matthan, Ph.D., revealed ongoing developments in the formulation of Vytex NRL with reduced or no ammonia and nitrosamines at the International Latex Conference (ILC) session titled &#8220;Advances in Environmentally Friendly Ultra Low Protein Natural Rubber Specialty Latices&#8221; on August 12, 2015. The significant advances in aluminum hydroxide-treated Vytex NRL properties and applications are potential game-changers for the issues of volatile organic content and nitrosamines for some critical latex products, such as balloons, catheters , condoms, and other medical devices, as well as enabling cleaner and more sustainable work environments. The expanded Vystar product grades make it applicable in a wider range of latex products with the advantage of improved environmental impact through reduced leachables/extractables. The advances deliver a simplified, sustainable, totally safe raw material that Vystar can offer for several applications without reservations about nitrosamines. Production scale up of all three newer versions of Vytex NRL is currently being targeted as well as sample fulfillment. 

Vytex NRL is produced at the latex processor level and can be integrated into the current processing environments without additional capital equipment investment. The protein removal and modification process that leads to Vytex NRL allows manufacturers to lower manufacturing costs with the benefit of reduced protein levels. We presented a paper on this topic (&#8220;technical paper&#8221;) at the RAPRA Latex and Synthetic Polymer Dispersions 2010 Conference in Amsterdam in March 2010. Reduced leaching times and resulting reductions in energy, water and material handling consumption can lead to realized cost savings.

In January 2011, William Doyle, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, presented a paper entitled, &#8220;Eco-Friendly Manufacturing of High Performance Latex using Ultra Low Antigenic Protein Latex&#8221; at the India Rubber Expo (IRE 2011) in Chennai, India. This paper reviewed some of the learning&#8217;s Vystar had made since commercializing Vytex NRL. Among these discoveries were: improved air and helium retention in balloons; reduced leaching needs for some dipped products; truer colors for dyed dipped products; and low latex odor in foams. Later in the year, Vystar published and presented a paper, &#8220;Further Development of Vytex&#174; Natural Rubber Latex Leads to Strong Niche Market Advances&#8221;, at the July meeting of the International Latex Conference (ILC 2011) in Akron, Ohio. This paper added additional learnings related to slow release foam formulations and other technical improvements helping customers solve their new product development challenges.

We have transitioned from toll manufacturing agreements to licensing agreements. Licensing agreements eliminate the need to maintain a costly infrastructure along with the other investment and regulatory compliance costs to develop and operate a processing or manufacturing facility. All of these costs are or will be borne by our manufacturing and distribution contractors and/or customers. This means we must show the NRL producers and product manufacturers the economic value proposition of including Vytex NRL in their product lines, hence the technical paper presentations we have made and continue to make. In addition, as an all-natural raw material, Vytex NRL puts the main component in gloves and other products back in the environmentally friendly arena.

We have had a toll manufacturing agreement with Revertex (Malaysia), the world&#8217;s largest producer of pre-vulcanized natural rubber lattices, since 2008 that was renewed in 2011 and allowed to expire in 2013.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

To implement our licensing model, in March 2010 we signed a licensing agreement with Pica de Hule Natural, a division of Grupo Agroindustrial de Occidente (&#8220;Occidente&#8221;), located in Guatemala. Occidente is the largest processor of natural rubber latex in Latin America and the largest exporter serving more than 15 countries. Under the agreement, Occidente will manufacture, sell and market Vytex NRL throughout Latin America as well as supply Vytex NRL to North America and Europe through our existing Centrotrade Minerals &#38; Metals, US and Centrotrade Deutschland, GmbH, Germany distribution system.

In October 2010, we signed a second licensing agreement with KA Prevulcanized Latex (KAPVL) to manufacture and sell Vytex NRL in the SAARC region which includes India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. India is the second largest consumer of concentrated latex behind China. In 2014 this agreement ended and we did not renew.

In addition, in January 2009, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with Centrotrade Minerals &#38; Metals, US and Centrotrade Deutschland, GmbH, Germany, a leading global distributor of latex raw materials, to create a worldwide distribution network that will further enhance our ability to cost effectively reach and service manufacturer customers in these key manufacturing areas. This provides an expansive distribution network that facilitates both the licensing and toll manufacturing models and can assist with various processors in taking their products to market. On December 19, 2012, we amended our agreement with Centrotrade to expand Vytex NRL distribution rights to the world&#8217;s largest NRL consuming markets in Southeast Asia, specifically Malaysia and Thailand. Under this new license agreement, Centrotrade controls production scheduling of Vytex NRL, inventory, sales, pricing and customer financing, while Vystar will focus on marketing, customized product development, as noted above, and support activities.

In January 2013 William Doyle presented a paper entitled, &#8220;The Non Enzymatic Deproteinization of Natural Rubber Latex (DPNRL) Enabling the Greater Versatility in End Product Applications&#8221; at the India Rubber and Tyre Expo (IRE 2013) in Mumbai, India. This paper discussed improvements that extend beyond the ultra-low allergenicity of the DPNRL and include improved color, absence of rubber odor, and improved physicochemical attributes. Improved air and helium retentions results were reported. The potential to extend applications into other non-conventional areas other than latex end products was discussed. In July 2013, William Doyle presented an updated version of the IRE paper at the International Latex Conference in Akron, Ohio and in conjunction with its foam partner, Islatex, a division of Occidente; the Company began the development of a new line of bedding products. We are currently in the final test market stages for the United States based manufacturing of mattresses, pillows and toppers to key furniture stores and buying groups, primarily in the Northeastern United States and signed a 5 year renewable agreement in January 2015 with Nature&#8217;s Home Solutions (NHS) to exclusively distribute these products in the United States.

Recently, after two presentations to technical audiences and much publicity surrounding the foam line launch, Vystar has been approached by companies with novel ideas that include the use of its Vytex NRL raw material. Also Vystar has also completed trials with European and Indian makers of foam products to use its Vytex NRL raw material in their current offerings in their own areas as well as to supply added needs for foam cores in both the mattress and topper arenas. Vystar has also completed a trial to procure pillows made with Vytex NRL for global and domestic use with another trial planned for SE Asia. Vystar entered into discussions in July 2015 with a large international maker of natural rubber latex foam cores, who has an American subsidiary and distribution center to supply foam of varying thicknesses and firmness to handle global and domestic business for retail outlets and its online offerings. Vytex NRL completed the third trial phase at the American facility. A possible fourth trial will be contemplated at the end of the second quarter or beginning of the third quarter 2016. In addition, working with NHS and a large Vietnamese foam manufacturer, Lien A, the group attended the International Sleep Products Association (ISPA) in Orlando in March 2016. The significance of ISPA is the focus on components for use with major mattress and pillow manufacturers which takes Vytex foam to an additional audience.

Clinical Sleep Diagnostics and Durable Medical Equipment 

Kiron entered into an Independent Contractor Agreement with Henry Clifford Baggett, MD, a North Carolina physician and sleep specialist, to assume the role of Medical Director for Kiron on July 21, 2014. Dr. Baggett was born in Reidsville, NC and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and graduated in 1966. He then attended UNC Medical School and graduated in 1970. After residency at the Philadelphia Naval Hospital and board certification in Otolaryngology (Ear Nose and Throat-Head and Neck Surgery) in 1975, he returned to NC and served two more years in the Navy at Camp Lejeune.

Dr. Baggett established a practice in Rocky Mount, NC, and practiced there until 2004 when he moved to Raleigh. He became interested in Sleep Medicine in 2001 and established a sleep lab company for diagnostic sleep studies. Although he no longer has that company, his practice has been exclusively Sleep Medicine since 2004. He became board certified in Sleep Medicine in 2008. Recently Dr. Baggett expressed his desire to end the Independent Contractor Agreement effective mid-April 2016 and suggested another physician as medical director. The Vystar Board of Directors will consider future plans for Kiron at its next meeting.

Kiron sold the CPAP therapy resupply business and any remaining materials related to CPAP therapy resupply to the Sleepworks, LLC division of Medbridge Home Medical LLC on September 1, 2015.

Competition 

&#160; Natural Rubber Latex 

Synthetic raw materials such as ethylene, propylene, styrene and butadiene compete with NRL. Currently, it is estimated that NRL processors have lost one-half of the overall latex market to synthetic latex. Despite the switch to non-latex alternatives, it is estimated that in U.S. hospitals as recently as September, 2010 over 70% of exam gloves and nearly 80% of surgical gloves were still made with NRL.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Several attempts, including new source crops, synthetic lattices and various treatment methods, have been made to eliminate problem proteins from Hevea NRL by biological, physical and/or chemical methods that act on proteins. One approach has been to introduce the latex articles to multiple leaching steps and chlorination. While it does reduce the protein levels in the finished product, it weakens the latex film thus compromising the desirable physical properties of the product. Another attempt to reduce proteins in NRL is the use of proteolytic enzymes to degrade the proteins in the latex solution but this approach introduces another protein (the enzyme) to the latex, which may itself be allergenic. Attempts to commercialize two other non-Hevea NRL materials have been made in the United States: guayule rubber latex and Taraxacum kok-saghyz, also known as the Russian dandelion. These materials are reported to be higher in cost compared to natural rubber latex and presently are available only in limited quantities.

These facts, coupled with the uncomplicated transition to the utilization of Vytex NRL, make it very attractive for processors to regain lost business by switching to Vytex NRL. We believe our unique patented technology offers a viable alternative to the marketplace. The licensing model will allow the message to spread through more sales channels than we could reach in the past.

Clinical Sleep Diagnostics and Durable Medical Equipment 

We compete against numerous sleep-diagnostic providers, from smaller physicians&#8217; offices to larger healthcare providers, including clinics and hospitals. While the competition is intense, we believe we have good relationships with our referring physicians and patient-base. Since sleep studies are performed overnight, the practice gains another revenue stream in off hours. Sleep-related problems are a public health crisis, with an estimated 50 to 70 million Americans experiencing sleep disorders.

Intellectual Property 

Vystar has four issued patents by the United States Patent Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) that were issued in 2005 (Patent No. 6,906,126), 2006 (Patent No. 7,056,970), 2011 (Patent No. 8,048,951) and 2012 (Patent No. 8,324,312). International patents include one issued patent from the Republic of South Africa in 2009 (2008/00886), a second foreign patent issued by China in 2011 (No. 200580051526.1), a third foreign patent issued by Japan in 2012 (No. 4944885) and a fourth foreign patent issued by Hong Kong in 2013 (HK1125959). In 2005, we sought international patent protection of our application that would become our U.S. Patent No. 6,906,126 pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT&#8221;) (No. PCT/US2005/025018), and this application has been nationalized in the following countries and regions: The European Union (No.05775523.3), Canada (No. 2,614,945), India (No.295/DELNP/2008), and Sri Lanka (No.14827). Additionally, this PCT was nationalized back into the United States to expand our protection to both method and composition claims (No.11/988,498). We expect patents to be issued in these countries without objection.

On January 18, 2012, we converted the provisional patent filed January 18, 2011 (No. 61/433,853) to full utility applications based on new discoveries and unexpected results (No. 13/374,851). We also sought international protection for the new developments and unexpected results reflected in this 2009 USPTO patent application through another PCT application (No. PCT/US2009/031445). This PCT application was nationalized in the following countries in 2010: the European Union (No. 09702339.4), Brazil (No. PI0906513-0), Guatemala (No. 2010-000208), India (No.2487/KOLNP/2010), Indonesia (No. W-00201002436), and Malaysia (No. PI2010003317). In addition, we filed the same patent application that was the subject of our USPTO patent application No. 12/356,355 and PCT/US2009/031445 directly into Thailand (No. 0901000201). Thailand has informed us that our patent application is now published for open comments.

The European Patent Office issued a Decision to Grant Vystar&#8217;s patent application under European Patent Number 1 902 089 titled &#8220;Decreasing Allergenicity of Natural Latex Rubber Prior to Vulcanization&#8221; greatly expanding the territory covered by the Company&#8217;s intellectual property portfolio. The mention of the grant was published in the European Patent Bulletin 13/35 dated 28 August 2013. Vystar selected the United Kingdom (065143-011612/UK), Germany (065143-011611/DE), and Austria (065143-001610/AT) as validation points for this specific patent. Also, on September 14, 2014, we were notified by the Patents Office of Ireland that Patent 1902089 covering the same above titled patent was awarded to the Company on August 28, 2013.

Vystar filed and has received registered trademark protected status in the United States for the marks &#8220;Vystar&#8221;, &#8220;Vytex&#8221; and &#8220;Created by Nature. Recreated by Science.&#8221; In 2010 Vystar filed for international trademark protection of &#8220;Vytex&#8221; in Malaysia (No.2010013149) and India (No. 1992991), which was granted in India. On November 18, 2014, the Company was informed that the &#8220;VYTEX&#8221; trademark was registered in Malaysia effective May 30, 2014. The aforementioned marks have been renewed successfully in each period as required.

While we believe that the pending patent and trademark applications will be granted without objection, there are no guarantees that all such patents or trademarks will be granted by each relevant governing body. No assurance can be given that such patent and trademark protection will provide substantial protection from competition. We realize that the market for Vytex NRL is an industrialized world concern and we are committed to aggressively challenging any infringements of our patents and/or trademarks. As of December 31, 2015, Vystar has expended, since inception, approximately $260,000 on such patent and trademark costs and has budgeted approximately $10,000 more for the year ended December 31, 2016 to continue to pursue and maintain its patents and trademarks around the world.

&#160; 

&#160;

Research and Development 

Vytex NRL has produced protein test results on finished products that are both &#8220;below detection&#8221; and &#8220;not detectable&#8221; in terms of the amount of proteins remaining in these finished goods made with Vytex NRL. These results have been reproduced in many subsequent tests. From inception through December 31, 2015, Vystar&#8217;s research and development costs have been approximately $2.4 million. These efforts past and future have been and will continue to be patented and/or trademarked.

Government Regulation 

Vytex:

In the United States, healthcare and many food and food-based packaging products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Vystar is not directly subject to regulation by the FDA due to the fact that it does not manufacture a finished medical device or other product, but only provides Vytex NRL as a component or raw material to healthcare or other product manufacturers. However, there will be FDA regulation of the labeling of healthcare and food-based packaging products that are produced with Vytex NRL and the FDA has promulgated standards for good manufacturing practices for manufacturing the end products, which makes the end product manufacturers responsible for seeing that all of their components and component manufacturers, including Vytex NRL, are produced using good manufacturing processes. Additionally, the FDA prohibits the use of the term &#8220;hypoallergenic&#8221; or &#8220;low protein&#8221; on any natural rubber latex product it regulates. In order to make any such claim, the latex product manufacturer must seek a waiver from the FDA of such regulatory prohibitions. Commentary by the FDA in its guidance documents and other rulings indicate that the prohibition on the use of the &#8220;hypoallergenic&#8221; or &#8220;low protein&#8221; label is based, at least in part, on the fact that, although the use of such terms in such labeling may be intended to indicate that the risk of allergic reaction to residual levels of processing chemicals has been reduced, consumers may interpret the labeling to mean that the risk of allergic reactions to any component in the device would be minimal. Thus the hypoallergenic or low protein label is deemed misleading. There can be no assurance, however, that we will succeed in securing FDA approval for any claim regarding the &#8220;hypoallergenic&#8221; &#8220;low protein&#8221; or reduced allergy potential of latex produced with the Vytex NRL process. Failure to secure, if required, such FDA approval, could delay or otherwise detrimentally affect our introduction to natural rubber latex healthcare and/or food packaging products regulated by the FDA. Notwithstanding, the medical or food packaging manufacturer will be able to use the Vytex NRL trademark on its label if size permits to indicate only that the Vytex NRL component was used in the production of the healthcare product, and what protein levels the end product does contain, but no further claim is asserted. We have been able to provide sufficient testing data to the FDA to support our protein level claims with respect to the natural rubber latex antigenic and total proteins present in end products made with Vytex NRL.

On May 1, 2009, a condom manufactured from Vytex NRL received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This was the first medical product available in the U.S. made from Vytex NRL, which had less than 2 micrograms/dm2, virtually undetectable levels, of the antigenic proteins that cause an allergic response, while retaining and improving upon all of the desirable qualities of latex. While the product is no longer available, this condom is a predicate device for future products and the 510(k) is still in existence. Vystar continues to seek other U.S. manufacturers interested in pursuing similar claims for products.

On July 22, 2009, an un-powdered medical exam glove manufactured with Vytex NRL received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, with an approved claim of less than 50 micrograms/gram of total proteins. As with the condom product, Vystar continues to pursue U.S. manufacturers using this exam glove as a predicate device.

Clinical Sleep Diagnostics and Durable Medical Equipment:

Our business is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;) Act, the Affordable Care Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act relating to, among other things, licensure, conduct of operations, privacy of patient information, physician relationships, addition of facilities and services, reimbursement rates for services, and consumer debt collections.

The laws, rules and regulations governing the health care industry are extremely complex and, in certain areas, the industry has little or no regulatory or judicial interpretation for guidance. If a determination is made that we were in violation of such laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to penalties or liabilities or required to make significant changes to our operations.

Inflation and Seasonality 

We do not believe that our operations are significantly impacted by inflation. Our NRL business is not seasonal in nature, but is subject to commodity pricing. Our NRL product is a commodity-based raw material and prices for such material fluctuate from day-to-day, though this will have less impact as we transition to sales via licensing fees.

The sleep diagnostic business shows a decrease in revenue in the fourth quarter, particularly in November and December, due to holiday commitments making patients reluctant to schedule tests as compared to other times of the year.
