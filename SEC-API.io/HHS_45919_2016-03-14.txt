 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

INTRODUCTION 

Harte Hanks, Inc. (Harte Hanks) partners with clients to deliver relevant, connected, and quality customer interactions. Our approach starts with discovery and learning, which leads to customer journey mapping, creative and content development, analytics, and data management, and ends with execution and support in a variety of digital and traditional channels. We produce engaging and memorable customer interactions to drive business results for our clients, develop better customer relationships, experiences, and defining interaction-led marketing. 

Virtually all organizations rely on marketing to generate revenues and publicity. Many businesses have a chief-level executive responsible for marketing who is charged with combining data, technology, channels, and resources to demonstrate a return on marketing investment. This has led many businesses to use direct and targeted marketing, which offer accountability and measurability of marketing programs, allowing customer insight to be leveraged to create and accelerate value. Harte Hanks is a leader in highly targeted, multichannel marketing. 

We are the successor to a newspaper business started by Houston Harte and Bernard Hanks in Texas in the early 1920s. In 1972, Harte Hanks went public and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We became private in a leveraged buyout in 1984, and in 1993 we again went public and listed our common stock on the NYSE. 

We provide public access to all reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act). These documents may be accessed free of charge on our website at www.HarteHanks.com . These documents are provided as soon as practical after they are filed with the SEC and may also be found at the SEC&#8217;s website at www.sec.gov . Additionally, we have adopted and posted on our website a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. Our website also includes our corporate governance guidelines and the charters for each of our audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees. We will provide a printed copy of any of the aforementioned documents to any requesting stockholder. 

OUR BUSINESS 

&#160; 

During 2014, we initiated a new strategy and revised our operational structure to suit that new strategy by organizing into two distinct operating divisions: Customer Interaction and Trillium Software. In accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting, &#32;we determined that under this new organizational structure, we will report the two operating divisions as two reportable segments &#8212; Customer Interaction and Trillium Software. Our reportable segments are described below. 

&#160; 

Customer Interaction 

Our Customer Interaction services offer a wide variety of integrated, multi-channel, data-driven solutions for top brands around the globe. We help our clients gain insight into their customers&#8217; behaviors from their data and use that insight to create innovative multi-channel marketing programs to deliver a return on marketing investment. We believe our clients&#8217; success is determined not only by how good their tools are, but how well we help them use the tools to gain insight and analyze their consumers. This results in a strong and enduring relationship between our clients and their customers which is key to being leaders in Customer Interaction. We offer a full complement of capabilities and resources to provide a broad range of marketing services, in media from direct mail to email, including: 

&#8226; 

Agency &#38; Digital Services. Our agency services are full-service, customer engagement agencies specializing in direct and digital communications for both consumer and business-to-business markets. With strategy, creative, and implementation services, we help marketers within targeted industries understand, identify, and engage prospects and customers in their channel of choice. Our digital solutions integrate online services within the marketing mix and include: search engine management, display, digital analytics, website development and design, digital strategy, social media, email, e-commerce, and interactive relationship management and a host of other services that support our core businesses. 

&#8226; 

Database Marketing Solutions and Business-to-Business Lead Generation. We have successfully delivered marketing database solutions across various industries. Our solutions are built around centralized marketing databases with three core offerings: insight and analytics; customer data integration; and marketing communications tools. Our solutions enable organizations to build and manage customer communication strategies that drive new customer acquisition and retention and maximize the value of existing customer relationships. Through insight, we help clients identify models of their most profitable customer relationships and then apply these models to increase the value of existing customers while also winning profitable new customers. Through customer data integration, data from multiple sources comes together to provide a single customer view of client prospects and customers. Then we help clients apply their data and insights to the entire customer life cycle, to help clients sustain and grow their business, gain deeper customer insights, and continuously refine their customer resource management strategies and tactics. 

&#8226; 

Direct Mail. &#32;As a full-service direct marketing provider and one of the largest mailing partners of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), our operational mandate is to ensure creativity and quality, provide an understanding of the options available in technologies and segmentation strategies and capitalize on economies of scale with our variety of execution options. Our services include: digital printing, print on demand, advanced mail optimization, logistics and transportation optimization, tracking (including our proprietary prEtrak solution), commingling, shrink wrapping, and specialized mailings. We also maintain fulfillment centers where we provide custom kitting services, print on demand, product recalls, and freight optimization allowing our customers to distribute literature and other marketing materials. 

&#8226; 

Contact Centers. &#32;We operate teleservice workstations around the globe providing advanced contact center solutions such as: speech, voice and video chat, integrated voice response, analytics, social cloud monitoring, and web self-service. We provide both inbound and outbound contact center services and support many languages with our strategically placed global locations for both consumer and business-to-business markets. 

&#160; 

Many of our client relationships start with an offering from the list above on an individual solution basis or a combination of our offerings from across our portfolio of businesses. 

&#160; 

Trillium Software 

Trillium Software is a leading global enterprise data quality solutions provider. Our data quality specialists help organizations achieve increased business from their data management initiatives and existing business-critical processes by providing enterprise data profiling and data cleansing software and services. We offer industry-specific business solutions that help solve data problems experienced by financial services, banking, retail, healthcare, manufacturing, and risk professionals. Our full complement of technologies and services includes global data profiling, data cleansing, enrichment, and data linking for e-business, Big Data customer relationship management, data governance, enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, data warehouse, and other enterprise applications. Revenues from the Trillium Software segment are comprised primarily of perpetual software licenses, annual maintenance and professional services. 

&#160; 

In 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , Harte Hanks had revenues from continuing operations of $495.3 million , $553.7 million , and $559.6 million , respectively. Customer Interaction had revenues from continuing operations of $444.2 million , $499.4 million , and $503.8 million , respectively. Trillium Software had revenues from continuing operations of $51.1 million , $54.2 million , and $55.8 million , respectively. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Our services are marketed to specific industries or markets with services and software products tailored to each industry or market. We believe that we are generally able to provide services to new industries and markets by modifying our existing services and applications. We currently provide services primarily to the retail, technology, financial services, automotive and consumer brands, and pharmaceutical/healthcare vertical markets, in addition to a range of select markets. The largest client (measured in revenue) comprised 6% &#32;of total revenues in 2015 . The largest 25 clients in terms of revenue comprised 57% &#32;of total revenues in 2015 . 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Our Customer Interaction enterprise sales force sells a variety of solutions and services to address client&#8217;s targeted marketing needs. We maintain solution-specific sales forces and sales groups to sell our individual products and solutions. Our direct sales forces, with industry-specific knowledge and experience, emphasize the cross-selling of a full range of Customer Interaction direct marketing services and are supported by employees in each sector assigned to specific clients with industry specific expertise. We rely on our enterprise and solution sellers to primarily sell our products and services to new clients and task our employees supporting existing clients to expand our client relationship through additional solutions and products. 

&#160; 

Trillium Software is marketed and sold world-wide through direct, reseller, and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) channels. Our primary sales channel is our direct sales force in North America, Europe, and Australia. Resellers covering over 40 countries serve to provide even wider coverage where we lack a direct sales presence. The Trillium Software System can also be obtained through a network of OEMs and integration partners. Our product is also available directly from our website in a cloud deployment method.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our business faces significant competition in all of its offerings and within each of its vertical markets. Direct marketing is a dynamic business, subject to rapid technological change, high turnover of client personnel who make buying decisions, client consolidations, changing client needs and preferences, continual development of competing products and services, and an evolving competitive landscape. Our competition comes from numerous local, national, and international direct marketing and advertising companies, and client internal resources, against whom we compete for individual projects, entire client relationships, and marketing expenditures. Competitive factors in our industry include the quality and scope of services, technical and strategic expertise, the perceived value of the services provided, reputation, and brand recognition. We also compete against print and electronic media and other forms of advertising for marketing and advertising dollars in general. Failure to continually improve our current processes, advance and upgrade our technology applications, and to develop new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, could result in the loss of our clients or prospective clients to current or future competitors. In addition, failure to gain market acceptance of new products and services could adversely affect our growth. Although we believe that our capabilities and breadth of services, combined with our U.S and international production capability, industry focus, and ability to offer a broad range of integrated services, enable us to compete effectively, our business results may be adversely impacted by competition. Please refer to Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;, for additional information regarding risks related to competition. 

&#160; 

Trillium Software likewise faces widely varied competitors, but the most frequent competition is a potential client&#8217;s own information technology staff, who may design and produce customized information quality solutions rather than seeking more robust, specialized, or scalable capabilities or software. Trillium Software also competes against large market makers (such as IBM, Oracle, and SAP) whose product offering are greater in breadth, if less capable in information quality alone. We also compete against about 40 niche providers of information quality software and services, whose sales focus is usually geared toward narrower markets. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our revenues tend to be higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters during a given year. This increased revenue is a result of overall increased marketing activity prior to and during the holiday season, primarily related to our retail vertical. 

&#160; 

Discontinued Operations 

&#160; 

Previously, Harte Hanks also provided shopper advertising opportunities through our Shoppers segment, which operated in certain California markets. On September 27, 2013 we sold the assets of our California Shoppers operations, The Pennysaver, for gross proceeds of $22.5 million. This transaction resulted in an after-tax loss of $12.4 million. Because Shoppers represented a distinct business unit with operations and cash flows that can clearly be distinguished, both operationally and for financial purposes, from the rest of Harte Hanks, the results of the Shoppers operations are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Results of the remaining Harte Hanks business are reported as continuing operations. After this sale, Harte Hanks no longer has any Shoppers operations or circulation. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

As a company conducting varied business activities for clients across diverse industries around the world, we are subject to a variety of domestic and international legal and regulatory requirements that impact our business, including, for example, regulations governing consumer protection, and unfair business practices, contracts, e-commerce, intellectual property, labor, and employment (especially wage and hour laws), securities, tax, and other laws that are generally applicable to commercial activities. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to, or affected by, numerous local, national, and international laws, regulations, and industry standards that regulate direct marketing activities, including those that address privacy, data security, and unsolicited marketing communications. Examples of some of these laws and regulations that may be applied to, or affect, our business or the businesses of our clients include the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Federal and state laws governing the use of the internet and regulating telemarketing, including the U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM), which regulates commercial email and requires that commercial emails give recipients an opt-out method. Canada&#8217;s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) applies in a comparable manner for our activities in Canada. Telemarketing activities are regulated by, among other requirements, the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR), the Federal Communications Commission&#8217;s Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), and various state do-not-call laws. 

&#8226; 

Federal and state laws governing the collection and use of personal data online and via mobile devices, including but not limited to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which seek to address consumer privacy and protection. 

&#8226; 

The U.S. Department of Commerce&#8217;s proposed Privacy Shield Framework, the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change policy, and the European Commission&#8217;s newly announced European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), each of which seeks to address consumer privacy, data protection, and technological advancements in relation to the collection or use of personal information. 

&#8226; 

A significant number of states in the U.S. have passed versions of data security or breach notification laws, which include required standards for data security and generally require timely notifications to affected persons in the event of data security breaches or other unauthorized access to certain types of protected personal data. With the increased attention security breaches have received, federal legislation may also be adopted and impose additional obligations. 

&#8226; 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which governs, among other things, the sharing of consumer report information, access to credit scores, and requirements for users of consumer report information. 

&#8226; 

The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB), which, among other things, regulates the use for marketing purposes of non-public personal financial information of consumers that is held by financial institutions. Although Harte Hanks is not considered a financial institution, many of our clients are subject to the GLB. The GLB also includes rules relating to the physical, administrative, and technological protection of non-public personal financial information. 

&#8226; 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which regulates the use of protected health information for marketing purposes and requires reasonable safeguards designed to prevent intentional or unintentional use or disclosure of protected health information. 

&#8226; 

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which amended the FCRA and requires, among other things, consumer credit report notice requirements for creditors that use consumer credit report information in connection with risk-based credit pricing actions and also prohibits a business that receives consumer information from an affiliate from using that information for marketing purposes unless the consumer is first provided a notice and an opportunity to direct the business not to use the information for such marketing purposes, subject to certain exceptions. 

&#8226; 

The European Union (EU) data protection laws, including the comprehensive EU Directive on Data Protection (1995) (EU Directive), and the GDPR (which will replace the EU Directive once implemented), which imposes a number of obligations with respect to use of personal data, and includes a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the EU to other countries that do not provide consumers with an &#8220;adequate&#8221; level of privacy or security. The EU standard for adequacy is generally stricter and more comprehensive than that of the U.S. and most other countries. 

There are additional consumer protection, privacy and data security regulations in locations where we or our clients do business. These laws regulate the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of personal data and may require consent from consumers and grant consumers other rights, such as the ability to access their personal data and to correct information in the possession of data controllers. We and many of our clients also belong to trade associations that impose guidelines that regulate direct marketing activities, such as the Direct Marketing Association&#8217;s Commitment to Consumer Choice. 

&#160; 

As a result of increasing public awareness and interest in individual privacy rights, data protection, information security, and environmental and other concerns regarding marketing communications, federal, state, and foreign governmental and industry organizations continue to consider new legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose additional restrictions on direct marketing services and products. Examples include data encryption standards, data breach notification requirements, consumer choice and consent restrictions, and increased penalties against offending parties, among others. In 2012 and 2013, several members of the U.S. Congress (in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission and consumer advocacy groups) initiated several inquiries regarding data brokerage, one of which was directed to us (among others). We anticipate that further inquiries and legislative proposals will be made which may affect the services we offer our clients. 

&#160; 

In addition, our business may be affected by the impact of these restrictions on our clients and their marketing activities. These additional regulations could increase compliance requirements and restrict or prevent the collection, management, aggregation, transfer, use, or dissemination of information or data that is currently legally available. Additional regulations may also restrict or prevent current practices regarding unsolicited marketing communications. For example, many states have considered implementing do-not-mail legislation that could impact our business and the businesses of our clients and customers. In addition, continued public interest in individual privacy rights and data security may result in the adoption of further voluntary industry guidelines that could impact our direct marketing activities and business practices. 

&#160; 

We cannot predict the scope of any new legislation, regulations, or industry guidelines or how courts may interpret existing and new laws. Additionally, enforcement priorities by governmental authorities may change and also impact our business either directly or through requiring our customers to alter their practices. Compliance with regulations is costly and time-consuming for us and our clients, and we may encounter difficulties, delays, or significant expenses in connection with our compliance. We may also be exposed to significant penalties, liabilities, reputational harm, and loss of business in the event that we fail to comply with applicable regulations. There could be a material adverse impact on our business due to the enactment or enforcement of legislation or industry regulations, the issuance of judicial or governmental interpretations, enforcement priorities of governmental agencies, or a change in customs arising from public concern over consumer privacy and data security issues. 

&#160; 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 

&#160; 

Our intellectual property assets include trademarks and service marks that identify our company and our products and services, know-how, software, and other technology that we develop for our internal use and for license to clients and data and intellectual property licensed from third parties, such as commercial software and data providers. We generally seek to protect our intellectual property through a combination of license agreements and trademark, service mark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws, and domain name registrations and enforcement procedures. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with many of our employees, vendors, and clients and seek to limit access to and distribution of intellectual property and other proprietary information. We pursue the protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property in the U.S. and internationally. 

&#160; 

Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information and technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, and unauthorized use of our intellectual property may occur. We cannot be certain that patents or trademark registrations will be issued, nor can we be certain that any issued patents or trademark registrations will give us adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged and declared invalid or unenforceable. In addition, others may develop competing technologies or databases on their own. Moreover, there is no assurance that our confidentiality agreements with our employees or third parties will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information. 

&#160; 

We may also be subject to infringement claims against us by third parties and may incur substantial costs and devote significant management resources in responding to such claims, as we did in 2013. We have been, and continue to be, obligated under some agreements to indemnify our clients as a result of claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. These costs and distractions could cause our business to suffer. If any party asserts an infringement claim, we may need to obtain licenses to the disputed intellectual property. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or that we will be able to obtain any licenses at all. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights may have an adverse affect on our ability to provide our products and services. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , Harte Hanks employed 5,529 &#32;full-time employees and 44 &#32;part-time employees, of which approximately 2,333 &#32;are based outside of the U.S., primarily in the Philippines. A portion of our workforce is provided to us through staffing companies. None of the workforce is represented by labor unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
