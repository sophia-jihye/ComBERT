 I TEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

INTRODUCTION

Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;UVE,&#8221; and together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;the company&#8221;) is the largest private personal residential homeowners insurance company in Florida by direct written premium in-force, with a 9.0% market share as of September 30, 2015, according to the most recent data reported by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the &#8220;FLOIR&#8221;). We perform substantially all aspects of insurance underwriting, policy issuance, general administration and claims processing and settlement internally. We currently write personal residential homeowners insurance policies, predominantly in Florida with $817.7 million in direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2015. We also write homeowners insurance policies in Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina, with $65.7 million in direct written premium in those states for the year ended December 31, 2015. We are also licensed to issue policies in Alabama, Michigan, New Hampshire, Virginia and West Virginia. Our business outside of Florida represents approximately 16% of our total insured value, or $24,271 million, as of December 31, 2015. 

Over the past several years, we have grown our business both within Florida and elsewhere in the United States through our distribution network of approximately 7,800 licensed independent agents. In writing business, we adhere to a disciplined underwriting approach &#8211; writing risks that are priced adequately and meet our underwriting standards &#8211; designed to achieve profitable growth as opposed to merely increasing the total number of policies written. We believe we are better positioned and able to expand profitably and service our policyholders within our markets than many of our competitors due to our established internal capabilities; protection afforded us by our reinsurance program; our experienced management team that successfully navigated prior active hurricane seasons, such as 2004 and 2005; our strong surplus and capital base; our success in growing organically in Florida without relying on the assumption of blocks of policies from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;), the Florida state-sponsored insurer of last resort; and our growing geographic diversification. We also believe that our reinsurance program is structured such that if we were to experience an active hurricane season like the hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005, we would be able to pay policyholder claims, maintain sufficient surplus to grow profitably and take advantage of the resulting market dislocation that would likely follow. We believe that our longevity in the Florida market and our resulting depth of experience will enable us to continue to successfully grow our business in both hard markets (periods of capital shortages resulting in a lack of insurance availability, relatively low levels of price competition, more selective underwriting of risks and relatively high premium rates) and soft markets (periods of relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and generally low premium rates). 

&#160;

Below is an organization chart that summarizes our corporate structure : 

Universal Property &#38; Casualty Insurance Company (&#8220;UPCIC&#8221;) and American Platinum Property and Casualty Insurance Company (&#8220;APPCIC,&#8221; and together with UPCIC, the &#8220;Insurance Entities&#8221;) are our insurance operating subsidiaries. Most of our policies are written by UPCIC. Universal Risk Advisors (&#8220;URA&#8221;) is our managing general agent and manages our distribution network and negotiates our reinsurance. Universal Inspection Corporation conducts inspections as part of our underwriting process, and Universal Adjusting Corporation (&#8220;UAC&#8221;) manages our claims processing and adjustment functions. Blue Atlantic Reinsurance Corporation (&#8220;BARC&#8221;) is our reinsurance intermediary. These service companies are vertically aligned with our Insurance Entities to maintain quality throughout the policy origination and claim settlement process. In addition, our servicing subsidiaries reduce, to us, the costs typically associated with outsourced business functions, enhance our ability to expand geographically due to economies of scale in our operations and allow us to expand our business incrementally and more effectively.

OUR STRATEGY

Increase our Policies in-Force in Florida through Continued Profitable and Organic Growth

We intend to continue profitably growing our business organically in Florida through our established network of approximately 4,500 independent Florida agents, the top 20% of whom originated approximately 70% of our direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2015, and approximately 1,000 of whom have written business with our company for over a decade. Many of our competitors have experienced growth in recent years primarily as a result of assuming policies from Citizens. Because we perform all of our own marketing and underwriting as part of our organic growth strategy, we believe that we are more deliberate in seeking out profitable business from our independent agent force and selective in the policies we write as compared to Citizens, which generally must provide coverage to policyholders who have been unable to obtain insurance elsewhere. We have not assumed any policies from Citizens or its predecessor, Florida Residential Property and Casualty Joint Underwriting Association, since a single, small transaction in 1998, and have no plans to do so in the future. By contrast, in some cases, our competitors received approval to assume as many as 55,000 to 173,000 policies from Citizens in a single year. As of September 30, 2015, Citizens had approximately 570,000 policies outstanding (down from a peak level of approximately 1.5 million policies in late 2011) . We believe that our continuing commitment to organic growth and to servicing our policyholders has created not only a superior premium base but also positive, long-term relationships with our independent agents and policyholders, which will foster our continued growth in and outside of Florida. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we issued 133,782 new policies, compared to 171,989 new policies issued by Citizens and 683,380 new policies (in each case, excluding mobile homeowners and farmowners) issued by the remaining top 25 personal and commercial residential homeowners insurers in Florida combined during the same period, according to the most recent data published by the FLOIR.

&#160;

Increase our Policies in-Force Outside of Florida to Grow Profitably and Diversify Revenue and Risk 

We intend to continue our expansion outside of Florida primarily to take advantage of opportunities to write profitable business as well as to diversify our revenue and risk. We are targeting states with underserved homeowners insurance markets where we believe there is price adequacy for our products and where policyholders would benefit from our market knowledge and integrated service model. In new markets, we seek to replicate the successful growth strategy we implemented in Florida, including the careful appointment of new agents that we believe will generate profitable business for our company. We intend to leverage our existing agent network to generate new relationships and business. We will continue in our commitment to careful, profitable business growth through such independent agents, with the intent to grow quickly when the opportunity arises, including following any market dislocation. Our strategy involves taking the time to learn about each new market and its unique risks in order to carefully develop our own policy forms, rates and informed underwriting standards. 

We also believe further geographic diversification will decrease our relative reinsurance costs as our risk profile changes to include more risks not tied to the Florida hurricane season. We believe that such diversification will produce more earnings stability as we expand to states with different market cycles than Florida and where the risks insured could offset Florida losses during an active hurricane season. We write homeowners policies in Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina, and are also licensed to issue policies in Alabama, Michigan, New Hampshire, Virginia and West Virginia. As of December 31, 2015, policies outside of Florida accounted for 16% of our total insured value, or $24,271 million, an increase from 12.1% as of December 31, 2014. 

Optimize our Reinsurance Program as our Risk Profile Changes

We will continue to obtain what we believe to be appropriate reinsurance limits, coverage and terms so that our policyholders and shareholders are adequately protected in the event of an active hurricane season. Significant additional, new capital entering portions of the reinsurance marketplace has provided us with the opportunity to obtain favorable pricing and contract terms. Our dedicated reinsurance team at BARC includes seasoned industry professionals with an average of 24 years of experience, whom we hired from Willis Re almost 10 years ago. BARC differentiates us from our competitors by enabling us to act as our own reinsurance intermediary, developing a bespoke reinsurance program tailored to our needs in both soft and hard reinsurance markets. This team has developed and enhanced existing strong long term relationships with world leading reinsurance companies it brought to the company 10 years ago providing better efficiency in the manner in which we buy reinsurance annually. We had in excess of 40 reinsurance partners for the 2015-2016 reinsurance year from companies in the United States, Bermuda, London, Continental Europe and Asia. BARC works in conjunction with URA in providing these services. We also receive reinsurance intermediary services from Aon Benfield and thereby benefit from its depth of experience and knowledge of market standards. Aon Benfield works closely with our teams at BARC and URA in designing our reinsurance program and allowing us to obtain favorable pricing. Our internal team and Aon Benfield continually evaluate prevailing costs and the level of coverage that we determine is necessary in order to proactively capitalize on favorable market conditions. 

We eliminated our quota share reinsurance arrangements effective June 1, 2015; purchased additional excess of loss catastrophe cover; and converted from a two-tower reinsurance program to a single tower reinsurance program covering our nationwide business based on our improving financial condition, our evaluation of market conditions and our changing coverage needs. We believe that restructuring our reinsurance program in this manner and continuously re-evaluating that structure has allowed us to take advantage of attractive reinsurance pricing and terms and to retain profitable business by eliminating our quota share program, while still maintaining reinsurance coverage that we believe is sufficient to protect our policyholders and shareholders. 

Continue to Provide High Quality Service through our Vertically Integrated Structure

We are committed to proactively managing our losses, loss adjustment expenses (&#8220;LAE&#8221;) and claims administration procedures through prudent underwriting and the use of internal claims adjustment services. On March 5, 2015, we acquired Aplin Peer &#38; Associates Inc., an independent claims adjusting firm, to supplement our already sizable claims function, increasing our claims adjusting staff from 121 employees to 175 employees as of January 20, 2016. In recent years, we have significantly expedited our claims processing, including creating a mobile adjuster force that can visit a policyholder within days to settle a claim. In 2015, our average time to close claims decreased by over a week as compared to 2013 and 2014. In addition, despite an increase of 12.3% in our policies in-force in 2015, we have reduced our claims operating expenses by 2.3% as compared to 2014. We have also decreased our average LAE in excess of $300 per claim file since 2014. Our expedited claims processing improves the policyholder experience and, therefore, our relationship with that policyholder&#8217;s agent, which we believe increases the persistency of our policies in-force. Our monthly weighted average policy renewal retention rate has increased from 83.2% in 2013, to 86.8% in 2014 and 88.1% in 2015. 

In the future, we will continue to capitalize on our vertically integrated structure by retaining certain fees that we pay to our subsidiary service providers for reinsurance brokerage, adjusting and other services. We currently administer 100% of all claims and outsource 

&#160;

40% of on-site field adjustment assignments, and thereby retain a corresponding portion of fees that would have otherwise been paid to external adjusters. These cost efficiencies will help us better withstand the financial impact of potential catastrophic storms. We also continue to retain select third-party claims adjusters to perform field services for and adjust the remaining portion of our claims in order to maintain our relationships with them, so they can assist us, during periods of hig h claims volume, in providing high quality and timely service to our policyholders. Accordingly, we believe we are able to reduce expenses during non-catastrophe years while providing a high level of customer service during all years. 

OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

We believe that our success, historical growth and ability to capitalize on our future growth prospects are a result of the following competitive strengths of our business and management team.

Experienced Leadership Team with a Long History in the Florida Personal Residential Insurance Market

In February 2013, we appointed a new leadership team from within our company, comprised of individuals who understood our vision for the future. We have a deep and experienced leadership team with extensive experience in the Florida personal residential insurance market. Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Sean P. Downes, has more than 25 years of experience in the insurance industry. Prior to Mr. Downes&#8217; arrival, all of our claims processing was outsourced to third parties. When Mr. Downes joined our company in 1999, he oversaw our claims operations and later oversaw the development of our vertically integrated structure. Mr. Downes has worked in the Florida insurance industry during all of its most recent active hurricane seasons. In particular, Mr. Downes led the claims team of a multi-line insurance claims adjusting corporation following Hurricane Andrew and served as Chief Operating Officer of UPCIC during the 2004 and 2005 active hurricane seasons. Jon W. Springer, our Chief Operating Officer, has 23 years of experience in the insurance industry, including 9 years leading a team of reinsurance specialists for Willis Re before joining us to implement and oversee our reinsurance program. Prior to becoming our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Springer was an Executive Vice President of URA and BARC.

We believe this leadership team has led us in a new strategic direction that has realized many benefits for our shareholders and policyholders, evidenced in part by the 71.5% increase in our stockholders&#8217; equity and the 82.9% increase in policyholders&#8217; surplus that we have realized since their tenure began. Further, they are supported by a group of highly qualified individuals with industry expertise and extensive operational history, which enables us to capitalize on our experience of having emerged from the 2004 and 2005 active hurricane seasons in sound financial condition, whereas many of our competitors are new to the market and have not experienced the challenges of an active Florida hurricane season.

Focus on Underwriting Discipline

We seek to consistently generate an underwriting profit on the business we write in hard and soft markets through carefully developed underwriting guidelines informed by our experience in evaluating risks and in handling and processing claims, which enable us to set prices relative to the risk we are assuming. By focusing on appropriately identifying and assessing key risks and exposures in the market, we believe we are able to accurately price eligible risks and generate consistent profits. We assumed only one group of policies from Citizens&#8217; predecessor in 1998 when we first began our operations. Since then, we have grown our business by leveraging our network of approximately 4,500 independent agents in Florida, and by expanding to other geographic areas that present market opportunities. We periodically review the renewal rates and quality of business generated by our independent agents to ensure underwriting profitability and work with agents where we believe improvement is warranted. As a result of this organic expansion and our vertically integrated structure, all of our operating units possess extensive knowledge of the personal residential homeowners insurance market.

Robust Internal Capabilities

We are vertically integrated with substantially all aspects of insurance underwriting, policy issuance, general administration and claims processing and settlement performed internally. Our ability to provide these services ourselves allows us to compress the cycle time of claim resolution in order to promptly pay valid claims and to control claims handling cost. In particular, by performing our own claims adjustment processes, we can better expedite meritorious claims as well as devote attention to potentially suspicious or inflated claims. As a result, we are generally able to begin the adjustment and mitigation process much earlier than if we relied more heavily on third parties, thereby reducing LAE and ultimate loss payouts. Our statutory net loss and LAE ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was 39.78%, lower than most of our peer companies. We are also able to retain a significant portion of the management and service fees that we and, indirectly, our reinsurers would otherwise pay to third parties for rendering such services. We do, however, intend to continue having a small portion of claims handled by select third parties as we believe that maintaining relationships with third-party service providers will benefit us in the event we need their assistance in handling claims due to a catastrophic event.

&#160;

Because most of our departments work together, we also believe our model provides a superior level of customer service for our policyholders, enhancing our reput ation and increasing the likelihood that our policyholders will renew their policies with us. Our monthly weighted average renewal retention rate for 2015 was 88.1%. We believe that when policyholders have high levels of customer satisfaction with our comp any, we are able to strengthen our reputation and relationships with our independent insurance agent network. 

Superior Claims Operations

Over the last decade, we have developed a proprietary claims administration system that allows us to efficiently process nearly all aspects of claims resolution for our policyholders. Our technology system has shortened claims handling and processing times, reduced associated claims resolution costs and has generated positive feedback from our policyholders and independent insurance agents. In addition, we recently launched our Fast Track Initiative, which expedites the claims settlement process to close certain types of claims in as little as 24 hours. The initiative sends select field adjusters to make on-site evaluations, with authorization to make payments to policyholders for certain types of claims. Our internal claims operation allows us to identify any trends or problems that may become apparent as claims are processed such that we can revise and bolster our underwriting guidelines as necessary in order to continue adequately pricing risks. Further, we continue to retain select third-party Florida claims administrators and adjusters as well as one national administrator to perform field services for and adjust a portion of our claims in order to maintain our relationships with them so that they can assist us, during periods of high claims volume, in providing high quality and timely service to our policyholders. We recognize the importance of claims processing and will continue to invest in this functionality. 

Strong Independent Agent Distribution Network

We have developed long-term relationships with a network of approximately 7,800 licensed independent insurance agents &#8211; with approximately 4,500 in Florida and approximately 3,300 outside of Florida. Of our 4,500 independent Florida agents, approximately 1,000 have written business with us for over a decade. Our relationships with our Florida independent agents are critical to our success in growing our business in the future and are key differentiators when compared with competitors that have relied upon assumptions of policies from Citizens for their growth and, as a result, may not have developed the same degree of loyalty with as large a group of independent agents in Florida. We believe we have been able to build this network due to our reputation, commitment to the Florida market, experience, and integrity in the underwriting process, as well as our consistency in offering our products through hard and soft markets. 

Further, the responsiveness of our operating units due to our vertically integrated structure enhances our relationships with our independent agents. By developing and controlling our proprietary technology system, we can rapidly respond to enhancement requests from our independent agents regarding our policy processing system. We undertook a survey of all of our independent agents in August 2015, and over 95.6% of the 770 agents who completed the survey reported being satisfied or more than satisfied with our system&#8217;s ease of use in performing functions such as generating quotes, binding policyholders and processing payments. We will continue to leverage our experience in Florida to build relationships with independent agents in other states in order to produce organic business in those states. 

MARKET

Florida

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, at June 30, 2015, Florida was the third largest state in terms of population, with approximately 20 million people. The University of Florida Bureau of Economic and Business Research estimates that Florida is expected to reach a population of approximately 26 million people by 2040, an increase of 38% from 2010. Property ownership and development represent key drivers of the Florida economy. Because of its location, Florida is exposed to an increased risk of hurricanes during the entire six months of the Atlantic hurricane season, which spans from June 1 through November 30. While a significant hurricane has not made landfall in Florida since 2005, eight hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, including Hurricanes Charley, Katrina, Rita and Wilma, caused combined estimated nationwide property damage of over $127 billion, a significant portion of which occurred in Florida. As a result, availability of personal residential insurance and claims servicing are vitally important to Florida residents. 

The Florida residential insurance market is highly fragmented and dominated by in-state insurance companies, including Citizens. Significant dislocation in the Florida property insurance market began following Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and accelerated following the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. National and regional insurers significantly reduced their share of the market in Florida between 1999 and 2012. As national and regional insurance companies reduced their exposure in Florida, Citizens, which was at the time and remains today, by law, an insurer of last resort, increased efforts to provide affordable residential insurance to those residents unable to obtain coverage in the private market. As a result, Citizens&#8217; policy count grew from roughly 800,000 policies in 2005 to a peak level of approximately 1.5 million policies in late 2011. To reduce Citizens&#8217; risk exposure, beginning in 2010, Florida elected officials 

&#160;

encouraged Citizens to focus on reducing the size of its portfolio by returning policies to the private market. Depopulation efforts have been successful, as Citizens&#8217; policy count at Septemb er 30, 2015 was approximately 5 7 0 ,000. To be eligible for a Citizens policy, an appl icant must either be denied comparable coverage offers from the private insurance market or have received coverage offerings from the private insurance market requiring premium payments that are more than 15% higher than a comparable Citizens policy. 

According to data compiled by the FLOIR, Citizens was the largest residential insurer in Florida as of September 30, 2015, with a market share of approximately 9.96% based on total direct premiums written in-force for personal residential insurance (excluding mobile homeowners and farmowners). As of December 31, 2015, less than 1,000 of our 550,800 Florida in-force policies, or 0.2%, were assumed from Citizens&#8217; predecessor, as compared to some of our competitors who received approval from Citizens to assume as many as 55,000 to 173,000 policies in each of 2014 and 2015 alone. We believe we have the opportunity to significantly expand the size of our personal residential homeowners insurance business both inside and outside of Florida by pursuing organic growth and have demonstrated our ability to do so over the past 10 years.

All residential insurance companies that write business in Florida, including us, are required to obtain a form of reinsurance through the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (the &#8220;FHCF&#8221;), a state-sponsored entity that provides a layer of reinsurance protection at a price that is typically lower than what would otherwise be available in the general market. The purpose of the FHCF is to protect and advance the state&#8217;s interest in maintaining insurance capacity in Florida by providing reimbursements to insurers for a portion of their catastrophe hurricane losses. The FHCF provides limited capacity, which may be adjusted by statute from time to time. 

Other States

While we are concentrated in Florida, part of our strategy is to continue our expansion outside of Florida primarily to take advantage of opportunities to write profitable business as well as to diversify our revenue and risk. We are targeting states with underserved homeowners insurance markets where we believe there is price adequacy for our products and where policyholders would benefit from our market knowledge and integrated service model. We write homeowners policies in Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina, and are also licensed to issue policies in Alabama, Michigan, New Hampshire, Virginia and West Virginia. We look to expand to markets that have opportunities for reasoned, profitable growth and that allow us to position ourselves to take advantage of market dislocation opportunities similar to what we capitalized on in Florida following the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. 

COMPETITION

The market for personal residential homeowners insurance is highly competitive. In our primary market, Florida, there are approximately 127 licensed insurance companies that write in-force homeowners policies. See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;Our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in a highly competitive insurance industry.&#8221; 

The table below shows policy count, direct written premium in-force, total insured value and market share (excluding mobile homeowners and farmowners) for the top 20 personal residential homeowners insurance companies by direct written premium in Florida as of September 30, 2015, which is the most recent date that the information is publicly available. We compete to varying degrees with all of these companies and others, including large national carriers.

The information displayed in the table above is compiled and published by the FLOIR as of September 30, 2015 based on information filings submitted quarterly by all Florida licensed insurance companies and downloaded from FLOIR&#8217;s database as of February 17, 2016. Such information is presented for each individual company and is not consolidated or aggregated. State Farm Florida Insurance Company does not report this type of information to the FLOIR. Dollar values are in thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand. 

** 

Total insured values are for policies in-force that include wind coverage. 

We compete primarily on the basis of the strength of our distribution network, high-quality service to our independent agents and policyholders, our reputation and commitment to the Florida market, claims handling ability, product features tailored to our markets and price. Our successful track record in writing homeowners insurance in catastrophe-exposed areas has enabled us to develop sophisticated risk selection and pricing techniques that endeavor to identify desirable risks and accurately reflect the risk of loss while allowing us to be competitive in our target markets. This risk selection and pricing approach allows us to profitably offer competitive products in areas that have a high demand for property insurance yet are underserved by the national carriers. Each of the Insurance Entities is currently rated &#8220;A&#8221; (&#8220;Exceptional&#8221;) by Demotech, Inc. (&#8220;Demotech&#8221;), a rating agency specializing in evaluating the financial stability of insurers. 

&#160;

PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTION 

Products

Our focus and our primary product is personal residential insurance, which accounts for the vast majority of business that we write. Our homeowners insurance products provide policyholders with the ability to receive homeowners, renters, condominium, dwelling, fire, other structures, personal property, personal liability and personal articles coverages. In 2015, we wrote an average of 16,110 new policies per month, an increase of 30% as compared to the prior year, and homeowners policies produced direct written premium of $813.9 million. Homeowners policies accounted for 92.1% of our total direct written premium, with the remaining 7.9% comprised of fire and allied lines coverage.

The nature of our business, with respect to both claims and sales, tends to be seasonal over the course of a year, reflecting consumer behaviors in connection with the Florida residential real estate market and the need to be insured before the start of the hurricane season. The amount of written premium tends to increase just prior to the second quarter of our fiscal year and to decrease approaching the fourth quarter. We also face cyclicality resulting from hard and soft market cycles. See &#8220; Item 1A&#8212; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;Our financial condition and operating results and the financial condition and operating results of our Insurance Entities may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty insurance business.&#8221;

The geographical distribution of our policies in-force, in-force premium and total insured value for Florida by county were as follows as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand):

Product Pricing 

The premiums we charge are based on rates specific to individual risks and locations and are generally subject to regulatory review and approval before they are implemented. We periodically submit our rate revisions to regulators as required by law or as we deem necessary or appropriate for our business. The premiums we charge to policyholders are affected by legislative enactments and administrative rules, including state-mandated programs in Florida requiring residential property insurance companies like us to provide premium discounts when policyholders verify that insured properties have certain construction features or windstorm loss reduction features. 

The following table shows UPCIC&#8217;s most recently approved rate changes in Florida. All percentage increases and decreases are expressed as statewide averages.

Distribution

We market and sell our products solely through our network of approximately 7,800 licensed independent agents, which we continue to build both in Florida and in other states. Of these independent agents, the top 20% accounted for approximately 80% of our direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2015. Currently we have approximately 4,500 independent agents in Florida and approximately 3,300 independent agents outside of Florida. Our relationships with independent agents and their relationships with their customers are critical to our ability to identify, attract and retain profitable business. See &#8220; Item 1A&#8212; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;Because we rely on independent insurance agents, the loss of these independent agent relationships and the business they control or our ability to attract new independent agents could have an adverse impact on our business.&#8221; We have developed our independent agency distribution channel since our inception, and we believe we have built significant credibility and loyalty within the independent agent community in the states in which we operate, particularly Florida. We actively participate in the recruitment and training of our independent agents and provide each agency with training sessions on topics such as submitting claims and underwriting guidelines, either over the phone or through an internet portal. We also engage a third-party market representative to assist in ongoing training and recruitment initiatives in all of the states in which we write business. 

A key part of our distribution strategy is to utilize an attractive commission-based compensation plan as an incentive for independent agents to place business with us. We also attempt to provide excellent service to our independent agents and brokers, maintaining a consistent partnership with our independent agents and a consistent presence in our target markets through hard and soft market cycles. Our internal staff and specialists provide support to our independent agents, including use of various technologies to assist with the delivery of service to our policyholders. Our independent agents have access to all policy and payment information through our online, proprietary system. This system allows our independent agents to provide quotes within minutes, and because we control our technology, we are able to quickly respond to agents who need troubleshooting assistance or who offer recommendations for improvement. This system has evolved into a highly valued tool that enables agents to quickly understand the status of a policy and assist their clients with any policy-related questions. We regularly monitor and enhance the system to provide the best point of sale 

&#160;

tools possible. Agents are provided dedicated internal contacts should they need assistance, and a gencies are proactively contacted on a quarterly basis to solicit feedback . 

As a result of the superior service and compensation we provide, we have relatively little turnover among many of our key independent agents. Approximately 1,000, or 13%, of our independent agents have relationships with us that span a decade or more.

Services

We are vertically integrated with substantially all aspects of insurance underwriting, policy issuance, general administration and claims processing and settlement performed internally, which allows us to retain a majority of the economics associated with the issuance and administration of our insurance policies in-force. Vertical integration also maintains quality service throughout the policy life cycle. Below is a summary of the services we provide. 

Underwriting

All underwriting is performed internally utilizing our state-approved underwriting manuals as the basis of our rate-making and risk assessment. Our manuals have been developed and enhanced over a number of years based on our deep knowledge of the homeowners insurance industry, and based on an ongoing analysis of our own loss experience. Initially, all new business must be submitted to us through our proprietary policy processing system and risk criteria which allows our independent agent partners to generate quotes and bind policies subject to compliance with our binding authority guidelines and risk criteria. Policies that are bound are further reviewed by our underwriting staff for accuracy of data, including reports of on-site inspections. Our underwriting process is constantly evolving as new and different type of risks and claim types become prevalent. However, see &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;The failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.&#8221;

Policy Administration

We have developed a proprietary suite of applications that provide underwriting, policy and claim administration services, including billing, policy maintenance, inspections, refunds, commissions and data analysis. Our proprietary rating engine aligns with various state requirements to support our geographic expansion. This sophisticated policy processing system is solely managed by our employees and enhancements are implemented while adhering to strict internal control requirements to ensure business continuity. 

Claims Administration

We closely manage all aspects of the claims process, from processing the initial filing to claim conclusion. When a policyholder contacts us to report a claim, members of our claims department create a claim file and aggregate the appropriate supporting documentation. Claims are then reviewed by our managers and staff adjusters, who assess the extent of the loss, complete on-site investigations when required, and determine the resources needed to adjust each claim. We perform or supervise the adjusting services rendered for our policyholders at all stages of the claims process, which we believe allows us to reduce cost and provide a high level of customer service. We assign a small percentage of field inspections to third-party adjusters in order to maintain relationships that will allow us to continue to provide high quality and timely service following a catastrophe or any other period of unusually high claim volume.

On March 5, 2015, we acquired Aplin Peer &#38; Associates Inc., an independent claims adjusting firm, to supplement our already sizable claims function. We now have 175 claims personnel on staff. In 2015, our average time to close claims has decreased by over a week as compared to 2013 and 2014. Additionally, despite an increase of 12.3% in our policies in-force in 2015, we have reduced claims operating expenses by 2.3% as compared to 2014.

Reinsurance Intermediary

We manage our reinsurance program through our internal reinsurance intermediary, BARC, in conjunction with URA. Almost 10 years ago, we hired a dedicated team of reinsurance specialists from Willis Re, including our Chief Operating Officer, Jon W. Springer, to design a customized reinsurance strategy for us and to develop our in-house analytical capabilities. Our reinsurance team has an average of 24 years of knowledge and expertise of the reinsurance industry. We have two experienced actuaries and analytics modeling personnel on staff at BARC to assist in evaluating and designing our reinsurance program. Not only do we receive a portion of the fees that otherwise would be paid in commissions to a third-party reinsurance intermediary, we also develop and maintain long-term relationships with our reinsurers. We also utilize Aon Benfield as a third-party reinsurance intermediary as needed, enabling us to capitalize on its market experience and knowledge as well as our internal capabilities. Aon Benfield works closely with our teams at 

&#160;

BARC and URA in designing our reinsurance program to obtain favorable pricing, as well as continually evaluating prevailing costs and the level of coverage we feel we need in order to capitalize on favor able market conditions. 

REINSURANCE

Developing and implementing our reinsurance strategy to adequately protect us in the event of one or more catastrophes while maintaining efficient reinsurance costs has been a key focus for our leadership team. In recent years, the property and casualty insurance market has experienced a substantial increase in the availability of property catastrophe reinsurance resulting from the increased supply of capital from non-traditional reinsurance providers, including private capital and hedge funds. This increased capital supply, coupled with a lack of recent significant catastrophic activity in Florida and elsewhere around the world, and underwriting improvements, such as Florida&#8217;s wind mitigation efforts to strengthen homes subject to wind events, has reduced the cost of property catastrophe reinsurance, directly benefitting significant reinsurance buyers, such as us. 

In order to limit our potential exposure to catastrophic events, we purchase significant reinsurance from third-party reinsurers. We rely on third-party reinsurers and the FHCF and do not have any captive or affiliated reinsurance arrangements in place. The FLOIR requires us and all insurance companies doing business in Florida to have a certain amount of capital and reinsurance coverage in order to cover losses upon the occurrence of a single catastrophic event and a series of catastrophic events occurring in the same hurricane season. Our 2015-2016 reinsurance program meets and provides reinsurance in excess of the FLOIR&#8217;s requirements, which are based on, among other things, the probable maximum loss that we would incur from an individual catastrophic event estimated to occur once in every 100 years based on our portfolio of insured risks and a series of stress test catastrophe loss scenarios based on past historical events. As respects the single catastrophic event, the nature, severity and location of the event giving rise to such a probable maximum loss differs for each insurer depending on the insurer&#8217;s portfolio of insured risks, including, among other things, the geographic concentration of insured value within the insurer&#8217;s portfolio. Accordingly, a particular catastrophic event could be a one-in-100 year loss event for one insurance company while having a greater or lesser probability of occurrence for another insurance company.

We believe our retention under the reinsurance program is appropriate and structured to protect our policyholders. We test the sufficiency of our reinsurance program by subjecting our personal residential exposures to statistical testing using a third-party hurricane model, RMS RiskLink v15.0 (Build 1625). This model combines simulations of the natural occurrence patterns and characteristics of hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other catastrophes with information on property values, construction types and occupancy classes. The model outputs provide information concerning the potential for large losses before they occur so companies can prepare for their financial impact . 

UPCIC&#8217;s Reinsurance Program

Third-Party Reinsurance

Our annual reinsurance program, which is segmented into layers of coverage, as is industry practice, protects us against excess property catastrophe losses. Our 2015-2016 reinsurance program includes the mandatory coverage required by law to be placed with the FHCF (in which we have elected to participate at 90%, or the highest level), and also includes private reinsurance below, alongside and above the FHCF layer. In placing our 2015-2016 reinsurance program, we obtained multiple years of coverage for a portion of the program. We believe this multi-year arrangement will allow us to capitalize on favorable pricing and contract terms and conditions and allow us to mitigate uncertainty with respect to the price of future reinsurance coverage, our single largest cost. For 2015-2016, we eliminated our quota share reinsurance effective as of June 1, 2015, while obtaining additional excess of loss catastrophe coverage. We believe that this new structure will continue to protect us in years in which a catastrophe may occur, and in non-catastrophe years will decrease our reinsurance costs and increase the amount of premium we retain. These lower costs and higher premium retention will enable us to further increase our stockholders&#8217; equity in order to profitably grow our business.

We have used the model results noted above to stress test the completeness of the program by simulating a recurrence of the 2004 calendar year, in which four large catastrophic hurricanes made landfall in Florida. This season is considered to be the worst catastrophic year in Florida&#8217;s recorded history. Assuming the reoccurrence of the 2004 calendar year events, including the same geographic path of each such hurricane, the modeled estimated net loss to us in 2015, with the reinsurance coverage described herein, would be approximately $84 million (after tax, net of all reinsurance recoveries). We estimate that, based on our portfolio of insured risks as of December 31, 2015, a repeat of the four 2004 calendar year events would have exhausted approximately 18.4% of our property catastrophe reinsurance coverage 

&#160;

UPCIC&#8217;s Retention 

UPCIC has a net retention of $35 million per catastrophe event for losses incurred up to a first event loss of $2.24 billion. UPCIC purchases a separate underlying cover to further reduce its retention for all losses occurring in Hawaii. With this cover, UPCIC retains only $10 million under its program in Hawaii. These retention amounts are gross of any potential tax benefit we would receive in paying such losses.

First Layer 

Immediately above UPCIC&#8217;s net retention, we have $55 million of reinsurance coverage from third-party reinsurers for up to four separate catastrophic events, for all states. Specifically, we have purchased reinsurance coverage for the first and third catastrophic events, and each such coverage allows for one reinstatement upon the payment of reinstatement premiums, which would cover the second and fourth catastrophic events. We have purchased reinstatement premium protection to pay the required premium necessary for the initial reinstatement of this coverage for a second catastrophic event.

Second Layer 

Above the first layer, for losses exceeding $90 million, we have purchased a second layer of coverage for losses up to $455 million &#8211; in other words, for the next $355 million of losses. This coverage has been obtained from multiple contracts as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 

58% of $355 million in excess of $90 million provides coverage on a multi-year basis through May 31, 2018; 

&#160;

&#183; 

12% of $355 million in excess of $90 million provides coverage for the 2015-2016 period; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the remaining 30% of $355 million in excess of $90 million is provided by the following: 

&#160;

o 

the second and final year of multi-year coverage for 30% of $285 million in excess of $90 million for the 2015-2016 period; and 

&#160;

o 

30% of $70 million in excess of $375 million for the 2015-2016 period. 

In this layer, to the extent that all of our coverage or a portion thereof is exhausted in a catastrophic event, we have purchased reinstatement premium protection insurance to pay the required premium necessary for the reinstatement of these coverages. These coverages extend to all states, except with respect to the second year of the $285 million in excess of $90 million coverage, which extends only to Florida.

Third and Fourth Layers 

In the third and fourth layers, we have purchased reinsurance for $128 million of coverage in excess of $445 million in losses incurred by us (net of the FHCF layer) and $275 million of coverage in excess of $573 million in losses incurred by us (net of the FHCF layer), respectively. Both layers&#8217; coverage extends to all states.

UPCIC structures its reinsurance coverage into layers and utilizes a cascading feature such that the second, third and fourth reinsurance layers all attach at $90 million. Any layers above the $90 million attachment point are excess of loss over the immediately preceding layer. If the aggregate limit of the preceding layer is exhausted, the next layer cascades down in its place for future events. This means that, unless losses exhaust the top layer of our coverage, we are exposed to only $35 million in losses, pre-tax, per catastrophe for each of the first four events. In addition to tax benefits that could reduce our ultimate loss, we would expect fees paid to our subsidiary service providers by our Insurance Entities and, indirectly, our reinsurers, would also increase during an active hurricane season, which could also offset claim-related losses we would have to pay on our insurance policies.

FHCF

UPCIC&#8217;s third-party reinsurance program supplements the FHCF coverage we are required to purchase every year. The limit and retention of the FHCF coverage we receive each year is subject to upward or downward adjustment based on, among other things, submitted exposures to the FHCF by all participants. As of December 1, 2015, we estimate our FHCF coverage includes a maximum provisional limit of 90% of $1,470.6 million, or $1,323.5 million, in excess of $491.7 million. Coverage purchased from third-party reinsurers, as described above, adjusts to fill in gaps in FHCF coverage. The FHCF coverage cannot be reinstated once exhausted, but it does provide coverage for multiple events. The FHCF coverage extends only to losses to our Florida portfolio due to a landfalling hurricane. 

&#160;

The third-party reinsurance we purchase for UPCIC is therefore net of FHCF recovery. When our FHCF and third-party reinsurance coverages are taken together, UPCIC has reinsurance coverage of up to $2,242.1 million for the first event, as illustrated by the graphic below. Should a catastrophic event occur, w e would retain $35 million pre-tax for each catastrophic event, and would also be responsible for any additional losses that exceed our top layer of coverage . 

*Layer cascades to $90M

APPCIC&#8217;s Reinsurance Program

Third-Party Reinsurance

APPCIC&#8217;s Retention 

APPCIC has a net retention of $2 million for all losses per catastrophe event for losses incurred up to a first event loss of $41.2 million. This retention amount is gross of any potential tax benefit we would receive in paying such losses.

First Layer 

Immediately above APPCIC&#8217;s net retention we have $5.5 million of reinsurance coverage from third-party reinsurers. Specifically, we have purchased reinsurance coverage for the first event, and such coverage allows for one reinstatement upon the payment of reinstatement premiums, which would cover the second and potentially more catastrophic events. We have purchased reinstatement 

&#160;

premium protection to pay the required premium necessary for the initial reinstatement of this coverage for a second catastrophic event. 

Second and Third Layers 

In the second and third layers, we have purchased reinsurance for $2.2 million of coverage in excess of $7.5 million in losses incurred by us (net of the FHCF layer) and $12 million of coverage in excess of $9.7 million in losses incurred by us (net of the FHCF layer), respectively. 

APPCIC structures its reinsurance coverage into layers and utilizes a cascading feature such that the second and third reinsurance layers all attach at $2 million. Any layers above the $2 million attachment point are excess of loss over the immediately preceding layer. If the aggregate limit of the preceding layer is exhausted, the next layer cascades down in its place for future events. This means that, unless losses exhaust the top layer of our coverage, we are only exposed to $2 million in losses, pre-tax, per catastrophe for each of the first two events. In addition to tax benefits that could reduce our ultimate loss, we would expect fees paid to our subsidiary service providers by our Insurance Entities and, indirectly, our reinsurers would also increase during an active hurricane season, which could also offset losses we would have to pay on our insurance policies.

FHCF

APPCIC&#8217;s third-party reinsurance program is used to supplement the FHCF reinsurance we are required to purchase every year. The limit and retention of the FHCF coverage we receive each year is subject to upward or downward adjustment based on, among other things, submitted exposures to the FHCF by all participants. As of December 1, 2015, we estimate our FHCF coverage includes a maximum provisional limit of 90% of $21.7 million, or $19.53 million, in excess of $6.9 million. Factoring in our estimated coverage under the FHCF, we purchase coverage alongside our FHCF coverage from third-party reinsurers as described above, which adjusts to fill in gaps in FHCF coverage. The FHCF coverage cannot be reinstated once exhausted, but it does provide coverage for multiple events. The FHCF coverage extends only to losses to our portfolio impacted by a landfalling hurricane. 

Multiple Line Excess of Loss

The third-party reinsurance we purchase for APPCIC is therefore net of FHCF recovery. When our FHCF and third-party reinsurance coverages are taken together, APPCIC has reinsurance coverage of up to $41.7 million, as illustrated by the graphic below. Should a catastrophic event occur, we would retain $2 million pre-tax for each catastrophic event, and would also be responsible for any additional losses that exceed our top layer of coverage.

&#160;

&#160;

*Layer cascades to $2M

&#160;

Multiple Line Excess of Loss

APPCIC also purchases extensive multiple line excess per risk reinsurance with various reinsurers due to the high valued risks it insures. Under this multiple line excess per risk contract, APPCIC has coverage of $8.5 million in excess of $0.5 million ultimate net loss for each risk and each property loss, and $1 million in excess of $0.3 million for each casualty loss. A $19.5 million aggregate limit applies to the term of the contract for property related losses and a $2.0 million aggregate limit applies to the term of the contract for casualty-related losses. This contract also contains a profit sharing feature available to APPCIC if the contract meets specific performance measures. 

INVESTMENTS

We conduct investment activities through each of the Insurance Entities and UVE. We have retained third-party investment advisers to advise us and manage our securities portfolio, other than cash-based equivalents. Our Board&#8217;s Investment Committee oversees these advisers and reports overall investment results to our Board of Directors, at least on a quarterly basis. 

The investment activities of the Insurance Entities are subject to regulation and supervision by the FLOIR. See &#8220;&#8212; Government Regulation and Initiatives . &#8221; The Insurance Entities may only make investments that are consistent with regulatory guidelines, and our investment policies for the Insurance Entities accordingly limit the amount of investments in, among other things, non-investment grade fixed maturity securities (including high-yield bonds) and the amount of total investments in preferred stock and common stock. While we seek to appropriately limit the size and scope of investments in our portfolio, UVE is not similarly restricted by Florida law. Therefore, the investments made by UVE may significantly differ from those made by the Insurance Entities. We do not purchase securities on margin.

The primary objectives of our investment portfolio are the preservation of capital and providing adequate liquidity for claims payments and other cash needs. Our investment portfolio&#8217;s secondary investment objective is to provide a total rate of return with an 

&#160;

emphasis on investment income. We focus on relatively short-term i nvestments, with approximately 12.97 % of t he fair value of our portfolio with contractual maturities due in one year or less, and another 50.19 % due after one year but before five years. 

See &#8220; Item 8&#8212;Note 3 (Investments) &#8221; and &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Investments&#8221; for more information about our investments. 

LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE

We generally use the terms &#8220;loss&#8221; or &#8220;losses&#8221; to refer to both loss and LAE. We establish reserves for both reported and unreported unpaid losses that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date for amounts we estimate we will be required to pay in the future. Our policy is to establish these loss reserves after considering all information known to us at each reporting period. In many cases, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss and our payment of a liability claim. Liability claims historically tend to have longer time lapses between the occurrence of the event, the reporting of the claim to the Insurance Entities and the final settlement than do property claims. Liability claims often involve third parties filing suit and ensuing litigation. By comparison, property damage claims tend to be reported in a relatively shorter period of time with the vast majority of these claims resulting in an adjustment without litigation. Accordingly, at any given point in time, our loss reserve represents our best estimate of the ultimate settlement and administration cost of our insured claims incurred and unpaid. Since the process of estimating loss reserves requires significant judgment due to a number of variables, such as fluctuations in inflation, judicial decisions, legislative changes and changes in claims handling procedures, our ultimate liability will likely differ from these estimates. See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.&#8221; We revise our reserve for unpaid losses as additional information becomes available, and reflect adjustments, if any, in our earnings in the periods in which we determine the adjustments are necessary.

When a claim involving a probable loss is reported, we establish a liability for the estimated amount of our ultimate loss and LAE payments. The estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss is based upon such factors as the type of loss, jurisdiction of the occurrence, knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, severity of injury or damage, potential for ultimate exposure, estimate of liability on the part of the insured, past experience with similar claims and the applicable policy provisions. All newly reported claims begin with an initial average liability. That claim is then evaluated and the liability is adjusted upward or downward according to the facts and damages of that particular claim. In addition, management aggregates liabilities to provide for losses incurred but not reported ( &#8220; IBNR &#8221; ). We utilize independent actuaries to help establish liabilities for unpaid losses and LAE. We do not discount the liability for unpaid losses and LAE for financial statement purposes. As discussed above, we maintain an in-house claims staff that monitors and directs all aspects of our claims process, and oversees claims processed by third parties.

The estimates of the liability for unpaid losses and LAE are subject to the effect of trends in claims severity and frequency and are continually reviewed. As part of this process, we review historical data and consider various factors, including known and anticipated legal developments, changes in social attitudes, inflation and economic conditions. As experience develops and other data become available, these estimates are revised, as required, resulting in increases or decreases to the existing liability for unpaid losses and LAE. Adjustments are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made and the liabilities may deviate substantially from prior estimates. See &#8220; Item 1A&#8212; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212;Actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.&#8221;

Government Regulation and Initiatives 

We are subject to extensive regulation in the markets we serve, primarily at the state level, and will be subject to the regulations of any other states in which we seek to conduct business in the future. These regulations cover all aspects of our business and are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. Such regulations relate to authorized lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, allowable rates and forms, investment parameters, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, market conduct, maximum amount allowable for premium financing service charges and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of our business. 

Financial Reporting 

The Insurance Entities prepare and file with various insurance regulatory authorities quarterly and annual audited financial statements in accordance with requirements established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) and adopted by administrative rules in Florida as the Insurance Entities &#8217; domiciliary state. The Insurance Entities &#8217; financial statements are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles, which differ from United States generally accepted accounting principles.

&#160;

Examinations 

As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic financial examinations of the books, records, accounts and operations of insurance companies that are domiciled in their states. In general, insurance regulatory authorities defer to the insurance regulatory authority in the state in which an insurer is domiciled; however, insurance regulatory authorities in any state in which we operate may conduct examinations at their discretion. Under Florida law, these examinations generally occur every five years, although the FLOIR may conduct limited or full scope reviews more frequently. The financial examination reports are available to the public at the conclusion of the examination process. In addition, state insurance regulatory authorities may make inquiries, conduct investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to insurers &#8217; compliance with applicable insurance laws and regulations. These inquiries or examinations may address, among other things, the form and content of disclosures to consumers, advertising, sales practices, claims practices and complaint handling. The reports arising from insurance authorities &#8217; examination processes typically are available to the public at the conclusion of the examinations.

NAIC 

The NAIC is an organization whose mandate is to benefit state insurance regulatory authorities and consumers by promulgating model insurance laws and regulations for adoption by the states. The NAIC also provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance through its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (the &#8220; Manual &#8221; ). However, model insurance laws and regulations are only effective when adopted by the states, and statutory accounting and reporting principles continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices. Changes to the Manual or modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the statutory capital and surplus of the Insurance Entities. We cannot predict what additional compliance costs these pending model laws or regulations may impose if adopted by Florida or other states in the future.

Insurance Holding Company Laws 

UVE, as the ultimate parent company of the Insurance Entities, is subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Florida. These laws, among other things , (i) require us to file periodic information with the FLOIR, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations, (ii) regulate certain transactions between us and our affiliates, including the amount of dividends and other distributions, the terms of surplus notes and amounts that our affiliates can charge the Insurance Entities for services such as policy administration and claims administration, and (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. 

The Florida Insurance Code prohibits any person from acquiring control of the Insurance Entities or their holding companies unless that person has filed a notification with specified information with the FLOIR and has obtained the FLOIR &#8217; s prior approval. Under the Florida Insurance Code, acquiring 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered an acquisition of control of the insurance company, although such presumption may be rebutted. Some U.S. state insurance laws require prior notification to state insurance regulators of an acquisition of control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of control of UVE (in particular through an unsolicited transaction), even if the shareholders of UVE might consider such transaction to be desirable. See &#8220; Item 1A&#8212; Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry&#8212;We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth.&#8221;

Insurance holding company regulations also govern the amount any affiliate of the holding company may charge insurance affiliates for services (e.g., claims adjustment, administration, management fees and commissions). Further, insurance holding company regulations may also require prior approval of insurance regulators for amendments to or terminations of certain affiliate agreements.

Capital Requirements

State insurance authorities monitor insurance companies &#8217; solvency and capital requirements using various statutory requirements and industry ratios. Initially, states require minimum capital levels based on the lines of business written by a company, and set requirements regarding the ongoing amount and composition of capital. State regulators also require the deposit of state deposits in each state. See &#8220;Item 8&#8212;Note 5 (Insurance Operations)&#8221; for more information about state deposits. As a company grows, additional capital measures and standards may be implemented by a regulator. Regulatory authorities use a risk-based capital ( &#8220; RBC &#8221; ) model published by the NAIC to monitor and regulate the solvency of licensed property and casualty insurance companies. These guidelines measure three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing, (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk and (iii) other business risks. Most states, including Florida, have enacted the NAIC guidelines as statutory requirements, and insurers having less surplus than required by applicable statutes and ratios are subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on the level of capital inadequacy. As of December 31, 2015, the Insurance Entities &#8217; RBC ratios exceed applicable statutory requirements. See &#8220; Item 1A&#8212; Risk Factors&#8212;

&#160;

Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry&#8212;The amount of statutory capital and surplus that each of the Insurance Entities has and the amount of statuto ry capital and surplus it must hold can vary and are sensitive to a number of factors outside our control, including market conditions and the regulatory environment and rules.&#8221; 

Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions 

As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, UVE relies on payments from its subsidiaries as its principal sources of cash to pay dividends and meet its obligations. Dividends paid by our subsidiaries other than the Insurance Entities are not subject to the statutory restrictions set forth in the Florida Insurance Code. However, insurance holding company regulations govern the amount that any affiliate within the holding company system may charge any of the Insurance Entities for services. See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry&#8212;We are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth.&#8221; Dividends paid to our shareholders in 2015 were paid from the earnings of UVE and its non-insurance subsidiaries and not from the capital and surplus of the Insurance Entities. State insurance laws govern the payment of dividends by insurance companies. The maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by Florida insurance companies without prior approval of the Commissioner of the FLOIR is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus. The maximum dividend that may be paid by the Insurance Entities to UVE without prior approval is limited to the lesser of statutory net income from operations of the preceding calendar year or statutory unassigned surplus as of the preceding year end. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Insurance Entities did not pay dividends to UVE. 

Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions

During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies in Florida and in other states have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations (i) restrict certain policy non-renewals or cancellations and require advance notice on certain policy non-renewals and (ii) from a practical standpoint, limit rate increases or decrease rates permitted to be charged.

Most states, including Florida, also have insurance laws requiring that rate schedules and other information be filed with the insurance regulatory authority. The insurance regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the rates are inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. Rates, which are not necessarily uniform for all insurers, vary by class of business, hazard covered and size of risk. 

Most states, including Florida, require licensure or insurance regulatory authority approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company&#8217;s business plan, solvency, reinsurance, character of its officers and directors, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company. The insurance regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval for an insurer to write new lines of business. 

Privacy Regulation 

Federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of non-public personal information and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of non-public personal information.

Statutory Insurance Organizations

Many states in which the Insurance Entities operate have statutorily-mandated insurance organizations or other insurance mechanisms in which the Insurance Entities are required to participate or to potentially pay assessments. Each state has insurance guaranty association laws providing for the payment of policyholders &#8217; claims when insurance companies doing business in that state become impaired or insolvent. These guaranty associations typically are funded by assessments on insurance companies transacting business in the respective states. When the Insurance Entities are subject to assessments they generally must remit the assessed amounts to the guaranty associations. The Insurance Entities subsequently seek to recover the assessed amounts through recoupments from policyholders. In the event the Insurance Entities are not able to fully recoup the amounts of those assessments, such unrecovered amounts can be credited against future assessments, or the remaining receivable may be written off. While we cannot predict the amount or timing of future guaranty association assessments, we believe that any such assessments will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. See &#8220;Item 1A&#8212;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to the Insurance Industry&#8212;Regulations limiting rate changes and requiring us to participate in loss sharing or assessments may decrease our profitability.&#8221;

&#160;

Several states, including Florida, have insurance mechanisms that provide insurance to consumers who are not otherwise ab le to obtain coverage in the private insurance market. The largest such insurance mechanism is Citizens. The degree to which these state-authorized insurance mechanisms compete with private insurers such as the Insurance Entities varies over time depending on market and public policy considerations beyond our control. In addition, these insurance mechanisms often rely on assessments of insurers to cover any operating shortfalls. Also, most property and casualty insurers operating in Florida, including the I nsurance Entities, are subject to assessment if the FHCF lacks sufficient claims-paying resources to meet its reimbursement obligations to insurers. FHCF assessments are added to policyholders &#8217; premiums and are collected and remitted by the Insurance Entit ies .
