 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Vringo, Inc. (&#8220;Vringo&#8221;) is engaged in the innovation, development and monetization of intellectual property, as well as the commercialization and distribution of wire-free power and rugged computing devices. Our company has three operating segments:

&#160;

&#8226;

Intellectual Property &#160;

&#8226; Fli Charge &#160;

&#8226; Group Mobile &#160;

On July 19, 2012, we consummated a merger with Innovate/Protect, Inc., then a privately held Delaware corporation (&#8220;I/P&#8221;). On August 9, 2012, we acquired a patent portfolio from Nokia Corporation (&#8220;Nokia&#8221;), comprised of 124 patent families with counterparts in certain jurisdictions worldwide, for $22,000,000. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, to the extent that the gross revenue, as defined by the agreement, exceeds $22,000,000, we are obligated to pay Nokia a royalty of 35% of such excess.

&#160;

On October 15, 2015, we acquired 100% of International Development Group Limited (&#8220;IDG&#8221;), a holding company, including its two subsidiaries: fliCharge International Ltd. (&#8220;Fli Charge&#8221;) and Group Mobile International, LLC (&#8220;Group Mobile&#8221;). IDG owned 70% of Fli Charge and 100% of Group Mobile. The purchase was a stock purchase whereby we acquired the entire interest in IDG in exchange for shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series B Preferred&#8221;) and unregistered shares of our common stock. The total value of the consideration was $5,571,000. On December 28, 2015, we acquired the remaining 30% of Fli Charge from third party shareholders in exchange for shares of our unregistered common stock. Refer to Business &#8211; Recent Developments for further discussion.

&#160;

Fli Charge owns a patented conductive wire-free charging technology and is focused on the development and commercialization of its technology through the direct to consumer sale of enablements as well as partnerships and licensing agreements in various industries. Fli Charge is currently working with partners that are interested in implementing Fli Charge technology for smart furniture, Original Equipment Manufacturers (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) and after-market automobiles, and vaporizers. Fli Charge&#8217;s business model is to license its technology in exchange for recurring licensing revenue, as well as to manufacture and commercialize its own conductive charging pads and associated cases for phones, tablets and laptops.

&#160;

Group Mobile is a full service reseller of rugged computers, rugged tablets, rugged mobile devices, accessories and other related products geared toward emergency first responders, municipalities and corporations. In addition, Group Mobile specializes in high-quality customer support.

&#160;

Prior to December 31, 2013, we operated a global platform for the distribution of mobile social applications and services. On February 18, 2014, we sold our mobile social application business to InfoMedia Services Limited (&#8220;InfoMedia&#8221;), receiving an 8.25% ownership interest in InfoMedia as consideration and a seat on the board of directors of InfoMedia. As part of the transaction, we have the opportunity to license certain intellectual property assets and work with InfoMedia to identify and protect new intellectual property.

&#160;

Each of our operating segments is described below.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our Intellectual Property operating segment is engaged in the innovation, development and monetization of intellectual property. Our portfolio consists of over 600 patents and patent applications covering telecom infrastructure, internet search, ad-insertion and mobile technologies; it includes the following key categories:

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; Wireless Infrastructure and Devices &#8211; This portfolio encompasses technologies relating to telecom infrastructure, including communication management, data and signal transmission, mobility management, radio resources management and services. Declarations were filed by Nokia, the portfolio&#8217;s predecessor-in-title, with various standard setting organizations, that a number of patent families may be essential to wireless communication standards. Currently, we believe that 28 of the 124 acquired patent families are actually essential. &#160;

&#8226; Content Distribution &#8211; In 2012, we purchased a portfolio of patents invented by Tayo Akadiri relating to content distribution. The portfolio includes seven patents as well as several pending patent applications. As one of the means of realizing the value of these patents, on October 20, 2015, we filed suit against DirecTV in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. &#160;

&#8226; We also filed over 60 internally developed patents and patent applications, in the areas of cognitive radio, wireless energy, video group messaging, behavioral modification and mobile phone security. &#160;

We are currently focused on identifying, generating, acquiring and deriving economic benefits from intellectual property assets and we monetize our technology portfolio through a variety of value enhancing initiatives, including, but not limited to licensing, litigation and strategic partnerships. For further information regarding our intellectual property enforcement activities, refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160; 

Fli Charge 

&#160; 

Fli Charge is a wire-free power company dedicated to making it easier for people to power and charge the multitude of mobile electronic devices they use on a daily basis. By eliminating the need to search and compete for outlets and charging cables, we are improving the powering and charging experience for all battery and DC powered devices.

&#160;

Fli Charge designs, develops, licenses, manufactures and markets wire-free conductive power and charging solutions. Fli Charge is currently working with partners in several verticals to bring products to market. These verticals include education, office, hospitality, automotive and consumer electronics among others. To date, we have not yet generated any substantial revenue from our products. We believe that Fli Charge&#8217;s patented technology is the only wire-free power solution that is fully interoperable between different mobile devices ranging from smartphones to power tools, and many more. Fli Charge&#8217;s wire-free power solution can simultaneously power multiple devices on the same pad no matter their power requirements or positions on the pad.

&#160;

The Fli Charge ecosystem consists of power pads or surfaces as well as devices that are connected to or embedded with Fli Charge enabling technology. Fli Charge pads and surfaces are connected to a power source or battery. The surface of the pad has conductive contact strips that provide power and are constantly monitored by control circuitry that immediately halts power transfer if an unapproved load or short-circuit condition is detected. Fli Charge-enabled devices are embedded with the Fli Charge contact enablement that consists of four contact points, known as the Fli Charge &#8220;constellation.&#8221; The constellation is designed to make an immediate and continuous electrical connection with the contact strips regardless of the device&#8217;s orientation on the pad. The enablement monitors the power coming from the pad and ensures that the correct amount of power goes to the device. Once an approved Fli Charge device is placed on a pad, power is transferred immediately to charge or power the device.

&#160;

There are several competing wire-free charging technologies on the market or under development today. The most popular competing technology is inductive wireless charging in which magnetic induction uses a magnetic coil to create resonance, which can transmit energy over a relatively short distance. The amount of power delivered is a function of the size of the coils, and the coils must be aligned and paired within a typical distance of less than one inch. Products utilizing magnetic induction have been available for 10+ years in products such as rechargeable electronic toothbrushes and pace makers. The leading inductive technologies deliver a maximum of 10-15 watts. Other competing technologies include magnetic resonance, RF harvesting, laser and ultrasound.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

As compared to each of the competing wire-free technologies above, we believe that our conductive technology exhibits many competitive advantages including:

&#160;

&#8226; charge rates/efficiency &#8211; Fli Charge pads charge devices nearly as fast as plugging them into a wall outlet;

&#160;

&#8226;

multiple devices &#8211; Fli Charge pads can charge or power multiple devices at the same time without reducing the charging speed;

&#160;

&#8226;

safety &#8211; Fli Charge&#8217;s technology is as safe as plugging devices into a wall outlet;

&#160;

&#8226;

maximum power &#8211; Fli Charge pads can supply as much as 150 watts of power, which is enough to charge or power devices with relatively high power requirements such as power tool batteries and flat screen monitors;

&#160;

&#8226;

positioning freedom &#8211; Fli Charge&#8217;s technology allows for devices to be placed in any orientation, anywhere on the pad, without sacrificing any charging speed; and

&#160;

&#8226;

compatibility &#8211; all Fli Charge enabled electronic devices are compatible with all Fli Charge pads.

&#160;

Group Mobile 

&#160; 

Group Mobile is a provider of rugged, mobile and field-use computing products, serving customers worldwide. Group Mobile provides total hardware solutions, carrying rugged laptops, tablets, and handheld computers. Group Mobile also carries rugged mobile printers, vehicle computer docking and mounting gear, power accessories, wireless communication products, antennas, carrying cases, and all the peripherals, accessories, and add-ons needed to maximize productivity in a mobile- or field-computing environment. Group Mobile operates a full-service ecommerce website with live chat, up-to-date product information, and computer system configuration capabilities.

&#160;

Group Mobile purchases rugged mobile computing equipment and complementary products from its primary distribution and manufacturing partners and sells them to enterprise, reseller, and retail customers. Our primary customers range from corporations to local governments, emergency first responders and healthcare organizations. We believe that Group Mobile&#8217;s business is characterized by gross profits as a percentage of revenue slightly higher than is commonly found in resellers of computing devices. The market for rugged mobile computing products is trending towards an increase in the volume of unit sales combined with declining unit prices as the business transitions from primarily being comprised of laptops to one primarily comprised of rugged tablets. As this transition has occurred, Group Mobile is seeing shortened product life cycles and industry specific devices for segments such as healthcare. Group Mobile sets sale prices based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product. Group Mobile is highly dependent on the end-market demand for rugged mobile computing products, which is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new IT products by OEM, replacement cycles for existing rugged mobile computing products, overall economic growth, local and state budgets, and general business activity.

&#160;

Product costs represent the single largest expense and product inventory is one of the largest working capital investments for Group Mobile. Group Mobile&#8217;s primary suppliers include Synnex Corporation, Ingram Micro Inc., Xplore Technologies Corporation and Flextronics International Ltd., which combined represent approximately 80% of Group Mobile&#8217;s inventory purchases. We have reseller agreements with most of our OEM and distribution partners. These agreements usually provide for nonexclusive resale and distribution rights. The agreements are generally short-term, subject to periodic renewal, and often contain provisions permitting termination by either our supplier or us without cause upon relatively short notice. Furthermore, product procurement from the OEM suppliers is a highly complex process and as such, efficient and effective purchasing operations are critical to Group Mobile&#8217;s success.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Our strategy for our Intellectual Property operating segment is to continue to monetize our existing portfolio of intellectual property through licensing and strategic partnerships. In addition, we plan to continue to enhance our intellectual property rights around our Fli Charge technology and products. Fli Charge plans to strengthen and develop partnerships in numerous markets, including automotive, education, office, healthcare, power tools and vaporizers. We believe that growth in Group Mobile&#8217;s revenue can be achieved by adding new products, by exploring new distribution verticals, such as military and government, and by increasing the sales team&#8217;s geographic coverage. 

&#160; &#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160;

ZTE Agreement 

&#160;

On December 7, 2015, we entered into a confidential settlement and license agreement (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) with ZTE Corporation and its affiliates (&#8220;ZTE&#8221;), pursuant to which: (i) ZTE paid us a total of $21,500,000 net of any withholding, value added or other taxes; (ii) the parties withdrew all pending litigations and proceedings against each other including the litigations related to ZTE&#8217;s breach of its non-disclosure agreement with Vringo; and (iii) we granted ZTE a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide perpetual license of certain of our owned patents and patent applications.

&#160;

Acquisition 

&#160; 

On October 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of IDG. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of IDG, including two of IDG&#8217;s subsidiaries, Fli Charge, in which IDG owned 70% of the capital stock and controls the operations, and the wholly-owned Group Mobile.

&#160;

As consideration for the acquisition, we issued an equivalent of 1,666,667 common shares (after giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse stock split), which were issued as follows: (i) 1,604,167 shares of our newly designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (&#8220;Series B Preferred&#8221;), convertible into 1,604,167 shares of our common stock , (ii) 57,500 shares of our unregistered common stock issued to one of the sellers, who is a former Chief Executive Officer and Director, in consideration of his forgiveness of debt and (iii) 5,000 shares of our common stock for transaction related services.

&#160;

A total of 240,625 Series B Preferred shares were placed in escrow to secure certain of the sellers&#8217; indemnity obligations under the Purchase Agreement for a period of up to 12 months.

&#160;

On November 27, 2015 and pursuant to its terms, all Series B Preferred outstanding shares were converted into our unregistered shares of common stock, resulting in the issuance of the 1,604,167 shares of common stock.

&#160;

Purchase consideration value was determined based on the market value of our shares of common stock at the date of the transactions, discounted for the fact that the shares are restricted as to their marketability for a period of six months from the issuance date. Total purchase value of consideration of the acquisition was valued at $5,571,000.

&#160;

On December 28, 2015, we acquired the remaining 30% interest in Fli Charge from third parties. In conjunction with the transaction, we issued 110,000 shares of our unregistered common stock for total consideration valued at $262,000. The value of the consideration for financial reporting purposes was determined based on the market value of our shares at the date of the transaction, discounted due to the restricted nature of the shares and the effect this has on their marketability.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Notes Financing 

&#160;

On May 4, 2015 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;), we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional investors in a registered direct offering of $12,500,000 of Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) and warrants to purchase 537,500 shares of our common stock (after giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse stock split) . On the Closing Date, we issued the Notes, which are convertible into shares of our common stock at $10.00 per share, bear 8% interest and mature in 21 months from the date of issuance, unless earlier converted. In addition, we issued 537,500 warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, which are exercisable at $10.00 per share for a period of five years, beginning on November 4, 2015. In connection with the issuance of the Notes and the warrants, we received net cash proceeds of $12,425,000. We also incurred third party costs directly associated with the issuance of Notes of $218,000, which are capitalized as debt issuance costs and included in other current assets, and are amortized over the term of the Note. Our obligations under the outstanding Notes are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our U.S. assets. In addition, stock of our certain subsidiaries was pledged. The outstanding Notes contain customary events of default, as well as covenants which include restrictions on our assumption of new debt. As of December 31, 2015, all covenants were met and there were no events of default.

&#160;

The principal amount of the outstanding Notes is being repaid monthly, and we may make such payments and related interest payments in cash or, subject to certain conditions, in registered shares of our common stock, at our election. If we choose to repay the Notes in shares of our common stock, the shares are issued at a 15% discount, based on the then-current market price data of our common stock. We may also repay the Notes in advance of the maturity schedule subject to early repayment penalties.

&#160;

During August 2015, the holders of the Notes accelerated six principal installments in exchange for common stock as permitted under the securities purchase agreement. The Notes are now expected to mature in July 2016.

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made principal payments in the aggregate amount of $8,294,000. We elected to make a total of $595,000 of these principal payments in cash and the remaining $7,699,000 in shares of our common stock, which were issued at a 15% discount to the then current market price. As such, we issued approximately 2,070,000 shares (after giving effect to the one-for-ten reverse stock split) in lieu of principal payments for the year ended December 31, 2015, and recorded $1,373,000 extinguishment of debt expense on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Reverse Stock Split 

&#160; 

On November 27, 2015, we implemented a one-for-ten reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the &#34;Reverse Stock Split&#34;), as authorized at a special meeting of our stockholders held on November 16, 2015. The Reverse Stock Split became effective at the opening of trading on the NASDAQ on November 27, 2015. As of November 27, 2015, every 10 shares of our issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one share of our common stock, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in any of our stockholders owning a fractional share, which was rounded up to the next highest whole share. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, there was no change in the nominal par value per share of $0.01.

&#160;

All references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to number of shares of common stock, price per share and weighted average shares of common stock have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split on a retroactive basis for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

NASDAQ 

&#160;

On December 18, 2014, we received a notification letter from NASDAQ informing us that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our securities had closed below $1.00 per share. On June 17, 2015, we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying us that we had been granted an additional 180-day period, or until December 14, 2015, to regain compliance with the minimum $1.00 bid price per share requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(ii). On December 14, 2015, as a result of the Reverse Stock Split on November 27, 2015, we received a letter from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC notifying us that we regained compliance with The NASDAQ Stock Market's minimum bid price continued listing requirement. The letter noted that because the closing bid price of our common stock has been at $1.00 per share or greater for the last 10 consecutive trading days, we have regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and the matter is now closed. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Each of our three reporting segments operates in different competitive environments.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

After a period of intense competition from public and private companies for the acquisition of intellectual property assets, prices have dropped substantially. Due to the many patent sales and divestments over the past few years, many companies continue to seek to monetize intellectual property by licensing their patents to companies in a number of technology sectors. This has occurred in an increasingly challenging and changing legal environment for monetizing patents. Relatively new procedures at the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as the anticipation of the Unified European Patent Court have created uncertainty as to the value of patent assets. In addition, many of these intellectual property-focused companies incurred significant up-front costs, are faced with significant operating expenses, and/or undertook large amounts of debt. Entities such as VirnetX (NYSE:VHC), Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG), Interdigital, Inc. (NASDAQ:IDCC), RPX Corporation (NASDAQ:RPXC), Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA) and others presently market themselves as being in the business of creating, acquiring, licensing or leveraging the value of intellectual property assets.

&#160;

Fli Charge 

&#160;

There are several competing wire-free charging technologies on the market or under development today. The most popular competing technology is inductive wireless charging in which magnetic induction uses a magnetic coil to create resonance, which can transmit energy over very short distances. Power is delivered as a function of coil size, and coils must be directly paired within a typical distance of less than one inch. Products utilizing magnetic induction have been available for 10+ years in products such as rechargeable electronic toothbrushes and pace makers. Other competing technologies include magnetic resonance, RF harvesting, laser and ultrasound. Most competitors utilize these competing technologies and not our technology.

&#160;

Group Mobile 

&#160;

Our rugged devices reselling business is regionally focused with the majority of our customers having direct relationships with local sales staff. Most competitors are private companies that have limited infrastructure. We believe that our key competitive advantages are knowledge, service and breadth of product relative to these competitors. As we restructure the business, we also believe that we will be able to further improve our service and overall shopping experience.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 10, 2016, we have 24 full-time and 3 part-time employees. We do not have employees that are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.

&#160;

Our Company 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Delaware as a corporation on January 9, 2006 and completed an initial public offering in June 2010.
