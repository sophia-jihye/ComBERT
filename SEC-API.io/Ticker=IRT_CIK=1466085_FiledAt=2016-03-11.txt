 ITEM 1. 

Business 

&#160;

Our Company 

&#160;

We are a Maryland corporation that owns apartment properties in geographic non-gateway markets that we believe support strong occupancy and have the potential for growth in rental rates. We seek to provide stockholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns, with an emphasis on distributions and capital appreciation. We are externally advised by a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAIT Financial Trust, or RAIT (NYSE: RAS), a multi-strategy commercial real estate company organized as an internally managed REIT. RAIT invests in commercial mortgage loans and commercial real estate. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011. 

&#160;

We seek to acquire and operate apartment properties that: 

&#160;

&#183; 

have stable occupancy; 

&#160;

&#183; 

are located in non-gateway markets that we do not expect will experience substantial new apartment construction in the foreseeable future; 

&#160;

&#183; 

in appropriate circumstances, present opportunities for repositioning or updating through capital expenditures; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

present opportunities to apply tailored marketing and management strategies to attract and retain residents and enable rent increases. 

&#160;

Our Business Objective and Investment Strategies 

&#160;

Our primary business objective is to maximize stockholder value by increasing cash flows at our existing apartment properties and acquiring additional properties that have strong and stable occupancies with the ability to raise rental rates or that have the potential for repositioning through capital expenditures or tailored management strategies. We intend to achieve this objective by executing the following strategies: 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Use our external advisor&#8217;s extensive experience lending to, owning and/or managing apartment properties, and its networks of contacts in the apartment industry, to acquire additional apartment properties. RAIT&#8217;s property management subsidiary which does business as RAIT Residential, manages approximately 20,000 apartment units in 25 states (including those owned by us). We believe these factors and our external advisor&#8217;s commercial real estate relationships and access to off-market transactions, including relationships with the brokerage community, will continue to provide us with a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Focus on properties in markets that have strong apartment demand, reduced competition from national apartment buyers and no substantial new apartment construction. In evaluating potential acquisitions, our advisor analyzes apartment occupancy and trends in rental rates, employment and new construction, among many other factors, and seeks to identify properties located primarily in non-gateway markets where there is strong demand for apartment units, little to no apartment development, stable resident bases and occupancy rates, positive net migration trends and strong employment drivers. We generally will seek to avoid markets where we believe potential yields have decreased as a result of the acquisition and development efforts of large institutional buyers. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Acquire properties that have operating upside through targeted management strategies. Both we and our advisor have expertise in acquiring and/or managing properties and maximizing the net operating income, or NOI, of such properties through more effective marketing and leasing, better management of rental rates and more efficient expense management. We will seek to acquire properties that we believe possess significant prospects for increased occupancy and rental revenue growth. Our target profile for acquisitions currently is midrise/garden-style apartments containing 150-500 units with good amenities that we can acquire at less than replacement cost in the $15 million to $50 million price range with a five to fifteen year operating track record. We do not intend to limit ourselves to properties in this target profile, however, and may make acquisitions outside of this profile or change our target profile whenever market conditions warrant. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Selectively use our capital to improve apartment properties where we believe the return on such investments is accretive to our stockholders. We have significant experience allocating capital to value-added improvements of apartment properties to produce better occupancy and rental rates. We will selectively deploy our capital into revenue- 

&#160;

&#160;

enhancing capital projects that we and our advisor believe will improve the physical plant or market positioning of particular apartment pro perties and generate increased income over time. &#160;

&#160;

2015 Developments 

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we focused on our acquisition of Trade Street Residential, Inc. described below and absorbing the growth we experienced. We refer to Trade Street Residential, Inc. as TSRE and to our acquisition of TSRE as the TSRE acquisition. We added 20 properties with 5,225 units, in the aggregate, to our portfolio in 2015, primarily as a result of the TSRE acquisition, which we completed in September 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.4 billion of gross investments in real estate, and $1.0 billion of debt, with a weighted average effective interest cost of 3.7%. As of December 31, 2015, we own 49 apartment properties containing an aggregate of 13,724 apartment units. We refer to these apartment properties as our &#8220;existing portfolio.&#8221; As of December 31, 2015, our existing portfolio had an average occupancy of 93.6% and an average monthly effective rent per occupied apartment unit of $951. As of December 31, 2015, o ur existing portfolio consists primarily of apartment communities geographically concentrated in the Southeastern United States.

&#160;

Property Acquisitions

&#160;

-Acquisition of Trade Street Residential, Inc. 

&#160;

On September 17, 2015, we completed the TSRE acquisition pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the TSRE acquisition agreement described below. We believe we have been able to integrate TSRE into our operations to date with minimal disruptions and expect this integration to continue. We believe the TSRE acquisition provided us with significant benefits, including:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Enhanced Scale. We believe our increased size resulting from the TSRE acquisition provides an enhanced platform to pursue accretive acquisitions and transformational opportunities. The TSRE acquisition increased our number of units by 55%. The TSRE acquisition has resulted in an increase in our market capitalization from the period prior to the TSRE acquisition and we expect this increase to continue, which should improve stockholder liquidity. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Improved portfolio quality. We believe the portfolio of properties we acquired in the TSRE acquisition, or the TSRE portfolio, was among the newest property portfolios held by publicly traded REITs focused on owning apartments with an average property age of 11 years. We expect the TSRE portfolio will increase our operating efficiency because we believe the TSRE portfolio had a higher NOI margin than our existing portfolio prior to the TSRE acquisition. The TSRE acquisition improves the quality of our existing portfolio by increasing the percentage of properties we characterize as class A and improves average base rents. We expect additional benefits from the TSRE portfolio&#8217;s level of leasing activity and capacity for increased rents upon re-leasing. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Accelerates market penetration. The TSRE acquisition has accelerated our regional market expansion strategy and we expect this acceleration to continue. The TSRE portfolio provides enhanced geographic diversity within targeted regions, exposure to eight new quality markets and increased presence in three existing markets. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Expected immediate financial benefit. We expect the operating results of the TSRE portfolio to be accretive to 2016 core funds from operations, or core FFO, per share, based on cost savings we expect to achieve and potential increases to NOI we expect will result from capital expenditures with respect to value-add properties that were in the TSRE portfolio. We refer to properties as value-add properties when they are in various phases of development, redevelopment or repositioning and where we believe that, through limited capital expenditures, we can achieve enhanced returns. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the merger agreement relating to the TSRE acquisition, or the TSRE merger agreement, on September 17, 2015, each outstanding share of common stock of TSRE was converted automatically into the right to receive (a) $3.80 in cash and (b) 0.4108 shares of our common stock, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. As a result, we paid approximately $139.8 million in cash as cash consideration and issued approximately 15.1 million shares of our common stock as equity consideration in the TSRE acquisition. Immediately prior to the TSRE acquisition, the sole third party holder of common units, or TSR OP units, issued by Trade Street Operating Partnership, LP, the operating partnership of TSRE, or TSR OP, contributed all of their TSR OP units to IROP in exchange for approximately 1.9 million common units, or IROP units, issued by IROP. On a fully diluted basis (assuming the exchange of the IROP units for the equivalent number of shares of our common stock) following the closing of the TSRE acquisition, legacy IRT stockholders owned approximately 68% of the combined company, and former TSRE stockholders owned approximately 32% of the combined company. These issuances occurred in connection with the following mergers contemplated by the TSRE merger agreement: (i) Adventure Merger Sub LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IROP, or OP Merger Sub, merged with and into TSR OP, with TSR OP continuing as the surviving entity, and (ii) TSRE merged with and into IRT Limited Partner, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IRT, or IRT LP LLC, with IRT LP LLC continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of 

&#160;

IRT. Any assets acquired by IRT LP LLC in this merger were subsequently contributed to IROP. For further description of the financial impact of the TSRE acqui sition on us, see &#8220; Part II- Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Note 3: TSRE Merger&#8221; below, or the financial statements TSRE merger note. Our financing of the TSRE acquisition is discussed below, see &#8220;Financing Strategy.&#8221; 

&#160;

-Indianapolis Acquisition

&#160;

In May 2015, we acquired an apartment community located in Indianapolis, Indiana for a purchase price of approximately $25.3 million. 

&#160;

Property Dispositions

&#160;

In December 2015, we sold a 320 unit apartment property located in Tucson, Arizona for $33.6 million. We received net cash proceeds of approximately $14.1 million, after transaction costs and full repayment of the debt underlying the property. In February 2016, we sold a 222 unit apartment property located in Smyrna, Georgia for $18.0 million. We received net cash proceeds of approximately $9.7 million, after transaction costs and full repayment of the debt underlying the property. As discussed in &#8220;Financing Strategy&#8221; below, we used the net cash proceeds primarily to reduce our outstanding indebtedness. These property sales were part of our capital recycling strategy described below in &#8220;Financing Strategy&#8221; to sell properties which we believe have limited potential for further improvements to their operating results and/or fall outside our geographic focus. 

&#160;

In October 2015, we sold a parcel of land acquired in the TSRE acquisition for $3.4 million. 

&#160;

Financing Strategy

&#160;

We intend to use prudent amounts of leverage in making our investments, which we historically defined as having total indebtedness of no more than approximately 65% of the combined initial purchase price of all of the properties in our portfolio. However, the amount of leverage we use may be significantly less or greater than we currently anticipate, subject to compliance with leverage restrictions in our indebtedness. We determined that the strategic long term benefits of the TSRE acquisition justified exceeding our historical leverage limits. In connection with the TSRE acquisition, we entered into the KeyBank senior facility described below, the KeyBank interim facility described below, refinanced or assumed mortgages secured by TSRE properties and paid off our secured credit facility, or the HNB facility, with The Huntington National Bank . Our leverage rose to 68.1% at December 31, 2015 from 58.4% at December 31, 2014. For further description of our indebtedness at December 31, 2015, see &#8220;Part II-Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5: Indebtedness&#8221; below, or the financial statements indebtedness note. We have implemented a strategy described below that seeks to prudently recycle our capital to reduce our leverage levels over time.

&#160;

Simultaneously with the closing of the TSRE acquisition, IROP entered into a $325.0 million senior secured credit facility, or the KeyBank senior facility, with KeyBank, N.A., or KeyBank. The KeyBank senior facility consists of a revolving line of credit in an amount of up to $125.0 million, or the revolver, and a term loan in an amount of no less than $200.0 million, or the term loan. Up to 10% of the revolver is available for &#8220;swingline&#8221; loans, and up to 10% of the revolver is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, IROP has the right to request an increase the aggregate amount of the KeyBank senior facility to up to $450.0 million. The KeyBank senior facility will mature on September 17, 2018, three years from its closing date, subject to the option of IROP to extend the KeyBank senior facility for two additional 12-month periods upon IROP giving defined notice, no defaults or events of default thereunder existing or continuing, all IROP&#8217;s representations made therein being true in all material respects and the payment of an extension fee. As of December 31, 2015, there was $53.5 million of availability under the revolver and $0 of availability under the term loan. For further description of the KeyBank Senior Facility, see the financial statements indebtedness note. 

&#160; 

Simultaneously with the closing of the TSRE acquisition, we entered into a credit agreement with respect to a $120.0 million interim term loan facility, or the KeyBank interim facility. The KeyBank interim facility is structured as a 364-day secured term loan facility (with a maturity extension option for an additional six months upon IROP giving defined notice, no defaults or events of default thereunder existing or continuing, the principal amount of the KeyBank interim facility being reduced to no greater than $75.0 million and the payment of an extension fee ) available in a single draw. IROP may prepay the KeyBank interim facility, in whole or in part, at any time without fee or penalty (other than as provided in a separate fee letter with the lenders), except for breakage costs associated with London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, borrowings. IROP is required to reduce the principal amount outstanding under the KeyBank interim facility to no greater than $100.0 million within six months of closing of the facility and must apply 100% of all net proceeds from equity issuances, sales of assets, or refinancing of assets towards repaying the KeyBank interim facility. At December 31, 2015, there was $0 of availability under the KeyBank interim facility. For further description of the KeyBank interim facility, see the financial statements indebtedness note. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Following the completion of the TSRE acquisition, we have instituted a strategy, which we refer to as our capital recycling strategy, seeking to reduce IRT&#8217;s leverage ratio over time by using the proceeds from sales of properties which are outside our core geographic footprint in the Southeast ern United States or which we believe we have limited potential for further improvements to thei r operating results to repay a portion of our indebtedness. We began to implement this strategy in December 2015 by selling one property in Arizona and , in February 2016, selling a second property in Georgia. We have also entered into agreements to sell a third property in Arizona and a fourth property in Colorado . We have used the net proceeds of the properties we sold and expect to use the proceeds of these anticipated sales to reduce the outstanding balance of the KeyBank interim facility. Additional ly, the mortgage debt on five of our properties is maturing in April 2016 giving us the flexibility to sell or refinance these properties . We intend to use net proceeds from any sales or refinancing of these properties to further reduce the KeyBank interi m facility. 

&#160;

In general, however, by operating on a leveraged basis, we expect to have more funds available for property acquisitions and other purposes, which we believe will allow us to acquire more properties than would otherwise be possible, resulting in a larger and more diversified portfolio. See &#8220;Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Associated with Debt Financing&#8221; below for more information about the risks related to operating on a leveraged basis. 

&#160;

If our board of directors changes our policies regarding our use of leverage, we expect that it will consider many factors, including, among others, the lending standards of government-sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, for loans in connection with the financing of apartment properties, the leverage ratios of publicly traded REITs with similar investment strategies, the cost of leverage as compared to expected operating net revenues and general market conditions. 

&#160;

Development and Structure of Our Company 

&#160;

We were formed as a Maryland corporation on March 26, 2009. RAIT acquired beneficial ownership of 100% of our outstanding common stock on January 20, 2011 for approximately $2.5 million and we commenced operations on April 29, 2011 upon our acquisition of six properties from RAIT. Since our formation, we have sold 26,448,300 shares of our common stock in four underwritten public offerings raising $238.4 million of gross proceeds. While RAIT has bought shares in several of these offerings and remains our largest single stockholder, RAIT&#8217;s ownership percentage has reduced after each offering. As of December 31, 2015 and March 9, 2016, RAIT owned 15.5% and 15.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, respectively. 

&#160;

We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, structure in which our properties are owned by our operating partnership, IROP, directly or through subsidiaries. We are the sole general partner of IROP. IROP was formed as a Delaware limited partnership on March 27, 2009. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and substantially all of our operations are conducted through, our operating partnership. As the sole general partner of our operating partnership, we have the exclusive power under the partnership agreement to manage and conduct its business. Since IROP&#8217;s formation, IROP has issued 3,207,868 IROP units to unaffiliated third parties as part of the consideration to acquire 23 properties in five transactions, including 1,925,419 IROP units issued in connection with the TSRE acquisition. These IROP units are exchangeable for the equivalent number of shares of common stock or the equivalent value in cash, at our option, in defined circumstances. From IROP&#8217;s formation through December 31, 2015, 52,937 IROP units held by unaffiliated third parties have been exchanged for 52,933 shares of our common stock with fractional units being settled in cash. From December 31, 2015 through March 9, 2016, 204,115 IROP units held by unaffiliated third parties have been exchanged for 204,113 shares of our common stock with fractional shares being settled in cash. As of December 31, 2015 and March 9, 2016, 3,154,931 and 2,950,816 IROP units held by unaffiliated third parties were outstanding. We refer to these transactions as UPREIT transactions. Limited partners have certain limited approval and voting rights. 

&#160; 

We are externally advised by our advisor pursuant to an advisory agreement and subject to the oversight of our board of directors. Our advisor, a RAIT subsidiary, was formed on March 26, 2009 and is responsible for managing our day-to-day business operations and identifying properties for us to acquire. We pay our advisor and its affiliates fees and reimburse them for expenses in connection with their services to us. We do not have any employees. The items of compensation and reimbursement are outlined below in Item 8-&#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8212;Note 7. Related Party Transactions and Arrangements.&#8221; 

&#160;

RAIT Residential, our property manager, was formed on April 9, 2009 as an indirect subsidiary of Jupiter Realty Corporation, a Chicago-based residential and commercial real estate firm established in 1985. In May 2009, RAIT acquired a 75% controlling equity interest in our property manager. In July 2015, RAIT acquired the remaining 25% of its equity, making it RAIT&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary. Our property manager is a full-service apartment property management company that, as of December 31, 2015, employs approximately 500 staff and professionals and manages approximately 20,000 apartment units, including 13,724 units owned by us. Our property manager provides services to us in connection with the rental, leasing, operation and management of our properties. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

&#160;

In attracting and retaini ng residents to occupy our properties, we compete with numerous other housing alternatives. Our properties compete directly with other rental apartments as well as condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent or purchase in the sub-mark ets in which our properties are located. Principal factors of competition include rent or price charged, attractiveness of the location and property and quality and breadth of services and amenities. If our competitors offer leases at rental rates below cu rrent market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants. 

&#160;

The number of competitive properties relative to demand in a particular area has a material effect on our ability to lease apartment units at our properties and on the rents we charge. In certain sub-markets there exists an oversupply of single family homes and condominiums and a reduction of households, both of which affect the pricing and occupancy of our rental apartments. Additionally, we compete with other real estate investors, including other apartment REITs, pension and investment funds, partnerships and investment companies in acquiring, redeveloping and managing apartment properties. This competition affects our ability to acquire properties and the price that we pay for such acquisitions. 

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Our investments are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution, and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 

&#160;

Income Taxes 

&#160;

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2011. Accordingly, we recorded no income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

&#160;

To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and core FFO; however, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify and maintain treatment as a REIT and intend to operate in such a manner so that we will remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. For a discussion of the tax implications of our REIT status to us and our stockholders, see &#8220;Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations&#8221; contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
