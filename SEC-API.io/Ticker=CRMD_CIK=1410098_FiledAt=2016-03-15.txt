Overview 

&#160;

We in-license, develop and commercialize prophylactic and therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases. We have in-licensed the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize our product candidate, CRMD003 (Neutrolin &#174; ), which we believe addresses potentially large market opportunities in the instances in which a central venous catheter is used, such as hemodialysis, intensive care units, oncology and patients receiving total parenteral nutrition, IV hydration, and/or IV medications. 

Neutrolin is an anti-infective solution for the prevention of catheter-related infections and thrombosis in the central venous catheter markets such as dialysis, critical care, and oncology. There are seven million central venous catheters and 160 million peripheral catheters placed per year in patients in the United States (U.S.). There are 250,000 catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) in the United States per year. The mortality rate ranges from 20 to 25%. Neutrolin is a novel formulation of taurolidine, citrate and heparin 1000 u/ml that provides a combination preventative solution to decrease the development of biofilm, which reduces infection and thrombosis thereby keeping catheters operating optimally in the clinical settings in hemodialysis, critical care/intensive care and oncology. There are approximately 468,000 hemodialysis patients in the United States. Hemodialysis using a tunneled central vein catheter was our initial target market with Germany being the first market in which we launched Neutrolin as a medical device in December 2013. These hemodialysis patients represent over 127 million catheter/dialysis treatment days per year in the U.S., which we believe represents a conservative market potential of $300 to $400 million. The market in the critical care/intensive care units is 28.5 million catheter days per year in the United States alone. There were over 14.5 million patients living with cancer in the United States as of 2014 with an estimated 7.7 million having a long-term central venous catheter. However, when stages of disease, chemotherapy regimens and catheter types are factored, the oncology market represents 90 million catheter days. Infection and thrombosis represent key complications among critical care/intensive care and cancer patients with central venous catheters. These complications can lead to treatment delays and increased costs to the healthcare system when they occur due to hospitalizations, need for IV antibiotic treatment, long-term anticoagulation therapy, removal/replacement of the central venous catheter, related treatment costs and increased mortality when they occur. 

International 

In late 2011, we received a notice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA that Neutrolin had been assigned to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, for review as a drug rather than a device. As a result of this, and given our then limited resources, we decided to change our business strategy and focus the majority of our resources on the research and development of Neutrolin, rather than CRMD004 and to seek regulatory and commercialization approval for Neutrolin in Europe through a CE Mark application rather than pursue FDA approval at that time. During the first half of 2011, we submitted our design dossier to T&#220;V S&#220;D, the European notified body managing our CE Mark application. In late 2011, we successfully completed our Stage 1 audit with T&#220;V S&#220;D and we successfully completed the Stage 2 audit in the third quarter of 2012. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On October 10, 2012, we received ISO 13485:2003 certification from T&#220;V S&#220;D. This certification, which is a stand-alone standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization, is the globally recognized standard that outlines consistent international processes for the design and manufacturing of medical devices, including many supply chain functions such as assembly, packaging, warehousing and distribution. Compliance with ISO 13485 is often seen as a step towards achieving compliance with European regulatory requirements. The conformity of medical devices and in-vitro diagnostic medical devices according to applicable EU standards must be assessed before sale is permitted. The preferred method to prove conformity is the certification by a notified body of the quality management system according to ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 and ISO 14971. The result of a positive assessment is the issuance of a Certificate of Conformity allowing the CE Mark and the permission to sell the medical device in the European Union. 

In July 2013, we received CE Mark approval for Neutrolin. As a result, in 2013, we began the commercial launch of Neutrolin in Germany for the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections, or CRBI, and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis patients using a tunneled, cuffed central venous catheter for vascular access. To date, Neutrolin is registered and may be sold in Austria, Germany, Italy, Malta, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and The Netherlands for such treatment. 

We have entered into agreements with a German contract sales company and with a Saudi Arabian company to market and sell Neutrolin for hemodialysis, critical care/intensive care and oncolytic patients in Germany and Saudi Arabia, respectively, and with a South Korean company to market, sell and distribute Neutrolin for hemodialysis, critical care/intensive care and oncolytic patients in that country upon receipt of regulatory approval. We also have independent sales representatives in The Netherlands. 

In December 2014, we received approval from the Hessian District President in Germany to expand the label to include use in oncology patients receiving chemotherapy, IV hydration and IV medications via central venous catheters. The expansion also adds patients receiving medication and IV fluids via central venous catheters in intensive or critical care units (cardiac care unit, surgical care unit, neonatal critical care unit, and urgent care centers). An indication for use in total parenteral, or IV, nutrition was also approved. In September 2014, the TUV-SUD and The Medicinal Evaluation Board of the Netherlands (MEB) granted a label expansion for Neutrolin for these same expanded indications for the E.U. 

United States 

In late 2013, we met with the FDA to determine the pathway for U.S. approval of Neutrolin. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we plan to conduct at least one Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis catheters and one Phase 3 clinical trial in oncology/total parenteral nutrition. We worked with the FDA to design the protocol for a Phase 3 trial in hemodialysis patients with a central venous catheter; this protocol was accepted in August 2014 and we filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, in September 2014. In October 2014, the FDA informed us that it had determined that the IND is not subject to a clinical hold, and that the Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis patients could be initiated in the U.S. 

&#160;

In December 2015, our Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis catheters or Catheter Lock Solution Investigational Trial (&#8220;LOCK-IT-100&#8221;) began with the enrollment and dosing of the first patient. The LOCK-IT-100 trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, active control trial which aims to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Neutrolin in preventing CRBSIs in subjects receiving hemodialysis therapy as treatment for end stage renal disease. The primary endpoint for the trial is freedom from CRBSIs. The trial will evaluate whether Neutrolin is superior to the active control heparin or normal saline control by documenting the incidence of CRBSI and the time until the occurrence of CRBSI. Key secondary endpoints are catheter patency which is defined as required use of tissue plasminogen activating factor (tPA) or removal of catheter due to dysfunction and catheter removal for any reason. An exploratory endpoint of biofilm analysis will be evaluated in the first 200 catheters removed. 

&#160;

The FDA has designated Neutrolin as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for oncology, hemodialysis, and critical care/intensive care patients, where catheter-related blood stream infections and clotting can be life-threatening. The QIDP designation provides an additional five years of market exclusivity in addition to the five years granted for a New Chemical Entity. In addition, in January 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to Neutrolin &#174; Catheter Lock Solution, pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) highlighting the large unmet need to prevent infections in the U.S, healthcare system. Fast Track designation is granted to drug products designed to treat a serious condition, for which clinical data has been generated and shown to potentially address an unmet medical need. The Fast Track designation of Neutrolin provides CorMedix with the opportunity to meet with the FDA on a more frequent basis during the review process, and also ensures an expedited review of any marketing application. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our other product candidate was CRMD004, which is the gel formulation of Neutrolin that was in the pre-clinical stage of development. In November 2015, we terminated the license agreement covering CRMD004 and all rights to CRMD004 reverted to the licensor. 

Corporate History and Information 

&#160;

We were organized as a Delaware corporation on July 28, 2006 under the name &#8220;Picton Holding Company, Inc.&#8221; and we changed our corporate name to &#8220;CorMedix Inc.&#8221; on January 18, 2007. Our operations to date have been primarily limited to licensing product candidates, developing clinical trials for our product candidates, seeking regulatory approvals for Neutrolin, establishing manufacturing for our product candidate, maintaining and improving our patent portfolio and launching Neutrolin in the E.U and other foreign countries. 

Our executive offices are located at 1430 US Highway 206, Suite 200, Bedminster, NJ 07921. Our telephone number is (908) 517-9500. Our website address is www.cormedix.com. Information contained in, or accessible through, our website does not constitute part of this report. 

CRMD003 (Neutrolin) 

Market Opportunity 

Central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters are an important and frequently used method for accessing the vasculature in hemodialysis (a form of dialysis where the patient&#8217;s blood is circulated through a dialysis filter), administering chemotherapy and basic fluids (total parenteral nutrition) in cancer patients and for cancer chemotherapy, long term antibiotic therapy, total parenteral nutrition (complete or partial dietary support via intravenous nutrients) and critical care/intensive care patients. 

Patients undergoing hemodialysis require access to their vascular system in order to perform treatments on a multiple scheduled basis each week. According to the 2015 United States Renal Disease System, there were 468,000 patients on hemodialysis. It has been reported that patients requiring a catheter represent over 127 million catheter/dialysis treatment days per year. In the United States, there were 5.7 million intensive care patients representing 28.5 million catheter days associated with ICU stays alone. As of 2014, there were over 14.5 million patients in the United States living with cancer, with an estimated 7.7 million having had a long-term central venous catheter when stages of disease and types of chemotherapy regime are considered, the number of catheter days are 90 million. Infections and thrombosis represent key complications among cancer patients with central venous catheters. One of the major and common complications for all patients requiring central venous catheters is catheter related blood stream infections, or CRBSIs, and the clinical complications associated with them. There are an estimated 250,000 CRBSIs each year. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated in the Journal of American Medicine, the total annual cost in the United States of treating all CRBI episodes and their complications would amount to approximately $6 billion. 

Biofilm build up is the pathogenesis of both infections and thrombotic complications in central venous catheters. Prevention of CRBIs and inflammatory complications requires both decontamination of the internal surface of the catheter to prevent the systemic dissemination of organisms contained within the biofilm as well as an anticoagulant to retain patency. Biofilm forms when bacteria adhere to surfaces in aqueous environments and begin to excrete a slimy, glue-like substance that can anchor them to various types of materials, including intravenous catheters. The presence of biofilm has many adverse effects, including the ability to release bacteria into the blood stream. The current standard of catheter care is to instill a heparin lock solution at a concentration of 1,000 u/mL into each catheter lumen immediately following treatment, in order to prevent clotting between dialysis treatments. However, a heparin lock solution provides no protection from the risk of infection. 

Currently, there are no pharmacologic agents approved in the U.S. for the prevention of CRBIs in central venous catheters. As noted above, we received the CE Mark approval for Neutrolin from the Medical Evaluation Board, or MEB, at the EU in July 2013. 

We believe there is a significant need for prevention of CRBIs in the hemodialysis patient population as well as for other patient populations utilizing central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters, such as oncology/chemotherapy, total parenteral nutrition and intensive care unit patients. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Neutrolin is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial/antifungal and anticoagulant combination that is active against common microbes including antibiotic-resistant strains and in addition may prevent biofilm formation. We believe that using Neutrolin as an anti-infective solution will significantly reduce the incidence of catheter-related blood stream infections, thus reducing the need for local and systemic antibiotics while prolonging catheter life. 

Development Strategy 

Our strategy is to obtain worldwide approval for Neutrolin. On July 5, 2013, the MEB, which is responsible for authorizing and monitoring safe and effective medicinal products on the Dutch market and shares responsibility for authorizing medicinal products throughout the European Union, issued final approval for the CE Mark certification for Neutrolin. In December 2014, we received approval from the Hessian District President in Germany to expand the label to include use in oncology patients receiving chemotherapy, IV hydration and IV medications via central venous catheters. The expansion also adds patients receiving medication and IV fluids via central venous catheters in intensive or critical care units (cardiac care unit, surgical care unit, neonatal critical care unit, and urgent care centers). An indication for use in total parenteral, or IV, nutrition was also approved. In September 2014, the TUV-SUD and The Medicinal Evaluation Board of the Netherlands (MEB) granted a label expansion for Neutrolin for these same expanded indications for the EU. 

In the U.S., after receipt of the CE Mark, we resumed dialogue with the FDA in November 2013 to determine the pathway for U.S. approval of Neutrolin. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we plan to conduct at least one Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis catheters, one Phase 3 clinical trial in oncology/total parenteral nutrition and a Phase 4 clinical trial in ICU-critical care. We have worked with the FDA to design the protocol for the Phase 3 trial in hemodialysis patients with a central venous catheter; this protocol was accepted in August 2014 and we filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, in September 2014. In October 2014, the FDA informed us that it had determined that the IND is not subject to a clinical hold, and that the Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis patients could be initiated in the U.S. The Phase 3 clinical trial in hemodialysis catheters began in December 2015. We are seeking one or more strategic partners or other sources of capital to complete the development of Neutrolin in the U.S. for hemodialysis catheters, oncology/total parenteral nutrition and ICU-critical care. 

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

After CE Mark approval, we launched Neutrolin &#160; for the prevention of CRBI and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis patients in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2013. T o lead the commercialization of Neutrolin in the European Union, we formed a European subsidiary, CorMedix Europe GmbH. We have entered into agreements with a German contract sales company and with a Saudi Arabian company to market and sell Neutrolin for hemodialysis and oncolytic patients in Germany and Saudi Arabia, respectively, and with a South Korean company to market, sell and distribute Neutrolin for hemodialysis and oncolytic patients in that country upon receipt of regulatory approval. We also have independent sales representatives in The Netherlands. 

We are seeking FDA approval to market our product Neutrolin&#174; in the United States, which will require the successful completion of clinical studies and the submission of a new drug application (NDA) as the agency has informed us that they will regulate the product as a drug, rather than as a device, in this country. As part of the approval process, we intend to seek product labeling that would authorize the use of Neutrolin for the prevention of CRBIs and the maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis and oncology/total parenteral nutrition patients, and we intend to launch the product and make it commercially available throughout the United States within six months following FDA approval. 

Initially, we expect to sell the product directly to hospitals and also to key dialysis center operators. We anticipate that Medicare reimbursement could be available for Neutrolin in other catheter indications in intensive care, oncology and total parenteral nutrition through relevant hospital inpatient diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) or outpatient ambulatory payment classifications (APCs), the End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System (ESRD PPS) base payment, or under the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Fee Schedule, depending on the setting of care. We also plan to seek separate reimbursement as a drug, where available under Medicare, through mechanisms such as pass-through status under the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, the transitional drug add-on payment adjustment under the ESRD PPS, or reimbursement as a drug used with a DME infusion pump. We cannot fully anticipate changes in reimbursement requirements and mechanisms in the coming years, however, and we cannot be certain that Neutrolin will be granted separate reimbursement under any of these mechanisms. 

Furthermore, we anticipate that the U.S. Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS), and private payers will increasingly demand that manufacturers demonstrate the cost effectiveness of their product as part of the reimbursement review and approval process. With this in mind, we have incorporated health economic evaluations into our ongoing clinical studies to support this review in the context of the prospective use of Neutrolin in dialysis, the ICU and oncology settings. Our studies might not be sufficient to support coverage or reimbursement at levels that allow providers to use Neutrolin. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are aiming to develop Neutrolin for indications for prevention of catheter-related blood stream infections associated with any chronic central venous catheter and peripherally inserted central catheter use, such as cancer chemotherapy, intensive care and total parenteral nutrition. In December 2014, we received approval from the Hessian District President in Germany to expand the label to include use in oncology patients receiving chemotherapy, IV hydration and IV medications via central venous catheters. The expansion also adds patients receiving medication and IV fluids via central venous catheters in intensive or critical care units (cardiac care unit, surgical care unit, neonatal critical care unit, and urgent care centers). An indication for use in total parenteral, or IV, nutrition was also approved. In September 2014, the TUV-SUD and The Medicinal Evaluation Board of the Netherlands (MEB) granted a label expansion for Neutrolin for these same expanded indications for the E.U.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Some device companies have launched antibiotic or antimicrobial-coated catheters as short-term prevention of catheter infection. These are not effective for hemodialysis catheters due to the long term use and high blood flow associated with hemodialysis. 

Manufacturing 

All of our manufacturing processes currently are, and we expect them to continue to be, outsourced to third parties. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of drug product for use both commercially and in clinical trials. We intend to continue this practice in the future. 

On April 9, 2015, we announced a program aimed at reducing the cost of goods of Neutrolin through a more efficient, custom synthesis of the active ingredient taurolidine. As part of that program, on April 8, 2015, we entered into a Preliminary Services Agreement with [RC] 2 Pharma Connect LLC (&#8220;RC2&#8221;), pursuant to which RC2 will coordinate certain manufacturing services related to taurolidine, which is a key ingredient in Neutrolin. Specifically, RC2 will undertake a critical parameters evaluation for our manufacturing needs and coordinate the cGMP processes set forth in the agreement that we believe are necessary for the submission of our planned new drug application for Neutrolin to the FDA, as well as any foreign regulatory applications. The total cost for RC2&#8217;s services under the preliminary services agreement is approximately $1.7 million which is expected to be incurred under the terms of this agreement through the second quarter of 2016. Through December 31, 2015, RC2 completed and we recognized expense of approximately $227,000 for its services related to this agreement. 

We are also working with RC2 under several service agreements for the manufacture of clinical supplies to support our ongoing and planned Phase 3 clinical trials for an aggregate amount of $2 million. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized research and development expense of approximately $1,348,000 related to these agreements. We may terminate these agreements upon 30 days written notice and are only obligated for project costs and reasonable project shut down costs provided through the date of termination. 

Navinta LLC, a U.S.-based active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, developer, provides API manufacturing (manufactured in India at an FDA-compliant facility) and a Drug Master File for CRMD003, pursuant to a supply agreement dated December 7, 2009 (the &#8220;Navinta Agreement&#8221;). On March 24, 2015, we and Navinta LLC entered into an amendment to the Navinta Agreement to extend the term of the Navinta Agreement to March 31, 2016 and to lower the price per kilogram of API that we purchase from Navinta LLC under the Navinta Agreement. We also agreed to purchase a minimum amount of product from Navinta LLC during 2015, which replaced the prior minimum purchase requirement. The Navinta Agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice. The Navinta Agreement is set to expire in accordance with its terms upon the delivery of API in early April of 2016. 

We are confident that there exist a sufficient number of potential alternate sources for the drug substances required to produce our products, as well as third-party manufacturers, that we will be able to find alternate suppliers and third-party manufacturers in the event that our relationship with any supplier or third-party manufacturer deteriorates. 

United States Government Regulation 

The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, and marketing, among other things, of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Our products may be classified by the FDA as a drug or a medical device depending upon the indications for use or claims. Because certain of our product candidates are considered as medical devices and others are considered as drugs for regulatory purposes, we intend to submit applications to regulatory agencies for approval or clearance of both medical devices and pharmaceutical product candidates. 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the agency&#8217;s implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, and the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Drug Approval Process 

The research, development, and approval process in the United States and elsewhere is intensive and rigorous and generally takes many years to complete. The typical process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug may be marketed in the United States includes: 

&#9679; 

preclinical laboratory and animal tests performed under the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations; 

&#9679; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence; 

&#9679; 

preliminary human clinical studies to evaluate the drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness for its intended uses; 

&#9679; 

FDA review of whether the facility in which the drug is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued quality; and 

&#9679; 

submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA, and approval of the application by the FDA to allow sales of the drug. 

During preclinical testing, studies are performed with respect to the chemical and physical properties of candidate formulations. These studies are subject to GLP requirements. Biological testing is typically done in animal models to demonstrate the activity of the compound against the targeted disease or condition and to assess the apparent effects of the new product candidate on various organ systems, as well as its relative therapeutic effectiveness and safety. An IND application must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before studies in humans may commence. 

Clinical trial programs in humans generally follow a three-phase process. Typically, Phase 1 studies are conducted in small numbers of healthy volunteers or, on occasion, in patients afflicted with the target disease. Phase 1 studies are conducted to determine the metabolic and pharmacological action of the product candidate in humans and the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In Phase 2, studies are generally conducted in larger groups of patients having the target disease or condition in order to validate clinical endpoints, and to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of the product candidate and optimal dosing. This phase also helps determine further the safety profile of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials are generally conducted in patients having the target disease or condition to provide sufficient data for the statistical proof of effectiveness and safety of the product candidate as required by United States and foreign regulatory agencies. 

In the case of products for certain serious or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing may be done in patients with the disease rather than in healthy volunteers. Because these patients are already afflicted with the target disease or condition, it is possible that such studies will also provide results traditionally obtained in Phase 2 studies. These studies are often referred to as &#8220;Phase 1/2&#8221; studies. However, even if patients participate in initial human testing and a Phase 1/2 study is carried out, the sponsor is still responsible for obtaining all the data usually obtained in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. 

Before proceeding with a study, sponsors may seek a written agreement known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, from the FDA regarding the design, size, and conduct of a clinical trial. Among other things, SPAs can cover clinical studies for pivotal trials whose data will form the primary basis to establish a product&#8217;s efficacy. SPAs help establish up-front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of a clinical trial design to support a regulatory approval, but the agreement is not binding if new circumstances arise. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. 

United States law requires that studies conducted to support approval for product marketing be &#8220;adequate and well controlled.&#8221; In general, this means that either a placebo or a product already approved for the treatment of the disease or condition under study must be used as a reference control. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with good clinical practice requirements, and informed consent must be obtained from all study subjects. 

The clinical trial process for a new compound can take ten years or more to complete. The FDA may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be prevented from beginning or may be terminated by institutional review boards, who must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing authorization. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing authorization can result in additional limitations being placed on a product&#8217;s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Following the completion of a clinical trial, the data are analyzed to determine whether the trial successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness and whether a product approval application may be submitted. In the United States, if the product is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from laboratory, animal, and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed product labeling. 

Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers that we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA and must be registered with the FDA. The application generally will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process for the drug product, and determines that the facility is in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements. 

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing an NDA, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees can be significant. 

Each NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 45 to 60 days following submission of the application. If deemed complete, the FDA will &#8220;file&#8221; the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of New Drug Applications - six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, typically is not an actual approval but an &#8220;action letter&#8221; that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. The FDA&#8217;s review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. 

Significant legal and regulatory requirements also apply after FDA approval to market under an NDA. These include, among other things, requirements related to adverse event and other reporting, product advertising and promotion and ongoing adherence to cGMPs, as well as the need to submit appropriate new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians. 

The regulatory framework applicable to the production, distribution, marketing, and/or sale, of our products may change significantly from the current descriptions provided herein in the time that it may take for any of our products to reach a point at which a NDA is approved. 

Overall research, development, and approval times depend on a number of factors, including the period of review at FDA, the number of questions posed by the FDA during review, how long it takes to respond to the FDA&#8217;s questions, the severity or life-threatening nature of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, the availability of clinical investigators and eligible patients, the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical trials, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical trials. 

Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening Illnesses 

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and FDA regulations provide certain mechanisms for the accelerated &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; approval of products intended to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses which have been studied for safety and effectiveness and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The procedures permit early consultation and commitment from the FDA regarding the preclinical and clinical studies necessary to gain marketing approval. Provisions of this regulatory framework also permit, in certain cases, NDAs to be approved on the basis of valid surrogate endpoints of product effectiveness, thus accelerating the normal approval process. Where the FDA approves a product on the basis of a surrogate endpoint, it requires the sponsor to perform post-approval, or Phase 4, studies as a condition of approval, and may withdraw approval if post-approval studies do not confirm the intended clinical benefit or safety of the product. Special rules would also apply to the submission to the FDA of advertising and promotional materials prior to use.

Other United States Regulatory Requirements 

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Heath Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws. 

Moreover, we are now, and may become subject to, additional federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and/or the use, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of human tissue, waste, and hazardous substances, including radioactive and toxic materials and infectious disease agents used in conjunction with our research work. 

Reimbursement and Pricing Controls 

In many of the markets where we or our collaborative partners have targeted or will target Neutrolin for sale, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls (by law) and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Public and private health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA. 

Foreign Regulatory Requirements 

We and our collaborative partners may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be quite different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, manufacture, product registration and approval, and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we or our collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in those countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current United States law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country. 

International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. 

In the European Union, in order for our product candidates to be marketed and sold, we are required to comply with the Medical Devices Directive and obtain CE Mark certification. The CE Mark certification encompasses an extensive review of our quality management system which is inspected by a notified body&#8217;s auditor as part of a Stage 1 and 2 International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, 13485:2003 audit, in accordance with worldwide recognized ISO standards and applicable European Medical Devices Directives for quality management systems for medical device manufacturers. Once the quality management system and design dossier has been successfully audited by a notified body and reviewed and approved by a competent authority, a CE certificate for the medical device will be issued. We are also required to comply with other foreign regulations such as the requirement that we obtain Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approval before we can launch new products in Japan. The time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market our products may vary from U.S. approvals, and requirements for these approvals may differ from those required by the FDA.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These laws and regulations range from comprehensive device approval requirements for our medical device product to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements can be complex and could increase. We may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals in such countries and we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals. In addition, the export of certain of our products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to FDA export restrictions. Any failure to obtain product approvals in a timely fashion or to comply with state or foreign medical device laws and regulations may have a serious adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Intellectual Property 

CRMD003 and CRMD004 

On January 30, 2008, we entered into a License and Assignment Agreement, or the NDP License Agreement, with ND Partners, LLC, or NDP. Pursuant to the NDP License Agreement, NDP granted us exclusive, worldwide licenses for certain antimicrobial catheter lock solutions, processes for treating and inhibiting infections, a biocidal lock system and a taurolidine delivery apparatus, and the corresponding United States and foreign patents and applications (the &#8220;NDP Technology&#8221;). We acquired such licenses and patents through our assignment and assumption of NDP&#8217;s rights under certain separate license agreements by and between NDP and Dr. Hans-Dietrich Polaschegg, Dr. Klaus Sodemann, and Dr. Johannes Reinmueller. NDP also granted us exclusive licenses, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use and display certain trademarks in connection with the NDP Technology. As consideration in part for the rights to the NDP Technology, we paid NDP an initial licensing fee of $325,000 and granted NDP an equity interest in our company consisting of 365,534 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we are required to make payments to NDP upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales-based milestones. Certain of the milestone payments are to be made in the form of shares of common stock currently held in escrow for NDP, and other milestone payments are to be paid in cash. The maximum aggregate number of shares issuable upon achievement of milestones and the number of shares held in escrow is 145,543 shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2014, a certain milestone was achieved resulting in the release of 36,386 shares held in escrow. The number of shares held in escrow as of December 31, 2015 is 109,157 shares of common stock. The maximum aggregate amount of cash payments upon achievement of milestones is $3,000,000. Events that trigger milestone payments include but are not limited to the reaching of various stages of regulatory approval processes and certain worldwide net sales amounts. There were no milestones achieved in 2015. 

On April 11, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the NDP License Agreement. Under Article 6 of the NDP License Agreement, we were obligated to make a milestone payment of $500,000 to NDP upon the first issuance of a CE Mark for a licensed product, which payment was payable to NDP within 30 days after such issuance. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, we and NDP agreed to delay such milestone payment to a time, to be chosen by us, anytime within twelve months after the achievement of such issuance. As consideration for the amendment, we issued NDP a warrant to purchase 125,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. The warrant is exercisable immediately upon issuance and has a term of five years. The warrant contains a cashless exercise feature and standard adjustment features in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or similar events. During the year ended December 31, 2013, a milestone payment of $500,000 was earned by NDP upon the first issuance of the CE Mark for Neutrolin, which was converted in January 2014 into 50,000 Series C-3 non-voting preferred stock and 250,000 warrants at an exercise price of $1.50 per share. 

The NDP License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the last patent claim under the NDP License Agreement in a given country, or (ii) the payment of all milestone payments and release of all shares of our common stock held in escrow under the NDP License Agreement. Upon the expiration of the NDP License Agreement in each country, we will have an irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free exclusive license to the NDP Technology in such country. The NDP License Agreement also may be terminated by NDP if we materially breach or default under the NDP License Agreement and that breach is not cured within 60 days following the delivery of written notice to us, or by us on a country-by-country basis upon 60 days prior written notice. If the NDP License Agreement is terminated by either party, our rights to the NDP Technology will revert back to NDP.

&#160; 

&#160; 

On January 30, 2008, we also entered into an Exclusive License and Consulting Agreement with Dr. Polaschegg. Pursuant to the Polaschegg License Agreement, Dr. Polaschegg granted us an exclusive, worldwide license for a gel lock invention and certain taurolidine treatments and the corresponding United States patent applications (the &#8220;Polaschegg Technology&#8221;). The Polaschegg Technology served as a basis for CRMD004, which is the gel formation of Neutrolin. As consideration for the rights to the Polaschegg Technology, in addition to an initial fee of $5,000, we agreed to pay Dr. Polaschegg certain royalty payments ranging from 1% to 3% of the net sales of the Polaschegg Technology. The Polaschegg License Agreement also set forth certain minimum royalty payments (on an annual basis) to be made to Dr. Polaschegg in connection with the Polaschegg Technology, which payments range from $10,000 to $45,000. Additional minimum royalty payments would become payable to Dr. Polaschegg if he developed new intellectual property that was applied to the Polaschegg Technology. As of December 31, 2015, we recorded an aggregate of approximately $300,000 in licensing and minimum royalty payments under the Polaschegg License Agreement. 

We had the right to terminate the Polaschegg License Agreement with respect to the gel lock invention or taurolidine treatments (individually or together) upon 60 days notice. Dr. Polaschegg had the right to terminate the Polaschegg License Agreement with respect to the gel lock invention and/or taurolidine treatments if no product based on the particular portion of Polaschegg Technology has been made available to the market by the later of eight years after (i) the date of the Polaschegg License Agreement, and (ii) the priority date of any new patent. If the Polaschegg License Agreement is terminated with respect to any piece of Polaschegg Technology by either party, all rights with respect to such portion of Polaschegg Technology will revert to Dr. Polaschegg. In November 2015, we terminated the Polaschegg License Agreement. 

We believe that the patents and patent applications we have licensed pursuant to the NDP License Agreement cover effective solutions to the various problems discussed previously when using taurolidine in clinical applications, and specifically in hemodialysis applications. We intend to file additional patent applications to cover any additional related subject matter we develop. We filed five provisional patents covering additional applications using taurolidine in sutures, hydrogels and mesh products.
