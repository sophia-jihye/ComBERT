 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

OVERVIEW 

Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, a Pennsylvania business trust founded in 1960 and one of the first equity real estate investment trusts (&#8220;REITs&#8221;) in the United States, has a primary investment focus on retail shopping malls located in the eastern half of the United States, primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region. 

We currently own interests in &#32; 33 &#32; retail properties, of which 29 &#32;are operating properties and &#32; four &#32; &#32;are development or redevelopment properties. &#32; The 29 &#32;operating properties include 25 &#32; shopping malls and four &#32;other retail properties, have a total of 24.3 &#32;million square feet and are located in &#32; 10 &#32;states. We and partnerships in which we own an interest own 18.2 &#32;million square feet at these properties (excluding space owned by anchors). &#32;In 2015, we acquired Springfield Town Center in Springfield, Virginia and we sold two &#32;of our wholly owned mall properties and our partnership interest in one &#32;other retail property. We also sold another mall property in February 2016. The above property counts do not include Gadsden Mall in Gadsden, Alabama, Lycoming Mall in Pennsdale, Pennsylvania, New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg, Virginia, Palmer Park Mall in Easton, Pennsylvania, Wiregrass Commons Mall in Dothan, Alabama and two street retail properties in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania because these properties have been classified as &#8220;held for sale&#8221; as of December 31, 2015. Palmer Park Mall was sold in February 2016. &#32; 

There are 23 &#32;operating retail properties in our portfolio that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes. These consolidated properties have a total of 20.2 &#32;million square feet, of which we own 15.4 &#32;million square feet. The six &#32;operating retail properties that are owned by unconsolidated partnerships with third parties have a total of 4.1 &#32;million square feet, of which 2.8 &#32;million square feet are owned by such partnerships. &#32; 

The development and redevelopment portion of our portfolio contains four properties in three states, with two classified as &#8220;mixed use&#8221; (a combination of retail and other uses), one classified as &#8220;retail&#8221; (redevelopment of The Gallery at Market East into the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia), and one classified as &#8220;other.&#8221; &#32; 

We are a fully integrated, self-managed and self-administered REIT that has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In general, we are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our net taxable income and to meet certain other requirements in order to maintain the favorable tax treatment associated with qualifying as a REIT. 

PREIT&#8217;S BUSINESS 

We are primarily engaged in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, redevelopment, development and disposition of shopping malls. In general, our malls include tenants that are national or regional department stores, large format retailers or other anchors and a diverse mix of national, regional and local in-line stores offering apparel (women&#8217;s, family, teen, children&#8217;s, men&#8217;s), shoes, eyewear, cards and gifts, jewelry, sporting goods, home furnishings and personal care items, among other things. 

To enhance the experience for shoppers, most of our malls have restaurants and/or food courts, and some of the malls have multi-screen movie theaters and other entertainment options, either as part of the mall or on outparcels around the perimeter of the mall property. In addition, many of our malls have outparcels containing restaurants, banks or other stores. In their geographic trade areas, our malls frequently serve as a central place for community, promotional and charitable events. 

The largest mall in our retail portfolio is 1.4 million square feet and contains 115 &#32;stores, and the smallest is 0.5 million square feet and contains 52 &#32;stores. The other properties in our retail portfolio range from 370,000 &#32;to 780,000 &#32;square feet. 

We derive the substantial majority of our revenue from rent received under leases with tenants for space at retail properties in our real estate portfolio. In-line stores typically generate a majority of the revenue of a mall, with a relatively small proportion coming from anchor tenants, junior anchors or large format retailers. In general, our leases require tenants to pay minimum rent, which is a fixed amount specified in the lease, and which is often subject to scheduled increases during the term of the lease for longer term leases. In 2015 , 84% &#32;of the new leases that we signed contained scheduled rent increases, and these increases, which are typically scheduled to occur between two and four times during the term, ranged from 1.4% &#32;to 13.3% , with approximately 87% &#32;ranging from 2.0% &#32;to 4.0% . In addition or in the alternative, certain tenants are required to pay percentage rent, which can be either a percentage of their sales revenue that exceeds certain levels specified in their lease agreements, or a percentage of their total sales revenue. 

The majority of our leases also provide that the tenant will reimburse us for certain expenses relating to the property for common area maintenance (&#8220;CAM&#8221;), real estate taxes, utilities, insurance and other operating expenses incurred in the operation of the property subject, in some cases, to certain limitations. The proportion of the expenses for which tenants are 

responsible is historically related to the tenant&#8217;s pro rata share of space at the property. As discussed below, we have continued to shift the provision in our leases that addresses these items to be a fixed amount, which gives greater predictability to tenants, and a majority of such revenue is derived from leases specifying fixed CAM. 

Retail real estate industry participants sometimes classify malls based on the average sales per square foot of non anchor mall tenants, the population and average household income of the trade area and the geographic market, the growth rates of the population and average household income in the trade area and geographic market, and numerous other factors. Based on these factors, in general, malls that have high average sales per square foot and are in trade areas with large populations and high household incomes and/or growth rates are considered Class A malls, malls with average sales per square foot that are in the middle range of population or household income and/or growth rates are considered Class B malls, and malls with lower average sales and smaller populations and lower household incomes and/or growth rates are considered Class C malls. Although these classifications are defined differently by different market participants, in general, some of our malls are in the Class A range and many might be classified as Class B or Class C properties. The classification of a mall can change, and one of the goals of our current property strategic plans, remerchandising programs and non-core property disposition program is to increase the average sales per square foot of certain of our properties and correspondingly increase their rental income and cash flows, and thus potentially their class, in order to maximize the value of the property. The malls that we have sold pursuant to our strategic property disposition program have generally been Class C properties. Approximately 80.4% &#32;of our 2015 Net Operating Income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;) (a non-GAAP measure; as defined below) came from our Premier and Core Growth property categories (as described below), which generally include Class A and Class B properties. 

Portfolio Stratification 

Premier Malls 

When listing our malls in order by individual property 2015 sales per square foot, there is a group of six &#32;malls at the top of that list that collectively had 2015 average sales per square foot of $565 , average non anchor occupancy of 97.1% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 and contributed approximately 34.6% &#32;of our NOI in 2015. This &#8220;Premier&#8221; group includes such properties as Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and Willow Grove Park in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Excluded from the figures above is Springfield Town Center, a mall in Springfield, Virginia which we consider a Premier Mall, however, since we acquired this property in 2015, it is not part of our &#8220;Same Store&#8221; properties, which are properties that have been owned for the full periods presented and exclude properties acquired or disposed of or under redevelopment during the periods presented. 

Core Growth Malls 

The next 17 &#32;properties on our list are a collection of solidly performing properties that had 2015 average sales per square foot of $380 , average non anchor occupancy of 93.1% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 and contributed approximately 45.8% &#32;of our NOI in 2015. We divide this &#8220;Core Growth Malls&#8221; group further into &#8220;Core Growth Malls- Major Markets&#8221; and &#8220;Core Growth Malls- Market Dominant.&#8221; The Core Growth Malls- Major Markets group consists of malls that are located in the top 50 metropolitan statistical areas (&#8220;MSAs&#8221;) such as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC, and includes such properties as The Mall at Prince George&#8217;s and Francis Scott Key Mall in the Washington, DC MSA, and Moorestown Mall and Springfield Mall in the Philadelphia MSA. The Core Growth Malls- Market Dominant group consists of malls that are located in other MSAs, and includes such properties as Viewmont Mall in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Capital City Mall located near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. 

Non Core Malls 

The next six &#32;properties on our list, the &#8220;Non Core Malls,&#8221; consist of properties that we plan to sell. The Non Core Malls exhibit moderate performance, had 2015 average sales per square foot of $300 , average non anchor occupancy of 90.3% &#32;as of December 31, 2015 and contributed 8.2% &#32;of our NOI in 2015. Four of the Non Core Malls are under contract for sale, and one Non Core Mall (Palmer Park Mall in Easton, Pennsylvania) was sold in February 2016. 

Our portfolio also includes other retail properties including power centers, street level retail, office properties and properties under redevelopment. These new, sold and other retail properties contributed approximately 11.4% &#32;of our NOI in 2015. When stabilized, we expect Springfield Town Center to be classified as a Premier Mall. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

Our primary objective is to maximize the long-term value of the Company for our shareholders. To that end, our business goals are to obtain the highest possible rental income, tenant sales and occupancy at our properties in order to maximize our cash flows, net operating income, funds from operations, funds available for distribution to shareholders and other operating measures and results, and ultimately to maximize the values of our properties. 

To achieve this primary goal, we have developed a business strategy focused on increasing the values of our properties, and ultimately of the Company, which includes: 

&#8226; 

&#32;&#32;Raising the overall level of quality of our portfolio and of individual properties in our portfolio; 

&#8226; 

&#32;&#32;Improving the operating results of our properties; 

&#8226; 

&#32;&#32;Taking steps to position the Company for future growth opportunities; and 

&#8226; 

&#32;&#32;&#32;Improving our balance sheet by reducing debt and leverage, and maintaining a solid liquidity position. 

Raising the Overall Level of Quality of Our Portfolio and of Individual Properties in Our Portfolio 

A key element of our strategy is to elevate the overall level of quality of our portfolio. We intend to accomplish this, in part, by disposing of lower productivity non-core properties and by selectively acquiring higher quality assets. We also plan to enhance the value of some of our properties (most of which are in the Core Growth group). 

Portfolio Actions . We continue to refine our collection of properties to enhance the overall quality of the portfolio. We seek to have a portfolio that derives most of its NOI (a non-GAAP measure; as defined below) from higher productivity properties, and one that is represented in the vicinity of a few major east coast cities. One avenue for raising the level of quality of our portfolio is to dispose of certain non-core assets, which have sales productivity or occupancy below the average for our portfolio. In 2015, we sold Uniontown Mall and Voorhees Town Center, and in February 2016 we sold Palmer Park Mall. These properties had average aggregate sales per square foot of $ 283 &#32;and occupancy of 90.2% , which were materially less than the figures for the balance of our portfolio. In 2015, we also sold our 50% interest in Springfield Park, a shopping center in Springfield, Pennsylvania. We are also currently seeking to sell five other malls, four of which are currently under contract for sale. We anticipate that the proposed disposition of these lower-performing properties, together with the property sales that have already closed, will result in improved operating metrics for the remaining collection of assets (other things being equal), which are indicators of the quality of our portfolio. 

In addition to our strategic property disposition program, we seek to selectively acquire high quality properties to enhance our portfolio. In 2015, we acquired Springfield Town Center, a property that was recently redeveloped. 

As discussed below under &#8220;&#8212;Improving the Operating Results of Our Properties,&#8221; we believe that both these dispositions and this acquisition will aid our bargaining position in lease negotiations and potentially help increase rental rates. 

Redevelopment . We might also seek to improve particular properties, to increase the potential value of properties in our portfolio, and to maintain or enhance their competitive positions by redeveloping them. We do so in order to attract more customers and retailers, which we expect to lead to increases in sales, occupancy and rental rates. Redevelopments are generally more involved than strategic property plans or remerchandising programs and usually require some use of capital. The table below sets forth our property redevelopment summary as of December 31, 2015.

-Opening a Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods in the former JCPenney anchor store location in early 2017. 

In July 2014, we entered into a 50/50 joint venture with The Macerich Company (&#8220;Macerich&#8221;) to redevelop the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia. In connection therewith, we contributed and sold real estate assets to the venture and Macerich acquired its interest in the venture and real estate from us for $106.8 million &#32;in cash. We and Macerich are jointly and severally responsible for a minimum investment in the project of $300.0 million. The Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia is in a key location in Philadelphia, strategically positioned above regional mass transit, adjacent to the convention center and tourism sites, and amidst numerous offices and residential sites. An important aspect of any redevelopment project, including the redevelopment of the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia, is its effect on the property and on the tenants and customers during the time that a redevelopment is taking place. While we might undertake a redevelopment to maximize the long term performance of the property, in the short term, the operations and performance of the property, as measured by sales, occupancy and NOI, might be negatively affected. Tenants might be dislodged as space for the redevelopment is aggregated, which affects tenant sales and rental rates. As the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia is redeveloped, it is expected that occupancy, sales and NOI will continue to decrease until the newly constructed space is completed, leased and occupied. As of December 31, 2015, the portion of the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia that was formerly known as Gallery I is closed, and the rest of the inline space at the Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia is expected to be closed in 2016. Through December 31, 2015, we had incurred costs of $31.9 million relating to the redevelopment. 

Mall-Specific Plans . We seek to unlock value in our portfolio through a variety of targeted efforts at our properties. We believe that certain of our properties, including ones which are in trade areas around major cities or are leading properties in secondary markets, can benefit from strategic remerchandising strategies, including, for example, selective re-tenanting of certain spaces in certain properties with higher quality, better-matched tenants. Based on the demographics of the trade area or the relevant competition, we believe that this subset of properties provides opportunities for meaningful value creation at the property level. We believe that we can successfully implement particular strategies at these assets, such as adding restaurants, making fashion and certain fashion categories the focus of the retailers at such properties, and relocating and right-sizing certain stores. We also continuously work to optimize the match between the demographics of the trade area, such as the household income level, and the nature and mix of tenants at such properties. We strive to work closely with tenants to enhance their merchandising opportunities at our properties. We believe that these approaches can attract more national and other tenants to the property and can lead to higher occupancy and NOI. 

Shopper Experiences . In addition to such property-wide remerchandising efforts, we also seek to offer unique shopper experiences at our properties by having tenants that provide products, services or interactions that are unlike other offerings in the trade area. We seek to add first-to-market tenants, entertainment options, beauty and fashion purveyors, and unique tenants like a popular upscale flea market, as well as providing amenities like children&#8217;s play areas and mall shopping smartphone apps. In 2015, a number of well-known retailers opened stores at our properties. The following operators also opened stores or expanded in our portfolio: Lego, Lululemon Athletica, Top Shop, Michael Kors, Tumi, Dave &#38; Busters, Journey&#8217;s and Field and Stream, among others. We are also striving to add restaurants of recognized chefs and other dining options with unique concepts, as studies indicate that mall restaurant customers spend more and stay on the property longer. 

Improving the Operating Results of Our Properties 

We aim to improve the overall operational performance of our portfolio of properties with a multi-pronged approach. 

Occupancy . We continue to work to increase non anchor and total occupancy in our properties. In 2015, non anchor occupancy at our Same Store malls decreased &#32;by 160 &#32;basis points to 93.7% &#32;and total occupancy at our Same Store malls decreased &#32;by 180 &#32;basis points to 95.4% . During 2015, we experienced closings related to tenant bankruptcies and anchor store closings amounting to 404,764 &#32;square feet, or 2.1% &#32;of our Same Store portfolio. In connection with the remerchandising plans at several of our properties described above, we are seeking or have obtained tenants for space in our properties that are the focus of remerchandising plans and for new space of different types such as pads or kiosks. We are also seeking tenants that have not previously been prevalent at our mall properties. 

Key Tenants; Mall Leasing . We continue to recruit, and expand our relationships with, certain high profile retailers, and to initiate and expand our relationships with other quality and first-to-market retailers or concepts. We coordinate closely with tenants on new store locations in an effort to position our properties for our tenants&#8217; latest concept or store prototype, in order to drive traffic to our malls and stimulate customer spending. We believe that increasing our occupancy in ways that are tailored to particular properties will be helpful to our leasing efforts and will help increase rental rates and tenant sales. 

Rental Rates and Releasing Spreads . For the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated sales per square foot of $ 435 &#32;from our operating malls, an increase of 8.5% &#32;from 2014, excluding sold malls and mall under redevelopment. At properties with improved or already higher sales per square foot, these sales levels have helped attract new tenants and helped us retain current tenants that seek to take advantage of the property&#8217;s increased productivity. We have worked to capitalize on the increase in, or high level of, sales per square foot by seeking positive rent renewal spreads, including from renewals and new leases following expirations of leases entered into during the economic downturn of recent years. In 2015, renewal spreads increased 5.4% &#32;on non anchor leases under 10,000 square feet and 7.9% &#32;for non anchor leases of at least 10,000 square feet. More than half of the near-term lease expirations in our portfolio are in the Premier and Core Growth groups of properties. Despite a significant increase in sales productivity, occupancy costs have remained relatively constant. We believe we have a meaningful opportunity to drive NOI and asset values by capitalizing on this increased sales productivity through increased rents on renewals or replacing underperforming tenants. 

As discussed above, in 2015, we sold two Non-Core malls and our interests in a partnership classified as &#8220;other retail,&#8221; and in February 2016, we sold one Non-Core mall. We are now seeking to dispose of five more Non-Core malls. We believe that the disposition of these less productive assets will help improve our negotiating position with retailers with multiple stores in our portfolio (including stores at these properties), and potentially enable us to obtain higher rental rates from them in the remaining properties. 

Specialty Leasing and Partnership Marketing . Some space at our properties might be available for a shorter period of time, pending a lease with a permanent tenant or in connection with a redevelopment. We strive to manage the use of this space through our specialty leasing function, which manages the short term leasing of stores and the licensing of income-generating carts and kiosks, with the goal of maximizing the rent we receive during the period when a space is not subject to a longer term lease. 

We also seek to generate ancillary revenue (such as sponsorship marketing revenue and promotional income) from the properties in our portfolio. We believe that increased efforts in this area can enable us to increase the proportion of net operating income derived from ancillary revenue. 

Operating Expenses and CAM Charges . Our strategy for improving operating results also includes efforts to control or reduce the costs of operating our properties. With respect to operating expenses, we have taken steps to manage a significant proportion of them through contracts with third party vendors for housekeeping and maintenance, security services, landscaping and trash removal. These contracts provide reasonable control, certainty and predictability. For example, we renegotiated our security contract in 2013 to better control our operating expenses in the future. We also seek to contain certain expenses through our active programs for managing utility expense and real estate taxes. We have taken advantage of opportunities to buy electricity economically in states that have opened their energy markets to competition, and we expect to continue with this approach. In 2015, we saw a decrease in property operating expenses at our properties as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower snow removal and utility expenses in 2015 at our properties located in the Mid Atlantic States, which were affected by a severe winter in 2014 with numerous snowfalls with significant accumulation and higher electric utility rates. We also review the annual tax assessments of our properties and, when appropriate, pursue appeals. 

With respect to CAM charges, we have continued to offer tenants an option of fixed CAM, in contrast to the traditional pro rata CAM. Fixed CAM, while shifting some risk to us as landlord, offers tenants increased predictability of their costs, a decrease in the number of items to be negotiated in a lease thus speeding lease execution, and reduced need for detailed CAM billings, reconciliations and collections. It is taking several years for all tenants of our properties to be subject to leases with a fixed CAM provision, but we believe there is an opportunity to increase our cost recoveries. 

Taking Steps to Position the Company for Future Growth Opportunities 

We are taking steps to position the Company to generate future growth. In connection therewith, we have implemented processes designed to ensure strong internal discipline in the use, harvesting and recycling of our capital, and these processes will be applied in connection with proposals to redevelop properties or to reposition properties with a mix of uses, or possibly, in the future, to acquire additional properties. 

External Opportunities . We seek to acquire, in an opportunistic, selective and disciplined manner, properties that are well-located, that are in trade areas with growing or stable demographics, that have operating metrics that are better than or equal to our existing portfolio averages, and that we believe have strong potential for increased cash flows and appreciation in value if we call upon our relationships with retailers and apply our skills in asset management and redevelopment. We also seek to acquire additional parcels or properties that are included within, or adjacent to, the properties already in our portfolio, in order to gain greater control over the merchandising and tenant mix of a property. Taking advantage of any acquisition opportunities will likely involve some use of debt or equity capital. As discussed above, in March 2015, we completed the acquisition of Springfield Town Center. The redevelopment of the property, which has been underway since 2013, is complete, and we expect operations at the property to stabilize in 2018. 

We pursue development of retail and mixed use projects that we expect can meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. We seek to leverage our skill sets in site selection, entitlement and planning, design, cost estimation and project management to develop new retail and mixed use properties. We seek properties in trade areas that we believe have sufficient demand, once developed, to generate cash flows that meet the financial thresholds we establish in the given environment. We manage all aspects of these undertakings, including market and trade area research, acquisition, preliminary development work, construction and leasing. In August 2015, Gloucester Premium Outlets in Gloucester Township, New Jersey, a property owned by a partnership in which we own a 25% interest, opened. 

Depending on the nature of the acquisition or development opportunity, we might involve a partner, including in connection with projects involving a use other than retail. 

Organic Opportunities . We look for ways to maximize the value of our assets by adding a mix of uses, such as office or multi-family residential housing, initiated either by ourselves or with a partner, that are designed to attract a greater number of people to the property. Multiple constituencies, from local governments to city planners to citizen groups, have indicated a preference for in-place development, development near transportation hubs, the addition of uses to existing properties, and sustainable development, as opposed to locating, acquiring and developing new green field sites. Also, if appropriate, we will seek to attract certain nontraditional tenants to these properties, including tenants using the space for purposes such as entertainment, education, health care, government and child care, which can bring larger numbers of people to the property, as well as regional, local or nontraditional retailers. Such uses will, we believe, increase traffic and enable us to generate additional revenue and grow the value of the property. 

Improving Our Balance Sheet by Reducing Debt and Leverage; Maintaining Liquidity 

Leverage . From 2012 to 2014, we reduced our ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value (as defined in our principal credit agreements) largely because of our strategic property disposition program, which generated proceeds that were used to pay down debt, and which, in turn, generally offset amounts borrowed in connection with various projects and acquisitions. While our ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value increased following our acquisition of Springfield Town Center, we continue to contemplate ways to reduce our leverage further through a variety of means available to us. These means might include selling properties or interests in properties with values in excess of their mortgage loans and applying any excess proceeds to debt reduction; entering into joint ventures or other partnerships or arrangements involving our contribution of assets; issuing common or preferred equity or equity-related securities if market conditions are favorable; or through other actions. We are also striving to reduce further our ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value by increasing our Gross Asset Value through improving our operating performance. 

Mortgage Loan Refinancings and Repayments . We might pursue opportunities to make favorable changes to individual mortgage loans on our properties. When we refinance such loans, we might seek a new term, better rates and excess proceeds. An aspect of our approach to debt financing is that we strive to lengthen and stagger the maturities of our debt obligations in order to better manage our future capital requirements. We might seek to repay certain mortgage loans in full in order to unencumber the associated properties, which enables us to increase our pool of unencumbered assets, have greater financial flexibility and obtain additional financing, like our unsecured 2013 Revolving Facility and our unsecured Term Loans. 

Liquidity . As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $22.9 million &#32;in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that this amount and our net cash provided by operations, together with the available credit under the 2013 Revolving Facility, provide sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity requirements and to take advantage of opportunities in the short to intermediate term. 

Capital Recycling . We regularly conduct portfolio property reviews and, if appropriate, we seek to dispose of malls, other retail properties or outparcels that we do not believe meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. Disposing of these properties can enable us to redeploy or recycle our capital to other uses, such as to repay debt, to reinvest in other real estate assets and development and redevelopment projects, and for other corporate purposes. 

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 

Recent Acquisition and Dispositions 

In continuing to execute our strategy of elevating the quality of our portfolio, in 2015, we acquired one property, Springfield Town Center in Springfield, Virginia, and we disposed of two Non Core Mall properties and interests in a property classified as &#8220;other retail.&#8221; 

Acquisition . On March 31, 2015, we acquired Springfield Town Center in Springfield, Virginia for aggregate consideration of $486.6 million, consisting of the following components: (i) the assumption and immediate payoff of $263.8 million of indebtedness owed to affiliates of Vornado Realty L.P.; (ii) 6,250,000 OP Units valued at $145.2 million, (iii) liabilities relating to tenant improvements and allowances of $14.8 million, (iv) the estimated present value of the &#8220;Earnout&#8221; (as described below) of $8.6 million, and (v) the remainder in cash. The seller is potentially entitled to receive consideration (the &#8220;Earnout&#8221;) under the terms of the Contribution Agreement which will be calculated as of March 31, 2018.

At the time of sale, the two Non Core Malls sold in 2015 and one property sold in February 2016 had aggregate average trailing 12 month sales per square foot of $ 283 &#32;and non-anchor occupancy of 90.2% . 

In 2015, we also sold our entire 50% partnership interest in Springfield Park power center located in Springfield, Pennsylvania for $20.2 million and recognized a gain of $12.0 million. 

We are seeking to to dispose of seven more properties: New River Valley Mall in Christiansburg, Virginia; Gadsden Mall in Gadsden, Alabama; Wiregrass Mall in Dothan, Alabama; Lycoming Mall in Pennsdale, Pennsylvania; Washington Crown Center in Washington, Pennsylvania; and two street retail properties in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Palmer Park Mall in Easton, Pennsylvania was sold in February 2016. 

Operating Performance 

Funds From Operations (&#8220;FFO&#8221;), a non-GAAP measure, increased 5.3% &#32;from the prior year, and FFO as adjusted, another non-GAAP measure, increased 2.7% &#32;from the prior year. Adjustments included accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and mortgage prepayment penalty, acquisition costs, employee separation expense and hedging losses. FFO as adjusted per share decreased 3.6% &#32;over 2014 primarily due to the impact of the 6,250,000 OP Units issued in connection with the acquisition of Springfield Town Center 

Same Store net operating income (&#8220;Same Store NOI&#8221;), a non-GAAP measure, increased 2.6% &#32;over the prior year. Same Store NOI, excluding lease termination revenue, increased 2.6% &#32;compared to 2014. The proportion of Same Store NOI from our Premier and Core Growth properties increased to 80.4% &#32;from 79.6% . 

Net loss was $129.6 million &#32;in 2015, an increase of $115.3 million &#32;compared to a net loss of $14.3 million &#32;in 2014, but such increase was primarily the result of a $120.1 million increase in impairment charges in 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by an increase in Same Store NOI. 

Renewal spreads increased 5.4% &#32;on non anchor leases under 10,000 square feet and 7.9% &#32;for non anchor leases of at least 10,000 square feet. Renewal spreads increased 5.4% &#32;for all leases including anchors and non anchors. Average gross rent at Premier Malls and Core Growth Malls increased 5.7% , and average gross rent increased 7.5% &#32;for all properties. 

Retail portfolio occupancy at December 31, 2015 was 95.0% , a decrease &#32;of 230 &#32;basis points. Non anchor occupancy was 93.3% , a decrease &#32;of 250 &#32;basis points. Same Store mall occupancy decreased &#32; 180 &#32;basis points to 95.4% . Same Store non anchor occupancy decreased 160 &#32;basis points to 93.7% . The decrease is primarily due to store closings of tenants that filed for bankruptcy in late 2014 and early 2015 that remained vacant as of December 31, 2015. 

Sales per square foot at our mall properties were $435 , an increase of 8.5% &#32;from 2014, including consolidated and unconsolidated properties. 

Descriptions of each non-GAAP measure mentioned above and the related reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures are located in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Results of Operations&#8212;Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Measures.&#8221; 

Financing Activity 

We have entered into four credit agreements (collectively, the &#8220;Credit Agreements&#8221;), as further discussed and defined below: (1) the 2013 Revolving Facility, (2) the 2014 7-Year Term Loan, (3) the 2014 5-Year Term Loan, and (4) the 2015 5-Year Term Loan. The 2014 7-Year Term Loan, the 2014 5-Year Term Loan and the 2015 5-Year Term Loan are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Term Loans.&#8221; 

Leverage . After significant reductions in 2013 and 2012, and a modest reduction in 2014, our ratio of Total Liabilities to Gross Asset Value under our Credit Agreements increased by 167 basis points to 49.3% &#32;as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Springfield Town Center, which was acquired with $340.0 million of borrowings and assumed liabilities and $145.2 million &#32;of equity in the form of 6,250,000 OP Units. 

2015 5-Year Term Loan. &#32;&#32;In June 2015, we entered into a five year term loan agreement (the &#8220;2015 5-Year Term Loan&#8221;) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, PNC Bank, National Association and the other financial institutions signatory thereto, for a $150.0 million senior unsecured five year term loan facility. The maturity date of the 2015 5-Year Term Loan is June 2020. At closing, we borrowed the entire $150.0 million under the 2015 5-Year Term Loan and used the proceeds to repay $150.0 million of the then outstanding balance under the 2013 Revolving Facility. 

Mortgage Loan Activity . In June 2015, we entered into a $96.2 million &#32;mortgage loan secured by Patrick Henry Mall in Newport News, Virginia. The mortgage loan has a fixed interest rate of 4.35% per annum and a maturity date of July 2025 &#32;. 

In April 2015, we repaid a $55.3 million &#32;mortgage loan plus accrued interest secured by Magnolia Mall in Florence, South 

Carolina using $40.0 million &#32;from our 2013 Revolving Facility and the balance from available working capital. 

In September 2015, we entered into a $170.0 million &#32;mortgage loan secured by Willow Grove Park in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. The mortgage loan has a fixed interest rate of 3.88% per annum and a maturity date of October 2025 . 

In September 2015, the unconsolidated partnership that owns Springfield Mall in Springfield, Pennsylvania entered into a $65.0 

million mortgage loan secured by the property with a fixed interest rate of 4.45% and a term of 10 years with no options to 

extend. The proceeds were used to repay the existing $61.7 million mortgage loan plus accrued interest. We received $1.0 

million of proceeds as a distribution in connection with the financing. 

CAPITAL STRATEGY 

In support of the business strategies described above, our long-term corporate finance objective is to maximize the availability and minimize the cost of the capital we employ to fund our operations. In pursuit of this objective and for other business reasons, we seek the broadest range of funding sources (including commercial banks, institutional lenders, equity and debt investors and joint venture partners) and funding vehicles (including mortgage loans, commercial loans, sales of properties or interests in properties, and debt and equity securities) available to us on the most favorable terms. We pursue this goal by maintaining relationships with various capital sources and utilizing a variety of financing instruments, enhancing our flexibility to execute our business strategy in different economic environments or at different points in the business cycle. 

Two &#32;mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of $220.5 million &#32;secured by consolidated properties are scheduled to mature in 2016, and two &#32;mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of $153.4 million &#32;secured by a consolidated property and one unconsolidated property are scheduled to mature in 2017. We expect to have sufficient resources to repay all of such loans in full on their maturity dates. While mortgage interest rates remain relatively low, we will seek to extend these mortgage loans to the maximum extent possible, or to replace them with longer term mortgage loans. In the case of the $79.3 million mortgage loan on Valley Mall, which matures in 2016, we intend to repay amounts due with borrowings from our 2013 Revolving Facility. 

In general, in determining the amount and type of debt capital to employ in our business, we consider several factors, including: general economic conditions, the capital market environment, prevailing and forecasted interest rates for various debt instruments, the cost of equity capital, property values, capitalization rates for mall properties, our financing needs for acquisition, redevelopment and development opportunities, the debt ratios of other mall REITs and publicly-traded real estate companies, and the federal tax law requirement that REITs distribute at least 90% of net taxable income, among other factors. 

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial market risks, including interest rate risk on our interest-bearing liabilities. We attempt to limit these risks by following established risk management policies, procedures and strategies, including the use of various types of financial instruments. To manage interest rate risk and limit overall interest cost, we may employ interest rate swaps, options, forwards, caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on our underlying exposure, and subject to our ability to satisfy collateral requirements. 

Capital Availability 

To maintain our status as a REIT, we are required, under federal tax laws, to distribute to shareholders 90% of our net taxable income, which generally leaves insufficient funds to finance major initiatives internally. Because of these requirements, we ordinarily fund most of our significant capital requirements, such as the capital for acquisitions, redevelopments and developments, through secured and unsecured indebtedness, sales of properties or interests in properties and, when appropriate, the issuance of additional debt, equity or equity-related securities. 

In 2015, we recast our $400.0 million 2013 Revolving Facility. In 2014 and 2015, we entered the Term Loans for an aggregate amount of $400.0 million: a five year agreement for a $150.0 million facility, expandable to $300.0 million, a seven year agreement for a $100.0 million facility, expandable to $200.0 million and a five year agreement for a $150.0 million facility. Certain covenants and provisions of these loans might restrict our ability to use our cash flows and any debt or equity capital we obtain to execute our strategy. Following recent property sales, the net operating income (&#8220;NOI&#8221;) from the Company&#8217;s remaining unencumbered properties is at a level such that within the Unencumbered Debt Yield covenant (as described below) under the Credit Agreements, the maximum amount that was available to be borrowed by the Company under the 2013 Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2015 was $301.0 million . 

In addition, our ability to finance our growth using these sources depends, in part, on our creditworthiness, the availability of credit to us, the market for our securities at the time or times we need capital and prevailing conditions in the capital and credit markets, among other things. 

OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE 

We hold our interests in our portfolio of properties through our operating partnership, PREIT Associates, L.P. We are the sole general partner of PREIT Associates and, as of December 31, 2015 , held a 89.2% &#32;controlling interest in PREIT Associates. We consolidate PREIT Associates for financial reporting purposes. We own our interests in our properties through various ownership structures, including partnerships and tenancy in common arrangements (collectively, &#8220;partnerships&#8221;). PREIT owns interests in some of these properties directly and has pledged the entire economic benefit of ownership to PREIT Associates. PREIT Associates&#8217; direct or indirect economic interest in the properties ranges from 25% or 50% (for eight &#32;partnership properties) up to 100%. See &#8220;Item 2. Properties&#8212;Retail Properties.&#8221; 

We provide management, leasing and real estate development services through two of our subsidiaries: PREIT Services, LLC (&#8220;PREIT Services&#8221;), which generally develops and manages properties that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes, and PREIT-RUBIN, Inc. (&#8220;PRI&#8221;), which generally develops and manages properties that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes, including properties owned by partnerships in which we own an interest, and properties that are owned by third parties in which we do not have an interest. PREIT Services and PRI are consolidated. PRI is a taxable REIT subsidiary, as defined by federal tax laws, which means that it is able to offer additional services to tenants without jeopardizing our continuing qualification as a REIT under federal tax law. 

COMPETITION 

Competition in the retail real estate market is intense. We compete with other public and private retail real estate companies, including companies that own or manage malls, power centers, strip centers, lifestyle centers, factory outlet centers, theme/festival centers and community centers, as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners, particularly those with properties near our properties, on the basis of several factors, including location and rent charged. We compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties, as well as to attract anchor and in-line stores and other tenants. We also compete to acquire land for new site development or to acquire parcels or properties to add to our existing properties. Our malls and our other retail properties face competition from similar retail centers, including more recently developed or renovated centers that are near our retail properties. We also face competition from a variety of different retail formats, including internet retailers, discount or value retailers, home shopping networks, mail order operators, catalogs, and telemarketers. Our tenants face competition from companies at the same and other properties and from other retail channels or formats as well, including internet retailers. This competition could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the amount of rent and expense reimbursements that we receive. 

The existence or development of competing retail properties and the related increased competition for tenants might, subject to the terms and conditions of our Credit Agreements, lead us to make capital improvements to properties that we would have deferred or would not have otherwise planned to make and might affect occupancy and net operating income of such properties. Any such capital improvements, undertaken individually or collectively, would involve costs and expenses that could adversely affect our results of operations. 

We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of malls, other retail properties and prime development sites or sites adjacent to our properties, including institutional pension funds, other REITs and other owner-operators of retail properties. When we seek to make acquisitions, competitors might drive up the price we must pay for properties, parcels, other assets or other companies or might themselves succeed in acquiring those properties, parcels, assets or companies. In addition, our potential acquisition targets might find our competitors to be more attractive suitors if they have greater resources, are willing to pay more, or have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger REITs might enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital, a better ability to raise capital, a better ability to finance an acquisition, better cash flow and enhanced operating efficiencies. We might not succeed in acquiring retail properties or development sites that we seek, or, if we pay a higher price for a property or site, or generate lower cash flow from an acquired property or site than we expect, our investment returns will be reduced, which will adversely affect the value of our securities. 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances, regulations and case law, an owner, former owner or operator of real estate might be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances present at, on, under, in or released from its property, regardless of whether the owner, operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Contamination might adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell or lease real estate or borrow with real estate as collateral. In connection with our ownership, operation, management, development and redevelopment of properties, or any other properties we acquire in the future, we might be liable under these laws and might incur costs in responding to these liabilities. 

Each of our retail properties has been subjected to a Phase I or similar environmental audit (which involves a visual property inspection and a review of records, but not soil sampling or ground water analysis) by environmental consultants. These audits have not revealed, and we are not aware of, any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. It is possible, however, that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware. 

We are aware of certain past environmental matters at some of our properties. We have, in the past, investigated and, where appropriate, performed remediation of such environmental matters, but we might be required in the future to perform testing relating to these matters or to satisfy requirements for further remediation, or we might incur liability as a result of such environmental matters. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business and Our Properties&#8212;We might incur costs to comply with environmental laws, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.&#8221; 

EMPLOYEES 

We had 397 &#32;employees at our properties and in our corporate office as of December 31, 2015 . None of our employees are represented by a labor union. 

INSURANCE 

We have comprehensive liability, fire, flood, cyber liability, terrorism, extended coverage and rental loss insurance that we believe is adequate and consistent with the level of coverage that is standard in our industry. We cannot assure you, however, that our insurance coverage will be adequate to protect against a loss of our invested capital or anticipated profits, or that we will be able to obtain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future. 

STATUS AS A REIT 

We conduct our operations in a manner intended to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Generally, as a REIT, we will not be subject to federal or state income taxes on our net taxable income that we currently distribute to our shareholders. Our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to meet various qualification tests (including dividend distribution, asset ownership and income tests) and certain share ownership requirements prescribed in the Internal Revenue Code. 

CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS 

Our principal executive offices are located at The Bellevue, 200 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102. 

SEASONALITY 

There is seasonality in the retail real estate industry. Retail property leases often provide for the payment of all or a portion of rent based on a percentage of a tenant&#8217;s sales revenue, or sales revenue over certain levels. Income from such rent is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met. The sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter, during the December holiday season. Also, many new and temporary leases are entered into later in the year in anticipation of the holiday season and a higher number of tenants vacate their space early in the year. As a result, our occupancy and cash flows are generally higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first and second quarters. Our concentration in the retail sector increases our exposure to seasonality and has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in a greater percentage of our cash flows being received in the fourth quarter.
