(5) &#160; 

See General Trends and Outlook , under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K regarding the incident that occurred at WES&#8217;s DBM complex. 

Because we reflect our ownership interest in WES on a consolidated basis and have no independent operations or material assets outside those of WES, our segment analysis and presentation is the same as that of WES. WES&#8217;s operations are organized into a single operating segment that engages in gathering, processing, compressing, treating and transporting Anadarko and third-party natural gas, condensate, NGLs and crude oil in the United States. See Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosure of revenues, profits and total assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES 

Acquisitions. On March 2, 2015, WES acquired Anadarko&#8217;s interest in DBJV, which owns a 50% interest in a gathering system and related facilities located in the Delaware Basin in Loving, Ward, Winkler and Reeves Counties, Texas. WES will make a cash payment on March 31, 2020, to Anadarko as consideration for the acquisition of DBJV. WES currently estimates the future payment will be $282.8 million, the net present value of which was $174.3 million as of the acquisition date and $188.7 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015. See Note 2&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures &#32; and Note 14&#8212;Subsequent Events &#32;in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;under Part II , Item 8 &#32;of this Form 10-K . 

Divestitures. During the third quarter of 2015, the Dew and Pinnacle systems in East Texas were sold to a third party for net proceeds of $145.6 million , after closing adjustments, resulting in a net gain on sale of $77.3 million &#32;recorded as Gain on divestiture and other, net in the consolidated statements of income. 

Presentation of WES assets. &#160; The term &#8220;WES assets&#8221; refers to the assets indirectly owned and interests accounted for under the equity method (see Note 9&#8212;Equity Investments &#32;in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;under Part II , Item 8 &#32;of this Form 10-K ) by us through our partnership interests in WES as of December 31, 2015 . Because Anadarko controls WES through its ownership and control of us, and because we own the entire interest in WES GP, each of WES&#8217;s acquisitions of WES assets from Anadarko has been considered a transfer of net assets between entities under common control. As such, WES assets acquired from Anadarko were initially recorded at Anadarko&#8217;s historic carrying value, which did not correlate to the total acquisition price paid by WES (see Note 2&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures &#32;in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;under Part II , Item 8 &#32;of this Form 10-K ). Further, after an acquisition of WES assets from Anadarko, we (by virtue of our consolidation of WES) and WES may be required to recast our financial statements to include the activities of such WES assets from the date of common control. 

WGP&#8217;s historical financial statements previously filed with the SEC have been recast in this Form 10-K &#32;to include the results attributable to the DBJV system as if WES owned DBJV for all periods presented. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior to WES&#8217;s acquisition of DBJV have been prepared from Anadarko&#8217;s historical cost-basis accounts and may not necessarily be indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred if WES had owned DBJV during the periods reported. 

EQUITY OFFERINGS 

Public equity offerings. &#32;In June 2015, Anadarko sold 2,300,000 of its WGP common units to the public through an underwritten offering, including 300,000 common units pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option. WGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expense in, the public offering. 

Tangible equity units. &#32;In June 2015, Anadarko completed the public issuance of 9,200,000 , 7.50% &#32;TEUs, including 1,200,000 &#32;TEUs pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option, at a price to the public of $50.00 &#32;per TEU. Each TEU that Anadarko issued consists of (1) a prepaid equity purchase contract for WGP common units owned by Anadarko (subject to Anadarko&#8217;s right to elect to deliver shares of its common stock in lieu of such WGP common units) and (2) a senior amortizing note due June 7, 2018. WGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expense in, the public offering. See Note 10&#8212;Tangible Equity Units &#32;in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;under Part II , Item 8 &#32;of Anadarko&#8217;s Form 10-K &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;(which is not, and shall not be deemed to be, incorporated by reference herein), for a full discussion of the TEUs. 

WES equity offerings. &#32;Pursuant to WES&#8217;s $500.0 million COP, during the year ended December 31, 2015, WES issued 873,525 &#32;common units, at an average price of $66.61 , generating proceeds to WES of $57.4 million &#32;(net of $0.8 million &#32;for the underwriting discount and other offering expenses). Net proceeds were used for general partnership purposes, including funding capital expenditures. Gross proceeds generated during the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, were zero &#32;and $58.2 million , respectively. Commissions paid during the three months and year ended December 31, 2015, were zero &#32;and $0.6 million , respectively. 

STRATEGY 

Our primary business objective is to continue to increase our cash distributions per unit over time, which can only be achieved if WES meets its primary business objective of increasing its cash distributions per unit over time. To accomplish this objective, WES intends to execute the following strategy: 

&#8226; 

Pursuing accretive acquisitions. &#32;WES expects to continue to pursue accretive acquisitions of midstream energy assets from Anadarko and third parties. 

&#8226; 

Capitalizing on organic growth opportunities. &#32;WES expects to grow certain of its systems organically over time by meeting Anadarko&#8217;s and its other customers&#8217; midstream service needs that result from their drilling activity in its areas of operation. WES continually evaluates economically attractive organic expansion opportunities in existing or new areas of operation that allow it to leverage its existing infrastructure, operating expertise and customer relationships by constructing and expanding systems to meet new or increased demand of its services. 

&#8226; 

Increasing third-party volumes to WES&#8217;s systems. &#32;WES continues to actively market its midstream services to, and pursue strategic relationships with, third-party producers and customers with the intention of attracting additional volumes and/or expansion opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Managing commodity price exposure. &#32;WES intends to continue limiting its direct exposure to commodity price changes and promote cash flow stability by pursuing a contract structure designed to mitigate exposure to a majority of the commodity price uncertainty through the use of fee-based contracts and fixed-price hedges. 

&#8226; 

Maintaining investment grade metrics. &#32;WES intends to operate at appropriate leverage and distribution coverage levels in line with other partnerships in its sector that maintain investment grade credit ratings. By maintaining investment grade credit metrics, in part through staying within leverage ratios appropriate for investment-grade partnerships, we believe that WES will be able to pursue strategic acquisitions and large growth projects at a lower cost of fixed-income capital, which would enhance their accretion and overall return. 

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 

We believe that WES is well positioned to successfully execute its strategy and achieve its primary business objective because of the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

Affiliation with Anadarko. &#32;We believe Anadarko is motivated to promote and support the successful execution of WES&#8217;s business plan and to use its relationships throughout the energy industry, including those with producers and customers in the United States, to pursue projects that help to enhance the value of WES&#8217;s business. See WES&#8217;s Relationship with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation &#32;below. 

&#8226; 

Commodity price and volumetric risk mitigation. &#32;WES&#8217;s cash flows are largely protected from fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility due to (i) the approximately 91% of its services that are provided pursuant to long-term, fee-based agreements and (ii) the commodity price swap agreements that limit its exposure to commodity price changes with respect to a majority of its percent-of-proceeds and keep-whole contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 98% &#32;of WES&#8217;s gross margin was derived from either long-term, fee-based contracts or from percent-of-proceeds or keep-whole agreements that were hedged with commodity price swap agreements. On June 25, 2015, WES extended its commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko for the DJ Basin complex from July 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, and for the Hugoton system from October 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015. On December 8, 2015, the DJ Basin complex and Hugoton system swaps were further extended from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. See Risk Factors &#32;under Part I, Item 1A and Note 5&#8212;Transactions with Affiliates &#32;in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. In addition, WES mitigates volumetric risk by entering into contracts with cost of service or demand charge structures. For the year ended December 31, 2015, and excluding throughput measured in barrels, 44% of WES&#8217;s throughput was subject to demand charges and 27% of WES&#8217;s throughput was contracted under a cost of service model. 

&#8226; 

Liquidity to pursue expansion and acquisition opportunities . &#32;We believe WES&#8217;s operating cash flows, borrowing capacity, long-term relationships and reasonable access to debt and equity capital markets provide it with the liquidity to competitively pursue acquisition and expansion opportunities and to execute its strategy across capital market cycles. As of December 31, 2015 , WES had $300 million &#32;of outstanding borrowings and $6.4 million &#32;in outstanding letters of credit issued under the $1.2 billion WES RCF. 

&#8226; 

Substantial presence in basins with historically strong producer economics. &#32;Certain of WES&#8217;s systems are in areas, such as the Delaware and DJ Basins, and the Eagleford shale, which have historically seen robust producer activity and are considered to have some of the most favorable producer returns for onshore North America. WES&#8217;s assets in these areas serve production where the hydrocarbons contain not only natural gas, but also oil, condensate and NGLs. In addition, WES&#8217;s interests in the Anadarko-Operated and Non-Operated Marcellus gathering systems serve dry gas production from the Marcellus shale, which is considered to have some of the most abundant low-cost, dry gas reserves due to the overall scale and quality of the underlying resource. See Properties &#32;below for further asset descriptions. 

&#8226; 

Well-positioned and well-maintained assets. &#32;We believe that WES&#8217;s asset portfolio, which is located in geographically diverse areas of operation, provides it with opportunities to expand and attract additional volumes to its systems from multiple productive reservoirs. Moreover, WES&#8217;s portfolio includes an integrated package of high-quality, well-maintained assets for which it has implemented modern processing, treating, measurement and operating technologies. 

&#8226; 

Consistent track record of accretive acquisitions. &#32;Since WES&#8217;s IPO in 2008, WES&#8217;s management team has successfully executed ten related-party acquisitions and six third-party acquisitions, with an aggregate value of $5.1 billion (inclusive of the forecasted cash payment of $282.8 million &#32;for the acquisition of DBJV in March 2020, see Note 2&#8212;Acquisitions and Divestitures &#32; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). WES&#8217;s management team has demonstrated its ability to identify, evaluate, negotiate, consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions and expansion projects, and it intends to use its experience and reputation to continue to grow WES&#8217;s operations through accretive acquisitions, focusing on opportunities to improve throughput volumes and cash flows. 

We believe that WES will effectively leverage its competitive strengths to successfully implement its strategy. However, WES&#8217;s business involves numerous risks and uncertainties that may prevent it from achieving its primary business objective. For a more complete description of the risks associated with our and WES&#8217;s business, read Risk Factors &#32;under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

WES&#8217;S RELATIONSHIP WITH ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION 

WES&#8217;s operations and activities are managed by its general partner, WES GP, which is our wholly owned subsidiary. Anadarko, which owns our general partner, WGP GP, an d an &#32; 87.3% &#32; limited partner interest in us, is among the largest independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the world. A nadarko&#8217;s upstream oil and gas business explores for and produces natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. 

We believe that one of WES&#8217;s principal strengths is its relationship with Anadarko, and that Anadarko, through its direct economic interest in us and significant indirect economic interest in WES, will continue to be motivated to promote and support the successful execution of WES&#8217;s business plan and to pursue projects that help to enhance the value of our and WES&#8217;s business. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Anadarko held 191,087,365 &#32;of our common units, representing an 87.3% &#32;limited partner interest in us. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , we held 49,296,205 &#32;WES common units, representing a 34.6% &#32;limited partner interest in WES, and through our ownership of WES GP, we indirectly held 2,583,068 &#32;general partner units, representing a 1.8% &#32;general partner interest in WES, and 100% of the WES IDRs. As of December 31, 2015 , other subsidiaries of Anadarko held 757,619 &#32;WES common units and 11,411,862 &#32;Class C units, representing an aggregate 8.5% &#32;limited partner interest in WES. 

In connection with our IPO in December 2012, we entered into an omnibus agreement with our general partner and Anadarko that governs (i) our obligation to reimburse Anadarko for expenses incurred or payments made on our behalf in conjunction with Anadarko&#8217;s provision of general and administrative services to us, including our public company expenses and general and administrative expenses; (ii) our obligation to pay Anadarko in quarterly installments an administrative services fee of $250,000 per year (subject to an annual increase as described in the omnibus agreement); and (iii) our obligation to reimburse Anadarko for all insurance coverage expenses it incurs or payments it makes with respect to our assets. In connection with WES&#8217;s IPO in 2008, WES entered into an omnibus agreement with Anadarko and WES GP that governs its relationship with Anadarko regarding certain reimbursement and indemnification matters. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 43% &#32;of WES&#8217;s gathering, transportation and treating throughput (excluding equity investment throughput and throughput measured in barrels) was attributable to natural gas production owned or controlled by Anadarko, and 51% &#32;of WES&#8217;s processing throughput (excluding equity investment throughput and throughput measured in barrels) was attributable to natural gas production owned or controlled by Anadarko. In addition, with respect to the Wattenberg, Haley, Helper, Clawson and Hugoton gathering systems, Anadarko has made dedications to WES that will continue to expand as long as additional wells are connected to these gathering systems. In executing its growth strategy, which includes acquiring and constructing additional midstream assets, WES will use the significant experience of Anadarko&#8217;s management team. 

WES has commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko to mitigate exposure to a majority of the commodity price volatility that would otherwise be present as a result of WES&#8217;s purchase and sale of natural gas, condensate or NGLs. These commodity price swap agreements with Anadarko at WES&#8217;s Hugoton system, MGR assets and DJ Basin complex are set to expire in December 2016. See Note 5&#8212;Transactions with Affiliates in the &#32;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Although we believe WES&#8217;s relationship with Anadarko provides it with a significant advantage in the midstream energy sector, it is also a source of potential conflicts. For example, neither we nor Anadarko is restricted from competing with WES. Given Anadarko&#8217;s significant indirect economic interest in WES and in us, we believe it will be in Anadarko&#8217;s best economic interest for it to transfer additional assets to WES over time. However, Anadarko continually evaluates acquisitions and divestitures and may elect to acquire, construct or dispose of midstream assets in the future without offering WES the opportunity to participate in such transactions. Should Anadarko choose to pursue additional midstream asset sales, it is under no contractual obligation to offer assets or business opportunities to WES, nor is WES obligated to participate in any such opportunities. We cannot state with any certainty which, if any, opportunities to acquire additional assets from Anadarko may be made available to WES or if WES will elect, or will have the ability, to pursue any such opportunities. See Risk Factors &#32;under Part I, Item 1A and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence &#32;under Part III, Item 13 of this Form 10-K for more information. 

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 

The midstream natural gas industry is the link between the exploration for and production of natural gas and the delivery of the resulting hydrocarbon components to end-use markets. Operators within this industry create value at various stages along the natural gas value chain by gathering raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead, separating the hydrocarbons into dry gas (primarily methane) and NGLs, and then routing the separated dry gas and NGL streams for delivery to end-use markets or to the next intermediate stage of the value chain. 

The following diagram illustrates the primary groups of assets found along the natural gas value chain: 

Service Types 

The services provided by WES and other midstream natural gas companies are generally classified into the categories described below. WES does not currently provide all of these services, although it may do so in the future. 

&#8226; 

Gathering. &#32;At the initial stages of the midstream value chain, a network of typically smaller diameter pipelines known as gathering systems directly connect to wellheads in the production area. These gathering systems transport raw, or untreated, natural gas to a central location for treating and processing. A large gathering system may involve thousands of miles of gathering lines connected to thousands of wells. Gathering systems are typically designed to be highly flexible to allow gathering of natural gas at different pressures and scalable to allow gathering of additional production without significant incremental capital expenditures. 

&#8226; 

Stabilization. &#32;In connection with WES&#8217;s gathering services, WES sometimes retains, stabilizes and sells drip condensate, which falls out of the natural gas stream during gathering. Stabilization is a process that separates the heavier hydrocarbons (which also serve as valuable commodities) found in natural gas, typically referred to as &#8220;liquids-rich&#8221; natural gas, from the lighter components by using a distillation process or by reducing the pressure and letting the more volatile components flash. WES provides stabilization for condensate at many of its processing plants (such as WES&#8217;s DJ Basin, Brasada and DBM complexes). 

&#8226; 

Compression. &#32;Natural gas compression is a mechanical process in which a volume of natural gas at a given pressure is compressed to a desired higher pressure, which allows the natural gas to be gathered more efficiently and delivered into a higher pressure system, processing plant or pipeline. Field compression is typically used to allow a gathering system to operate at a lower pressure or provide sufficient discharge pressure to deliver natural gas into a higher pressure system. Since wells produce at progressively lower field pressures as they deplete, field compression is needed to maintain throughput across the gathering system. 

&#8226; 

Treating and dehydration. &#32;To the extent that gathered natural gas contains water vapor or contaminants, such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, it is dehydrated to remove the saturated water and treated to separate the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from the gas stream. 

&#8226; 

Processing. &#32;Processing separates the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components, which are extracted as NGLs, from the remaining residue. The remaining residue is then designated for long-haul pipeline transportation or commercial use. 

&#8226; 

Fractionation. &#32;Fractionation is the process of applying various levels of higher pressure and lower temperature to separate a stream of NGLs into ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutane and natural gasoline for end-use sale. 

&#8226; 

Storage, transportation and marketing. &#32;Once the raw natural gas has been treated or processed and the raw NGL mix has been fractionated into individual NGL components, the natural gas and NGL components are stored, transported and marketed to end-use markets. Each pipeline system typically has storage capacity located both throughout the pipeline network and at major market centers to better accommodate seasonal demand and daily supply-demand shifts. WES does not currently offer storage services. 

Typical Contractual Arrangements 

Midstream natural gas services, other than transportation, are usually provided under contractual arrangements that vary in the amount of commodity price risk they carry. Three typical contract types, or combinations thereof, are described below: 

&#8226; 

Fee-based. &#32;Under fee-based arrangements, the service provider typically receives a fee for each unit of natural gas gathered, treated and/or processed at its facilities. As a result, the price per unit received by the service provider does not vary with commodity price changes, minimizing the service provider&#8217;s direct commodity price risk exposure. 

&#8226; 

Percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-value or percent-of-liquids. &#32;Percent-of-proceeds, percent-of-value or percent-of-liquids arrangements may be used for gathering and processing services. Under these arrangements, the service provider typically remits to the producers either a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of residue and/or NGLs or a percentage of the actual residue and/or NGLs at the tailgate. These types of arrangements expose the processor to commodity price risk, as the revenues from the contracts directly correlate with the fluctuating price of natural gas and/or NGLs. 

&#8226; 

Keep-whole. &#32;Keep-whole arrangements may be used for processing services. Under these arrangements, the service provider keeps 100% of the NGLs produced, and the processed natural gas, or value of the gas, is returned to the producer. Since some of the gas is used and removed during processing, the processor compensates the producer for the amount of gas used and removed in processing by supplying additional gas or by paying an agreed-upon value for the gas utilized. These arrangements have the highest commodity price exposure for the processor because the costs are dependent on the price of natural gas and the revenues are based on the price of NGLs. 

The above midstream natural gas services, as well as the transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, can be performed on a firm or interruptible basis, as described below: 

&#8226; 

Firm. &#32;Firm service requires the reservation of capacity by a customer between certain receipt and delivery points or within a processing facility. Firm customers generally pay a demand or capacity reservation fee based on the amount of capacity being reserved, regardless of whether the capacity is used, plus, in specific cases, a usage fee based on the volumes gathered, processed or transported. 

&#8226; 

Interruptible. &#32;Interruptible service is typically short-term in nature and is generally used by customers that either do not need firm service or have been unable to contract for firm service. These customers pay only for the volume actually gathered, processed or transported. The obligation to provide this service is limited to available capacity not otherwise used by firm customers, and, as such, customers receiving services under interruptible contracts are not assured capacity. 

See Note 1&#8212;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#32;in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding WES&#8217;s recognition of revenue under its contracts.

Mont Belvieu JV fractionation trains 

&#8226; 

Customers. &#32;The Mont Belvieu JV does not directly contract with customers, but rather is allocated volumes from Enterprise based on the available capacity of the other trains at Enterprise&#8217;s NGL fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. 

&#8226; 

Supply and delivery points. &#32;Enterprise receives volumes at its fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas via a large number of pipelines that terminate there, including the Seminole pipeline, Skelly-Belvieu Pipeline Company, LLC&#8217;s pipeline and TEP. Individual NGLs are delivered to end users either through customer-owned pipelines that are connected to nearby petrochemical plants or via export terminal. 

South Texas 

Brasada gathering system, stabilization facility and processing complex 

&#8226; 

Customers. &#32;Anadarko provides 100% of the throughput to the Brasada complex. Anadarko delivers gas and condensate to the plant on behalf of itself and its upstream joint interest owners. 

&#8226; 

Supply. &#32;Supply of gas and NGLs for the facility comes from Anadarko&#8217;s production in the Eagleford shale, in which Anadarko controls 346,000 gross acres. 

&#8226; 

Delivery points. &#32;The facility delivers residue gas into the Eagle Ford Midstream system operated by NET Midstream, LLC. It delivers stabilized condensate into Plains All American Pipeline and NGLs into the South Texas NGL Pipeline System operated by Enterprise. 

West Texas 

Haley gathering system 

&#8226; 

Customers. &#32;Anadarko&#8217;s production represented 77% of the Haley gathering system&#8217;s throughput for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The remaining throughput was attributable to one third-party producer. 

&#8226; 

Supply. &#32;As of December 31, 2015 , Anadarko holds an interest in over 600,000 gross acres in the greater Delaware Basin, a portion of which is gathered by the Haley gathering system. 

&#8226; 

Delivery points. &#32;The Haley gathering system provides both lean and rich gas gathering service. The lean service delivery point is into Enterprise GC, LLC&#8217;s pipeline for ultimate delivery into ETP&#8217;s Oasis pipeline (the &#8220;Oasis pipeline&#8221;). The rich service system delivery point is into a high pressure gathering line (the &#8220;Avalon Express pipeline&#8221;), which is part of WES&#8217;s DBJV system. The Avalon Express pipeline can deliver gas into either the Bone Spring Gas Processing plant (the &#8220;Bone Spring plant&#8221;) or the Mi Vida Gas Processing plant (the &#8220;Mi Vida plant&#8221;) for NGL extraction, both of which are partially owned by Anadarko. Downstream pipelines at the plant tailgates include the Oasis and Transwestern pipelines at the Bone Spring plant and the Oasis pipeline at the Mi Vida plant. These downstream pipelines provide transportation to both the Waha Hub and Houston Ship Channel markets. 

DBM gathering system, treating facility and processing complex. The DBM complex includes 300 MMcf/d of cryogenic processing capacity, 1,775 gpm of amine treating capacity and a 321 -mile rich gas gathering system, which has both high and low pressure segments. On December 3, 2015, there was an initial fire and secondary explosion at the processing facility within the DBM complex. There were no serious injuries and the majority of damage from the incident was to the liquid handling facilities and the amine treating units at the inlet of the complex. Train II (with capacity of 100 MMcf/d) sustained the most damage of the processing trains but is expected to be returned to service by the end of 2016. Train III (with capacity of 200 MMcf/d) experienced minimal damage and is expected to be able to accept limited deliveries of gas in April 2016, and it is expected to return to full service by the end of the second quarter of 2016, along with new liquid handling and amine treating facilities. There was no damage to Trains IV and V, which were under construction at the time of the incident, and they are expected to be completed by the previously announced in-service dates. See Assets Under Development within these Items 1 and 2. WES has a property damage insurance policy designed to cover costs to repair or rebuild damaged assets (less a $1 million deductible), and business interruption insurance designed to cover lost earnings after January 2, 2016. Insurance claims are in process under both of these policies. 

&#8226; 

Customers. &#32;Gas gathered and processed through the DBM complex is primarily from third-party producers, with the three largest producers providing 62% of the system throughput for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

Supply. &#32;Supply of gas and NGLs for the complex comes from production from the Delaware Sands, Avalon Shale, Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations in the Delaware Basin portion of the Permian Basin. Anadarko holds an interest in over 600,000 gross acres within the Delaware Basin. 

&#8226; 

Delivery points. &#32;Residue gas produced at the facility is delivered to an interconnect with the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline. NGL production is delivered into both the Sand Hills pipeline and the Lone Star NGL LLC&#8217;s pipeline.

Texas 

TEFR Interests 

&#8226; 

Front Range Pipeline. FRP provides takeaway capacity from the DJ Basin in Northeast Colorado. FRP has injection points from gas plants in Weld County, Colorado (including WES&#8217;s Lancaster plant), which is within the DJ Basin complex (see Rocky Mountains&#8212;Colorado and Utah &#32;within these Items 1 and 2). FRP connects to TEP near Skellytown, Texas. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , FRP had two committed shippers, including Anadarko, and provides capacity for other shippers at the posted FERC tariff rate. 

&#8226; 

Texas Express Gathering. TEG consists of two NGL gathering systems that provide plants in North Texas, the Texas panhandle and West Oklahoma with access to NGL takeaway capacity on TEP. TEG had one committed shipper during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

Texas Express Pipeline. TEP delivers to NGL fractionation and storage facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas. At Skellytown, Texas, TEP is supplied with NGLs from other pipelines including FRP and MAPL. TEP had multiple committed shippers, including Anadarko, during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and provides capacity for other shippers at the posted FERC tariff rates. 

Ramsey Residue Line. &#32;The Ramsey Residue Line extends from the tailgate of the DBM complex to Kinder Morgan, Inc.&#8217;s interstate pipeline system located approximately 9 miles south of the DBM complex and also has a delivery point into the Enterprise pipeline. This Ramsey Residue Line transports residue gas from the DBM complex to interstate markets and is a FERC-regulated pipeline. See DBM gathering system, treating facility and processing complex &#32;within these Items 1 and 2. 

Assets Under Development 

WES currently has the following significant projects scheduled for completion in 2016 and 2017 in West Texas: 

&#8226; 

DBM Trains IV, V and VI: &#32;WES is currently constructing Trains IV and V at its DBM complex with 200 MMcf/d of designed processing capacity per train and in-service dates expected during the first half (Train IV) and second half (Train V) of 2016. WES has also made progress payments towards the construction of another cryogenic unit at the DBM complex (Train VI), with an expected in-service date of mid-2017. 

&#8226; 

Ramsey Residue Line Expansion: WES began construction of a new residue gas pipeline that will extend from the tailgate of the DBM complex to Kinder Morgan&#8217;s El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline system located approximately 9 miles north of the complex. It is anticipated the new line will be in service during the first half of 2016. 

COMPETITION 

The midstream services business is very competitive. WES&#8217;s competitors include other midstream companies, producers, and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for natural gas and NGL volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies. However, a substantial portion of WES&#8217;s throughput volumes on a majority of its systems are owned or controlled by Anadarko. In addition, Anadarko has dedicated future production to WES from its acreage surrounding the Wattenberg, Haley, Helper, Clawson and Hugoton gathering systems. We believe that WES&#8217;s assets that are located outside of the dedicated areas are geographically well positioned to retain and attract third-party volumes due to its competitive rates. 

We believe the primary advantages of WES&#8217;s assets are their proximity to established and/or future production, and the service flexibility they provide to producers. We believe WES can provide the services that producers and other customers require to connect, gather and process their natural gas efficiently, at competitive and flexible contract terms.

No significant direct competition 

Transportation 

MIGC competes with other pipelines that service the regional market and transport gas volumes from the Powder River Basin to Glenrock, Wyoming. MIGC competitors seek to attract and connect new gas volumes throughout the Powder River Basin, including certain of the volumes currently being transported on the MIGC pipeline. Competitive factors include commercial terms, available capacity, fuel efficiencies, the interconnected pipelines and gas quality issues. MIGC&#8217;s major competitors are Thunder Creek Gas Services, LLC, TransCanada Corporation&#8217;s Bison pipeline and the Fort Union gathering system. The GNB NGL Pipeline&#8217;s major competitor is Tesoro. The White Cliffs pipeline will face direct competition from the Saddlehorn pipeline, currently under construction, in which Anadarko is a 20% interest owner. The Saddlehorn pipeline will transport crude oil from the DJ Basin and the broader Rocky Mountain area to Cushing, Oklahoma. White Cliffs pipeline shippers can also sell crude oil in local markets or ship crude via rail services rather than via pipeline to Cushing, Oklahoma. The TEFR Interests compete with the Sand Hills pipeline, West Texas LPG Pipeline LP&#8217;s, Lone Star NGL LLC&#8217;s West Texas System, Overland Pass Pipeline Company LLC&#8217;s pipeline and the Seminole pipeline. The OTTCO transportation system and the Ramsey Residue Line face no direct competition. 

REGULATION OF OPERATIONS 

Safety and Maintenance 

Many of the pipelines WES uses to gather and transport oil, natural gas and NGLs are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) of the Department of Transportation (the &#8220;DOT&#8221;) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended (the &#8220;NGPSA&#8221;), with respect to natural gas and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (the &#8220;HLPSA&#8221;), with respect to NGLs and oil. Both the NGPSA and the HLPSA were amended by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the &#8220;PSI Act&#8221;) and the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (the &#8220;PIPES Act&#8221;). The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and condensate pipeline facilities. Pursuant to these acts, PHMSA has promulgated regulations governing, among other things, pipeline wall thicknesses, design pressures, maximum operating pressures, pipeline patrols and leak surveys, minimum depth requirements, and emergency procedures, as well as other matters intended to ensure adequate protection for the public and to prevent accidents and failures. Additionally, PHMSA has promulgated regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for certain gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that, in the event of a pipeline leak or rupture, could affect &#8220;high consequence areas,&#8221; where a release could have the most significant adverse consequences, including high population areas, certain drinking water sources and unusually sensitive ecological areas. Past operation of WES&#8217;s pipelines with respect to these NGPSA and HLPSA requirements has not resulted in the incurrence of material costs; however, due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, future compliance with the NGPSA and HLPSA could result in increased costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 

These pipeline safety laws were amended when President Obama signed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the &#8220;2011 Pipeline Safety Act&#8221;), which requires increased safety measures for gas and hazardous liquids pipelines. Among other things, the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation, pipeline material strength testing, verification of the maximum allowable pressure of certain pipelines, and operator verification of records confirming the maximum allowable pressure of certain intrastate gas transmissions pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act also increases the maximum penalty for violation of pipeline safety regulations from $100,000 to $200,000 per violation per day of violation and from $1.0 million to $2.0 million for a related series of violations. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act reauthorized PHMSA through fiscal year 2015. New legislation that would reauthorize PHMSA through fiscal year 2019 and require the agency to complete outstanding mandates from the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee on December 9, 2015, and will be considered for adoption by the Senate. The safety enhancement requirements and other provisions of the 2011 Pipeline Safety Act or any new pipeline safety legislation, as well as any implementation of PHMSA regulations thereunder or any issuance or reinterpretation of PHMSA guidance with respect thereto, could require WES to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any of which could result in WES incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 

In addition, while states are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines, most are certified by PHMSA to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. WES does not anticipate any significant difficulty or material cost in complying with applicable intrastate pipeline safety laws and regulations in 2016 . WES&#8217;s pipelines have operations and maintenance plans designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety requirements. WES, or the entities in which it owns an interest, periodically inspect their pipelines pursuant to applicable state and federal maintenance requirements. Nonetheless, the adoption of new or amended regulations by PHMSA or the states in which WES operates that result in more stringent or costly pipeline integrity management or safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on WES and similarly situated midstream operators. For example, federal construction, maintenance and inspection standards that apply to pipelines in relatively populated areas may not apply to gathering lines running through rural regions. In recent years, the PHSMA has considered changes to this &#8220;rural gathering exemption,&#8221; including publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (&#8220;ANPR&#8221;) relating to gas pipelines in 2011, in which the agency sought public comment on possible changes to the definition of &#8220;high consequence areas&#8221; and &#8220;gathering lines&#8221; and the strengthening of pipeline integrity management requirements and, more recently, an ANPR relating to hazardous liquid pipelines in October 2015, in which the agency is seeking public comment on, among other things, extending reporting requirements to all gravity and gathering lines, requiring periodic incline integrity assessments of pipelines that are located outside of high consequence areas, and requiring the use of leak detection systems on pipelines in all locations, including outside of high consequence areas. The changes proposed by PHMSA in each of these ANPRs continue to remain under consideration by the agency. 

WES is also subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the community right-to-know regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;) under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in WES&#8217;s operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. WES and the entities in which it owns an interest are also subject to OSHA&#8217;s Process Safety Management (&#8220;PSM&#8221;) regulations as well as EPA&#8217;s Risk Management Program (&#8220;RMP&#8221;) regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. These regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above specified thresholds or any process which involves flammable liquid or gas in excess of 10,000 pounds. 

However, notwithstanding the applicability of these PSM and RMP requirements at regulated facilities, PHMSA and one or more state regulators, including the Texas Railroad Commission, have in recent years expanded the scope of their regulatory inspections to include certain in-plant equipment and pipelines found within NGL fractionation facilities and associated storage facilities, in order to assess compliance of such equipment and pipelines with hazardous liquid pipeline safety requirements. To the extent that these actions by PHMSA are pursued, midstream operators of NGL fractionation facilities and associated storage facilities subject to such inspection may be required to make operational changes or modifications at their facilities to meet standards beyond current PSM and RMP requirements, which changes or modifications may result in additional capital costs, possible operational delays and increased costs of operation that, in some instances, may be significant. 

Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation 

Regulation of pipeline transportation services may affect certain aspects of WES&#8217;s business and the market for its products and services. 

The operation of WES&#8217;s MIGC pipeline and WES&#8217;s natural gas residue pipeline at the tailgate of the DBM complex (&#8220;DBM pipeline&#8221;) are subject to regulation by FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (the &#8220;NGA&#8221;). Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Federal regulation extends to such matters as the following: 

&#8226; 

rates, services, and terms and conditions of service; 

&#8226; 

types of services that may be offered to customers; 

&#8226; 

certification and construction of new facilities; 

&#8226;

Natural gas companies are prohibited from charging rates that have been determined not to be just and reasonable by FERC. In addition, FERC prohibits natural gas companies from unduly preferring or unreasonably discriminating against any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service. 

The rates and terms and conditions for WES&#8217;s interstate pipeline services are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Pursuant to FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction over rates, existing rates may be challenged by complaint or by action of FERC under Section 5 of the NGA, and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest. The outcome of any successful complaint or protest against WES&#8217;s rates could have an adverse impact on revenues associated with providing transportation service. 

For example, one such matter relates to FERC&#8217;s policy regarding allowances for income taxes in determining a regulated entity&#8217;s cost of service. FERC allows regulated companies to recover an allowance for income taxes in rates only to the extent the company or its owners, such as our or WES&#8217;s unitholders, are subject to U.S. income tax. This policy affects whom we and WES allow to own WGP or WES units, and if we or WES are not successful in limiting ownership to persons or entities subject to U.S. income tax, the rates and revenues for FERC-regulated pipelines could be adversely affected. 

Interstate natural gas pipelines regulated by FERC are required to comply with numerous regulations related to standards of conduct, market transparency, and market manipulation. FERC&#8217;s standards of conduct &#32;regulate the manner in which interstate natural gas pipelines may interact with their marketing affiliates (unless FERC has granted a waiver of such standards). FERC&#8217;s market oversight and transparency regulations require annual reports of purchases or sales of natural gas meeting certain thresholds and criteria and certain public postings of information on scheduled volumes. FERC&#8217;s market manipulation regulations promulgated pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the &#8220;EPAct 2005&#8221;) &#32;make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The EPAct 2005 also amends the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (the &#8220;NGPA&#8221;) to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes, up to $1.0 million per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. 

Interstate Liquids Pipeline Regulation 

Regulation of interstate liquids pipeline services may affect certain aspects of WES&#8217;s business and the market for its products and services. 

WES&#8217;s NGL pipelines with FERC tariffs on file provide service as common carriers under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and related rules and orders. FERC regulation requires that interstate liquid pipeline rates, including rates for transportation of NGLs, be filed with FERC and that these rates be &#8220;just and reasonable&#8221; and not unduly discriminatory. 

Rates of interstate NGL pipelines are currently regulated by FERC primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by FERC. For the five-year period beginning in 2010, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 2.65%. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. Under FERC&#8217;s regulations, an NGL pipeline can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. 

The Interstate Commerce Act permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation. The just and reasonable rate used to calculate refunds cannot be lower than the last tariff rate approved as just and reasonable. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for charges in excess of a just and reasonable rate for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. 

Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation 

Regulation of gathering pipeline services may affect certain aspects of WES&#8217;s business and the market for its products and services. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC. We believe that WES&#8217;s natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction, although FERC has not made any determinations with respect to the jurisdictional status of any of WES&#8217;s pipelines other than MIGC and the DBM pipeline. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, so the classification and regulation of WES&#8217;s gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. FERC makes jurisdictional determinations on a case-by-case basis. In recent years, FERC has regulated the gathering activities of interstate pipeline transmission companies more lightly, which has resulted in a number of such companies transferring gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. As a result of these activities, natural gas gathering may begin to receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels. WES&#8217;s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. WES&#8217;s natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on WES&#8217;s operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes. 

WES&#8217;s natural gas gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which it operates. These statutes generally require WES&#8217;s gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on WES&#8217;s ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to gather natural gas. The states in which WES operates have adopted a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against WES in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there has been no adverse effect to WES&#8217;s systems due to these regulations. 

FERC&#8217;s anti-manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted &#8220;in connection with&#8221; gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but only to the extent such transactions do not have a &#8220;nexus&#8221; to jurisdictional transactions. In addition, FERC&#8217;s market oversight and transparency regulations may also apply to otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent annual purchases and sales of natural gas reach a certain threshold. As noted above, FERC&#8217;s civil penalty authority under EPAct 2005 would apply to violations of these rules. 

Intrastate Pipeline Regulation 

Regulation of intrastate pipeline services may affect certain aspects of WES&#8217;s business and the market for its products and services. Intrastate natural gas and liquids transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate shippers within the state on a comparable basis, WES believes that the regulation of intrastate transportation in any states in which WES operates will not disproportionately affect WES&#8217;s operations. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of the products that WES produces, as well as the revenues WES receives for sales of such products. 

In the event any of WES&#8217;s intrastate pipelines offer natural gas transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA, such pipelines will be required to meet certain quarterly reporting requirements providing detailed transaction information which could be made public. Such pipelines will also be subject to periodic rate review by FERC. In addition, FERC&#8217;s anti-manipulation, market oversight, and market transparency regulations may extend to intrastate natural gas pipelines although they may otherwise be non-jurisdictional, and FERC&#8217;s civil penalty authority under EPAct 2005 would apply to violations of these rules. 

Financial Reform Legislation 

For a description of financial reform legislation that may affect WES&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations, read Risk Factors &#32;under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

WES&#8217;s business operations are subject to numerous federal, regional, state, tribal, and local environmental laws and regulations. The more significant of these existing environmental laws and regulations include the following U.S. laws and regulations, as amended from time to time: 

&#8226; 

the U.S. Clean Air Act, which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, imposes various pre-construction, monitoring, and reporting requirements, and the EPA uses as its basis for adopting greenhouse gas regulatory initiatives. 

&#8226; 

the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Federal Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemakings as protected waters of the United States. 

&#8226; 

the U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which subjects owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States. 

&#8226; 

the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, which imposes liability on generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur. 

&#8226; 

the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes. 

&#8226; 

the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act, which ensures the quality of the nation&#8217;s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources. 

&#8226; 

the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and response departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories. 

&#8226; 

the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas. 

&#8226; 

the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to impact the environment and that may require the preparation of Environmental Assessments and more detailed Environmental Impact Statements that may be made available for public review and comment. 

These laws and regulations, as well as state counterparts, generally restrict the level of pollutants emitted to ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of WES&#8217;s activities in a particular area. See the following risk factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on ozone standards, climate change, including methane or other greenhouse gas emissions, hydraulic fracturing and other regulations related to environmental protection: &#8220;WES is subject to stringent and comprehensive environmental laws and regulations that may expose WES to significant costs and liabilities,&#8221; &#8220;The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the gathering, processing, compressing, treating and transporting services WES provides,&#8221; and &#32;&#8220;Changes in laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs, operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, which could decrease the need for WES&#8217;s gathering and processing services.&#8221; &#32;The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known nor determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards and water quality standards, continue to evolve. 

Many states where WES operates also have, or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. While the legal requirements imposed under state law may be similar in form to U.S. laws and regulations, in some cases the actual implementation of these requirements may impose additional, or more stringent, conditions or controls that can significantly alter or delay the permitting, development or expansion of a project or substantially increase the cost of doing business. In addition, environmental laws and regulations, including new or amended legal requirements that may arise to address potential environmental concerns including air and water impacts, are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on WES&#8217;s operations in the United States. 

WES has incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. Although WES is not fully insured against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks, and WES&#8217;s insurance does not cover any penalties or fines that may be issued by a governmental authority, it maintains insurance coverage that it believes is sufficient based on WES&#8217;s assessment of insurable risks and consistent with insurance coverage held by other similarly situated industry participants. Nevertheless, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter and more comprehensive environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, as well as claims for damages to property or persons resulting from WES&#8217;s operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, to WES. Historically, WES&#8217;s environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in the future, or that new or more stringently applied existing laws and regulations will not materially increase the cost of doing business. 

TITLE TO PROPERTIES AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY 

WES&#8217;s real property is classified into two categories: (1) parcels that it owns in fee title and (2) parcels in which its interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for WES&#8217;s operations. Portions of the land on which WES&#8217;s plants and other major facilities are located are owned by it in fee title, and WES believes that it has satisfactory title to these lands. The remainder of the land on which WES&#8217;s plant sites and major facilities are located are held by it pursuant to surface leases between WES, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. WES or its affiliates have leased or owned these lands for many years without any material challenge known to it relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and WES believes that it has satisfactory leasehold estates or fee ownership of such lands. WES has no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by WES or to its title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease, and WES believes that it has satisfactory title to all of its material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses. 

Some of the leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses transferred to WES by Anadarko required the consent of the grantor of such rights, which in certain instances is a governmental entity. WES GP has obtained sufficient third-party consents, permits and authorizations for the transfer of the assets necessary to enable WES to operate its business in all material respects. With respect to any remaining consents, permits or authorizations that have not been obtained, WES has determined these will not have material adverse effect on the operation of its business should WES fail to obtain such consents, permits or authorization in a reasonable time frame. 

Anadarko may hold record title to portions of certain assets as WES makes the appropriate filings in the jurisdictions in which such assets are located and obtain any consents and approvals as needed. Such consents and approvals would include those required by federal and state agencies or other political subdivisions. In some cases, Anadarko temporarily holds record title to property as nominee for WES&#8217;s benefit and in other cases may, on the basis of expense and difficulty associated with the conveyance of title, cause its affiliates to retain title, as nominee for WES&#8217;s benefit, until a future date. WES anticipates that there will be no material change in the tax treatment of its common units resulting from Anadarko holding the title to any part of such assets subject to future conveyance or as WES&#8217;s nominee. 

EMPLOYEES 

We and our general partner have no employees. The officers of our general partner manage our operations and activities under the direction and supervision of our general partner&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the officers of WES GP manage WES&#8217;s operations and activities under the direction and supervision of WES GP&#8217;s Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2015 , Anadarko employed 364 people who provided direct support to WES&#8217;s field operations. All of these employees are deemed jointly employed by Anadarko and WES GP under the services and secondment agreement between WES GP and Anadarko. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and Anadarko considers its employee relations to be good. We and WES have separately contracted with Anadarko under omnibus agreements for general and administrative support.
