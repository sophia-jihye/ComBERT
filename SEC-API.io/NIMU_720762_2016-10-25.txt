General 

&#160; 

Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;NIMS,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on July 16, 1980. The Company&#8217;s offices are located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida, 33137 and its telephone number is (305) 575-4200. The Company&#8217;s primary business is the research, development, manufacture and marketing of a line of motorized, non-invasive, whole body, periodic acceleration platforms, which are intended as aids to increase local circulation and temporary relief of minor aches and pains, produce local muscle relaxation and reduce morning stiffness. Our current products are derivatives of our original acceleration platform, the AT-101 (described below), and are intended for use in homes, wellness and fitness centers, healthcare providers offices and clinics, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, sports facilities and hospitals. 

&#160; 

Company Overview 

&#160; 

Prior to 2002, our primary business was the development of computer-assisted, non-invasive diagnostic monitoring devices and related software designed to detect abnormal respiratory, cardiac and other medical conditions from sensors placed externally on the body&#8217;s surface. 

&#160; 

In 2002, we began focusing on the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of non-invasive, motorized, whole body periodic acceleration (&#8220;WBPA&#8221;) platforms. These therapeutic acceleration platforms are intended as aids to temporarily increase local circulation for temporary relief of minor aches and pains, produce local muscle relaxation and reduce morning stiffness. Our first such platform, the AT-101, was initially registered with the United States Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) as a Class 1 (exempt) powered exercise device and was sold to physicians and their patients. In January 2005, the FDA disagreed with our device classification, and requested that we cease commercial sales and marketing of the AT-101 until we received clearance from the FDA to market the device following submission of a 510(k) application incorporating appropriate clinical trial data. Accordingly, we ceased our commercial sales and marketing of therapeutic platforms in 2005. 

&#160; 

In January 2005, we began development of a less costly and more efficient second generation version of the AT-101, the Exer-Rest &#174; (now designated the Exer-Rest AT). In January 2008, we received ISO 13485 certification for Canada, the United Kingdom and Europe from SGS United Kingdom Ltd., the world&#8217;s leading verification and certification body. We did not renew our ISO certification in 2016. In addition, the Exer-Rest AT acceleration therapeutic platform (Class IIa) was awarded CE0120 certification, which requires several safety-related conformity tests, including clinical assessment for safety and effectiveness. The CE0120 certification is often referred to as a &#8220;passport&#8221; that allows manufacturers from anywhere in the world to sell their goods throughout the European market, as well as in many other countries. Prior to obtaining FDA registration for the sale of our therapeutic acceleration platforms in the United States, we marketed and sold the Exer-Rest AT platforms in the United Kingdom, Canada, India and Latin America. 

&#160; 

We entered into a product development and supply agreement with Sing Lin Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Sing Lin&#8221;) of Taichung, Taiwan on September 4, 2007. Under this agreement, Sing Lin began manufacturing the third generation versions of our patented Exer-Rest motorized platforms (designated the Exer-Rest AT3800 and the Exer-Rest AT4700). We filed a 510(k) premarket notification submission with the FDA in October 2008 for approval to market the Exer-Rest line of platforms in the United States. The submission included 23 investigational and clinical studies on the vasodilatation properties of WBPA, as well as a controlled, four week clinical trial in a group of patients with chronic aches and pains carried out at the Center of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. The submission supported Exer-Rest safety and efficacy for the intended uses as an aid to temporarily increase local circulation, to provide temporary relief of minor aches and pains and to provide local muscle relaxation. The FDA informed us in January 2009 that the full Exer-Rest line of products would be registered as Class I (Exempt) Medical Devices as described in the Company&#8217;s 510(k) premarket notification submission, at which time we commenced marketing the Exer-Rest in the United States. In June 2009, the FDA notified us that the additional intended use of the Exer-Rest as an aid to reduce morning stiffness would be added to the Exer-Rest&#8217;s FDA registration. We have historically marketed and sold our Exer-Rest devices in the United States, Canada, the UK, India, Mexico, the Middle East, the Far East and Latin America. Prior to the termination of our development and supply agreement with them, Sing Lin marketed and sold the Exer-Rest exclusively in certain Asian markets.

Market Opportunities 

&#160; 

More than thirty peer reviewed scientific publications attest to the benefits of WBPA in animal and human research investigations. According to those studies, the application of this WBPA technology provides objective benefits in patients with angina pectoris and increases the blood supply to the heart muscle in both healthy individuals and patients with heart disease. These findings are not claimed as an intended use of the device for marketing purposes, but demonstrate a potential mechanism for its benefits. We believe the market for our products is driven by, among other factors: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; the aging population; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the increasing number of elderly persons reporting chronic ailments; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; an increased awareness of the benefits of exercise, particularly as a form of prevention; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; an increasing portion of the population that is incapable of performing traditional exercise; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the expanding body of research connecting the body&#8217;s reduction of inflammation and improved transmission of neural impulses. &#160; 

Our products are designed for use by people who are unable or unwilling to exercise or for whom exercise is contraindicated. We market the Exer-Rest line of platforms for the intended uses of temporarily increasing local circulation, temporarily relieving minor aches and pains, providing local muscle relaxation and as an aid to reduce morning stiffness. These symptoms are frequently reported by individuals with chronic cardiovascular, neurological or musculoskeletal conditions, although we do not claim that the Exer-Rest is intended to treat these conditions. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Whole Body Periodic Acceleration (&#8220;WBPA&#8221;) Therapeutic Devices 

&#160; 

The original AT-101 was a comfortable gurney-styled device that provided movement of a platform repetitively in a head-to-foot motion at a rapid pace. Sales of the AT-101 commenced in October 2002 in Japan and in February 2003 in the United States. QTM Incorporated (&#8220;QTM&#8221;), an FDA registered manufacturer located in Oldsmar, Florida, manufactured the device, which was built in accordance with ISO and Good Manufacturing Practices. As discussed above, we ceased manufacturing and selling the AT-101 in the United States in January 2005 as we began development of the Exer-Rest AT. We continued selling our existing inventory of AT-101 devices overseas until the Exer-Rest AT became available in October 2007, at which time we discontinued marketing of the AT-101. 

&#160; 

The Exer-Rest AT is based upon the design and concept of the AT-101, but has the dimensions and appearance of a commercial extra long twin bed. The Exer-Rest AT, which was also manufactured by QTM until we stopped production in July 2009, weighs about half as much as the AT-101, has a much more efficient and less costly drive mechanism, has a much lower selling price than did the AT-101 and is designed such that the user can utilize and operate it without assistance. The wired hand held controller provides digital values for speed, travel and time, rather than analog values for speed and arbitrary force values as in the AT-101. Sales of the Exer-Rest AT began outside the United States in October 2007 and in the United States in February 2009. We discontinued manufacturing of the Exer-Rest AT in July 2009, and we expect to utilize our remaining inventory of these units primarily for research purposes. 

&#160; 

The Exer-Rest AT3800 and Exer-Rest AT4700, which were manufactured for us by Sing Lin prior to the termination of our agreement with them, are next generation versions of the Exer-Rest AT and further advance the acceleration therapeutic platform technology. The AT3800 (38&#8221; wide) and AT4700 (47&#8221; wide) models combine improved drive technology for quieter operation, a more comfortable &#8220;memory-foam&#8221; mattress, more convenient operation with a multi-function wireless remote and a more streamlined look to improve the WBPA experience. Sales of the Exer-Rest AT3800 and Exer-Rest AT4700 platforms began outside the United States in October 2008, and U.S. sales commenced in February 2009. 

&#160; 

LifeShirt &#174; 

&#160; 

The LifeShirt is a patented Wearable Physiological Computer that incorporates transducers, electrodes and sensors into a sleeveless garment. These sensors transmit vital and physiological signs to a miniaturized, battery-powered, electronic module which saves the raw waveforms and digital data to the compact flash memory of a Personal Digital Assistant (&#8220;PDA&#8221;) attached to the LifeShirt. Users of the LifeShirt can enter symptoms (with intensity), mood and medication information directly into the PDA for integration with the physiologic information collected by the LifeShirt garment. The flash memory can then be removed from the LifeShirt and the data uploaded and converted into minute-by-minute median trends of more than 30 physical and emotional signs of health and disease. Vital and physiological signs can therefore be obtained non-invasively, continuously, cheaply and reliably with the comfortably worn LifeShirt garment system while resting, exercising, working or sleeping. The LifeShirt was sold exclusively by VivoMetrics, but has not been marketed since VivoMetrics ceased operations in July 2009. Pursuant to VivoMetrics&#8217; approved bankruptcy plan of reorganization, our license with VivoMetrics was assigned to another company; however, there can be no assurance as to the future amount of LifeShirt sales, if any, that may result from this license. We periodically contact the current owner of the license for progress updates.

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We currently hold five United States patents with respect to both overall design and specific features of our present and proposed products, with corresponding foreign patents issued or pending in multiple jurisdictions. No assurance can be given as to the scope of protection afforded by any patent issued, whether patents will be issued with respect to any pending or future patent application, that patents issued will not be designed around, infringed or successfully challenged by others, that we will have sufficient resources to enforce any proprietary protection afforded by our patents or that our technology will not infringe on patents held by others. We believe that in the event our patent protection is materially impaired, a material adverse effect on our present and proposed business could result. The following table lists our patents, along with their expiration dates (each of which is 20 years from the filing date):

With respect to our present and potential product line, we have six trademarks and trade names which are registered in the United States and in several foreign countries, including our principal trademark, &#8220;Exer-Rest&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to develop a portfolio of non-invasive products through a combination of internal development and collaborations with external partners. We have historically sponsored or monitored research investigating the effectiveness of WBPA in chronic heart failure, mild traumatic brain injury, acute myocardial infarction, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, peripheral vascular disease and lymphedema. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with several entities that market, sell or distribute therapeutic devices that are registered with the FDA as powered exercise devices, or therapeutic vibrators. These include Power Plate of North America, Vibraflex and CERAGEM International, Inc., all of which are larger than we are, have longer operating histories and have financial and personnel resources far greater than ours. We believe that we essentially compete with such competitors based upon the uniqueness of our products and our product differentiation on the basis of intended uses and operation.

Government Regulation of our Medical Device Development and Distribution Activities 

&#160; 

Healthcare is heavily regulated by the federal government and by state and local governments. The federal laws and regulations affecting healthcare change constantly thereby increasing the uncertainty and risk associated with any healthcare-related venture. 

&#160; 

The federal government regulates healthcare through various agencies, including but not limited to the following: (i) the FDA which administers the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FD&#38;C Act&#8221;), as well as other relevant laws; (ii) the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) which administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iii) the Office of Inspector General (&#8220;OIG&#8221;), which enforces various laws aimed at curtailing fraudulent or abusive practices including, by way of example, the Anti-Kickback statute, the Physician Self Referral Law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, the Anti-Inducement Law, the Civil Money Penalty Law, and the laws that authorize the OIG to exclude health care providers and others from participating in federal healthcare programs; and (iv) the Office of Civil Rights which administers the privacy aspects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;). All of the aforementioned are agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;). Healthcare is also provided or regulated, as the case may be, by the Department of Defense through its TriCare program, the Department of Veterans Affairs, especially through the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, Public Health Service within HHS under the Public Health Service Act, the Department of Justice through the Federal False Claims Act and various criminal statutes, and state governments under the Medicaid and other state sponsored or funded programs and their internal laws regulating all healthcare activities. 

&#160; 

FDA Regulation of the Design, Manufacture and Distribution of Medical Devices 

&#160; 

The testing, manufacture, distribution, advertising and marketing of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries. Any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory clearances or approvals, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country. Under United States law, a &#8220;medical device&#8221; (&#8220;device&#8221;) is an article, which, among other things, is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, in man or other animals. See FD&#38;C Act &#167; 201(h). Substantially all of our products are classified as medical devices and subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and its foreign counterparts. 

&#160; 

As a company that manufactures medical devices, we are required to register with the FDA. As a result, we and any entity that manufactures products on our behalf will be subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation requirements and other regulations. In the European Community, we will be required to maintain certain International Organization for Standardization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) certifications in order to sell products and we or our manufacturers undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. The Company did not maintain its ISO certificate in 2016 and no longer has ISO certification. These regulations require us or our manufacturers to manufacture products and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA and other agency requirements for labeling and promotion. The Medical Device Reporting regulations require that we provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence to reasonably suggest that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. In addition, the FDA prohibits us from promoting a medical device for unapproved indications. 

&#160; 

The FDA in the course of enforcing the FD&#38;C Act may subject a company to various sanctions for violating FDA regulations or provisions of the Act, including requiring recalls, issuing Warning Letters, seeking to impose civil money penalties, seizing devices that the agency believes are non-compliant, seeking to enjoin distribution of a specific type of device or other product, seeking to revoke a clearance or approval, seeking disgorgement of profits and seeking to criminally prosecute a company and its officers and other responsible parties. 

&#160; 

In March 2011, we received a warning letter from the FDA regarding our promotion of the Exer-Rest. We addressed the FDA&#8217;s concerns by revising our marketing material and website content. On October 28, 2011, we received a FDA Form 483 with three observations related to our marketing material and certain protocols. As a result of those observations, the FDA recommended we voluntarily recall our marketing materials from the US market. We have complied with the FDA recommendation and in August 2012, the FDA notified NIMS that they have reviewed our actions and concluded that the voluntary recall has been completed. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Third-Party Payments, Especially payments by Medicare and Medicaid 

&#160; 

A. Medicare and Medicaid Coverage 

&#160; 

Because of the projected patient population that could potentially benefit from our devices is elderly, Medicare could be a potential source of reimbursement. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and those suffering from Lou Gehrig&#8217;s Disease. In contrast, Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by federal and state governments and administered by each state pursuant to which benefits are available to certain indigent patients. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid. 

&#160; 

Medicare reimburses for medical devices in a variety of ways depending on where and how the device is used. However, Medicare only provides reimbursement if CMS, either directly or through one of its contracts, determines that the device should be covered and that the use of the device is consistent with the coverage criteria. A coverage determination can be made at the local level (&#8220;Local Coverage Determination&#8221;) by the Medicare administrative contractor (formerly called carriers and fiscal intermediaries), a private contractor that processes and pays claims on behalf of CMS for the geographic area where the services were rendered, or at the national level by CMS through a National Coverage Determination. There are statutory provisions intended to facilitate coverage determinations for new technologies under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (&#8220;MMA&#8221;) &#167;&#167; 731 and 942. Coverage presupposes that the device has been cleared or approved by the FDA and, further, that the coverage will be no broader than the FDA approved intended uses of the device (i.e., the device&#8217;s label) as cleared or approved by the FDA, but coverage can be narrower. In that regard, a narrow Medicare coverage determination may undermine the commercial viability of a device. It is unclear whether the therapies and treatments that would use our primary products would be covered under Local or National Coverage Determinations. 

&#160; 

Seeking to modify a coverage determination, whether local or national, is a time-consuming, expensive and highly uncertain proposition, especially for a new technology, and inconsistent local determinations are possible. On average, according to an industry report, Medicare coverage determinations for medical devices lag 15 months to five years or more behind FDA approval for respective devices. Moreover, Medicaid programs and private insurers are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations. Our inability to obtain a favorable coverage determination may adversely affect our ability to market our products and thus, the commercial viability of our products. 

&#160; 

B. Reimbursement Levels 

&#160; 

We do not have Medicare or any other third-party reimbursement programs specific for our product. Even if Medicare and other third-party payor programs cover the procedures that use our devices, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient for commercial success. The Medicare reimbursement levels for covered procedures are determined annually through three sets of rulemakings, one for outpatient departments of hospitals under the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (&#8220;OPPS&#8221;), another for the inpatient departments of hospitals under the Inpatient Perspective Payment System (&#8220;IPPS&#8221;), and a third for procedures in physicians&#8217; offices under the Resource-Based Relative Value Scales (&#8220;RBRVS&#8221;) (the Medicare fee schedule). If the use of a device is covered by Medicare, a physician&#8217;s ability to bill a Medicare patient more than the Medicare allowable amount is significantly constrained by the rules limiting balance billing. For covered services in a physician&#8217;s office, Medicare normally pays 80% of the Medicare allowable amount and the beneficiary pays the remaining 20%, assuming that the beneficiary has met his or her annual Medicare deductible and is not also a Medicaid beneficiary. For services performed in an outpatient department of a hospital, the patient&#8217;s co-payment under Medicare may exceed 20%, depending on the service and depending on whether CMS has set the co-payment at greater than 20%. If a device is used as part of an in-patient procedure, the hospital where the procedure is performed is reimbursed under the IPPS. In general, IPPS provides a single payment to the hospital based on the diagnosis at discharge and devices are not separately reimbursed under IPPS. 

&#160; 

Usually, Medicaid pays less than Medicare, assuming that the state covers the service. In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures and the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk. Efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare providers by private and public payors are expected to continue. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Significant limits on the scope of services covered or on reimbursement rates and fees on those services that are covered could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize our devices and therefore, on our liquidity and financial condition. 

&#160; 

State and Federal Security and Privacy Regulations 

&#160; 

The privacy and security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the &#8220;HITECH Act&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information, or PHI, by health plans and health care providers, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#9679; the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, to obtain payments for services and health care operations activities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; a patient&#8217;s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the content of notices of privacy practices for PHI; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI electronically. &#160; 

The final &#8220;omnibus&#8221; rule implementing the HITECH Act took effect on March 26, 2013. The rule is broad in scope, but certain provisions are particularly significant in light of our business operations. For example, the final &#8220;omnibus&#8221; rule implementing the HITECH Act: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#9679; Makes clear that situations involving impermissible access, acquisition, use or disclosure of protected health information are now presumed to be a breach unless the covered entity or business associate is able to demonstrate that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Defines the term &#8220;business associate&#8221; to include subcontractors and agents that receive, create, maintain or transmit protected health information on behalf of the business associate; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Establishes new parameters for covered entities and business associates on uses and disclosures of PHI for fundraising and marketing; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Establishes clear restrictions on the sale of PHI without patient authorization. &#160; 

The privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. 

&#160; 

Anti-Kickback Laws, Physician Self-Referral Laws, False Claims Act, Civil Monetary Penalties 

&#160; 

We are also subject to various federal, state, and international laws pertaining to health care &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any remuneration with the intent to refer, or to arrange for the referral or order of, services or items payable under a federal health care program, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug or the use of a service or device. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, to issue a series of regulations, known as &#8220;safe harbors.&#8221; These safe harbors set forth requirements that, if met in their entirety, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal, or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by the imposition of criminal fines, civil money penalties, treble damages, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Many states have also enacted similar anti-kickback laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws and regulations are expansive. If the government were to allege against or convict us of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and our stock price. Even an unsuccessful challenge could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We will consult counsel concerning the potential application of these and other laws to our business and our sales, marketing and other activities and will make good faith efforts to comply with them. However, given the broad reach of federal and state anti-kickback laws and the increasing attention given by law enforcement authorities, we are unable to predict whether any of our activities will be challenged or deemed to violate these laws. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to the physician self-referral laws, commonly referred to as the Stark law, which is a strict liability statute that generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to providers of &#8220;designated health services,&#8221; with whom the physician or the physician&#8217;s immediate family member has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless an applicable exception applies. Moreover, many states have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws, some of which extend beyond the scope of the Stark law to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the prohibited referral of patients for designated healthcare services and physician self-referrals, regardless of the source of the payment for the patient&#8217;s care. If it is determined that certain of our practices or operations violate the Stark law or similar statutes, we could become subject to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare programs and loss of government reimbursement. The imposition of any such penalties could harm our business.

Another development affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal civil False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act&#8217;s &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; or &#8220;qui tam&#8221; provisions. The False Claims Act, as amended by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal health care program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly adversely affect our financial performance. 

&#160; 

Federal law prohibits any entity from offering or transferring to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary&#8217;s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof) and transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market value. Entities found in violation may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Although we believe that our sales and marketing practices are in material compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, relevant regulatory authorities may disagree and violation of these laws, or, our exclusion from such programs as Medicaid and other governmental programs as a result of a violation of such laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We have no commercial manufacturing facilities, and we do not intend to build commercial manufacturing facilities of our own in the foreseeable future. All of our manufacturing had been performed by Sing Lin, Genemax Medical Products Industry Corp (&#8220;Genemax&#8221;), QTM and other FDA registered contract manufacturers. Genemax manufactured our product under the management of Sing Lin. All of our contract manufacturers and their manufacturing facilities must comply with FDA regulations, current quality system regulations (referred to as QSRs), which include current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and to the extent laboratory analysis is involved, current good laboratory practices, or cGLPs. We notified Sing Lin in June 2010 that we were terminating our manufacturing agreement with them, which termination was effective September 2010. As a result, we currently have no supplier contracted to manufacture our products, and Sing Lin and its suppliers are currently in possession of the tooling required to manufacture our products. If we are unable to enter into a new agreement for the manufacture and supply of our devices, whether with Sing Lin or another supplier we may not be able to procure additional inventory on a timely basis, in the quantities we require or at all. We estimate that our existing inventory of Exer-Rest products will, at a minimum, be sufficient to meet demand through the end of the 2017 fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Sales &#38; Marketing 

&#160; 

Our limited sales efforts are currently focused on hospitals, cardiac rehabilitation clinics, physical therapy centers, senior living communities and other healthcare providers, as well as their patients, professional athletes and other individuals through our management. In addition to our limited sales efforts, we continue to explore potential distributor and independent sale representative networks in the US, Canada and abroad. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into additional distribution and representation agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all, or that our sales and distribution network will generate significant sales. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

The Company currently does not have full time employees. Our administrative, accounting and legal functions are contracted on a part-time basis.
