At January 30, 2016 , we operated a total of 1,449 &#32;stores. Our goal is to exceed our core customer&#8217;s expectations by providing her with great savings on value-priced merchandise, which includes tasteful and &#8220;trend-right&#8221; import merchandise, consistent and replenishable &#8220;never out&#8221; offerings, and brand-name closeouts.

We manage our business on the basis of one segment: discount retailing. We evaluate and report overall sales and merchandise performance based on the following key merchandising categories: Food, Consumables, Soft Home, Hard Home, Furniture, Seasonal, and Electronics &#38; Accessories. The Food category includes our beverage &#38; grocery, candy &#38; snacks, and specialty foods departments. The Consumables category includes our health and beauty, plastics, paper, chemical, and pet departments. The Soft Home category includes our home d&#233;cor, frames, fashion bedding, utility bedding, bath, window, decorative textile, and area rugs departments. The Hard Home category includes our small appliances, table top, food preparation, stationery, greeting cards, and home maintenance departments. The Furniture category includes our upholstery, mattress, ready-to-assemble, and case goods departments. The Seasonal category includes our lawn &#38; garden, summer, Christmas, toys, and other holiday departments.

Please refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Form 10-K for our financial information. Specifically, see note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our net sales results by merchandise category for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . 

In May 2001, Big Lots, Inc. was incorporated in Ohio and was the surviving entity in a merger with Consolidated Stores Corporation, a Delaware corporation. By virtue of the merger, Big Lots, Inc. succeeded to all the businesses, properties, assets, and liabilities of Consolidated Stores Corporation. In July 2011, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Liquidation World Inc. (subsequently named Big Lots Canada, Inc.). In 2014, we completed the wind down and dissolution of Big Lots Canada, Inc. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 300 Phillipi Road, Columbus, Ohio 43228, and our telephone number is (614) 278&#8209;6800.

Merchandise 

Our business has historically focused on selling value-based merchandise sourced through closeout channels, which can result in inconsistent offerings to our customers. In 2014, we implemented a merchandising strategy to improve the consistency of the value-based merchandise available in our stores by reducing our reliance on sourcing closeout offerings in certain merchandise categories. In order to improve the consistency of our merchandise, we introduced new disciplines for purchasing merchandise through the use of a ratings process that measures quality, brand, fashion, and value. This discipline requires us to focus our decision-making activities on our customers&#8217; expectations and enables us to compare the potential performance of traditionally-sourced merchandise, either domestic or import, to closeout merchandise, which is generally sourced from production overruns, packaging changes, discontinued products, order cancellations, liquidations, returns, and other disruptions in the supply chain of manufacturers. We believe this greater level of focus on our customers&#8217; expectations enhances our ability to provide a desirable assortment of offerings in our merchandise categories and improves our inventory turnover. For net sales and comparable store sales by merchandise category, see the discussion below under the captions &#8220; 2015 &#32;Compared To 2014 &#8221; and &#8220; 2014 &#32;Compared To 2013 &#8221; in &#8220;Item 7.

Number of states 

Of our 1,449 &#32;stores, 33% &#32;operate in four states: California, Texas, Ohio, and Florida, and net sales from stores in these states represented 35% of our 2015 &#32;net sales. We have a concentration in these states based on their size, population, and customer base. 

Associates 

At January 30, 2016 , we had approximately 35,900 &#32;active associates comprised of 11,400 &#32;full-time and 24,500 &#32;part&#8209;time associates. Approximately 68% of the associates employed throughout the year are employed on a part-time basis. Temporary associates hired for the holiday selling season increased the number of associates to a peak of approximately 39,900 &#32;in 2015 . We consider our relationship with our associates to be good, and we are not a party to any labor agreements. 

Competition 

We operate in the highly competitive retail industry. We face strong sales competition from other general merchandise, discount, food, furniture, arts and crafts, and dollar store retailers, which operate in traditional brick and mortar stores and/or online. Additionally, we compete with a number of companies for retail site locations, to attract and retain quality employees, and to acquire our broad merchandising assortment from vendors. 

Purchasing 

Our goal is to provide great savings to our customers through value-based merchandise offerings. In 2014, we implemented a merchandising strategy to improve the consistency of the value-based merchandise available in our stores by reducing our reliance on sourcing closeout offerings in certain merchandise categories. In particular, we expanded our planned purchases in our Food, Soft Home, and Furniture merchandise categories, which provide an assortment of merchandise that our customers expect us to consistently offer in our stores at a significant value savings. 

&#32;4 

Although reduced in certain categories, the sourcing and purchasing of quality closeout merchandise directly from manufacturers and other vendors, typically at prices below those paid by traditional discount retailers, continues to represent an important competitive advantage for our business. We believe that we have built strong relationships with many brand-name vendors, and these relationships, along with our purchasing power, enable us to source merchandise that provides exceptional value to our customers. One of the key factors in building our vendor relationships is our ability to purchase significant quantities of closeout merchandise and then control its distribution throughout our broad store footprint, in accordance with our vendor&#8217;s guidelines. We believe our sourcing model, along with our strong credit profile, provide a high level of service and convenience to our vendors. We intend to continue to deepen our relationships with our top 200 vendors. Our sourcing channels also include bankruptcies, liquidations, and insurance claims. We expect that the unpredictability of the retail and manufacturing environments coupled with what we believe is our significant purchasing power position will continue to support our ability to source quality closeout merchandise at competitive prices. 

During 2015 , we purchased approximately 24% of our merchandise directly from overseas vendors, including approximately 20% from vendors located in China. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. As a result, a significant portion of our merchandise supply is subject to certain risks described in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Warehouse and Distribution 

The majority of our merchandise offerings are processed for retail sale and distributed to our stores from our five regional distribution centers located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Alabama, Oklahoma, and California. We selected the locations of our distribution centers to minimize transportation costs and the distance from distribution centers to our stores. While certain of our merchandise vendors deliver directly to our stores, the large majority of our inventory is staged and delivered from our distribution centers to facilitate prompt and efficient distribution and transportation of merchandise to our stores and help maximize our sales and inventory turnover rate. During 2015, we announced our intention to open a new distribution center in California and relocating our existing California operations to this facility. This transition is anticipated to occur in 2018. 

In addition to the regional distribution centers that handle merchandise, we operate a warehouse within our Ohio distribution center that distributes fixtures and supplies to our stores and our five regional distribution centers. 

For additional information regarding our warehouses and distribution facilities and related initiatives, see the discussion under the caption &#8220;Warehouse and Distribution&#8221; in &#8220;Item 2. Properties&#8221; of this Form 10-K. 

Advertising and Promotion 

Our brand image is an important part of our marketing program. Our principal trademarks, including the Big Lots &#174; &#32;family of trademarks, have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We use a variety of marketing vehicles to promote our brand operations, including television, internet, social media, in-store point-of-purchase, and print media. 

In all markets served by our stores, we design and distribute printed advertising circulars, through a combination of newspaper insertions and mailings. In 2015 , we distributed multi-page circulars representing 31 weeks of advertising coverage, which resulted in a one week increase from 2014 . We create regional versions of these circulars to tailor our advertising message to market differences caused by product availability, climate, and customer preferences. Our customer database, which we refer to as the Buzz Club &#174; , is an important marketing tool that allows us to communicate in a cost effective manner with our customers, including e-mail delivery of our circulars. In addition to the Buzz Club &#174; , we operate the Buzz Club Rewards &#174; &#32;program (&#8220;Rewards&#8221;), which allows us to send specialized promotions to targeted customer groups with the intention of reinforcing and expanding their desire to shop at our stores. 

A newer element of our marketing approach focuses on brand management through social and digital media outlets. We have devoted focused resources to communicate our message directly to our core customers through Facebook &#174; , Twitter &#174; , Pinterest &#174; , and YouTube &#174; . A more traditional element of our marketing program is our television campaign, which combines elements of strategic branding and promotion. These same elements are also used in most of our other marketing media. Our highly-targeted media placement strategy uses national cable as the foundation of our television advertising. In addition, we use in-store promotional materials, including in-store signage, to emphasize special bargains and significant values offered to our customers. Total advertising expense as a percentage of total net sales was 1.8%, 1.9%, and 1.9% in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

&#32;5 

Seasonality 

We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability, with a larger percentage of our net sales and operating profit realized in our fourth fiscal quarter. In addition, our quarterly net sales and operating profits can be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the timing of advertising, and the timing of certain holidays. We historically receive a higher proportion of merchandise, carry higher inventory levels, and incur higher outbound shipping and payroll expenses as a percentage of sales in our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during our fourth fiscal quarter. Performance during our fourth fiscal quarter typically reflects a leveraging effect which has a favorable impact on our operating results because net sales are higher and certain of our costs, such as rent and depreciation, are fixed and do not vary as sales levels escalate. For a quantitative view of this leveraging effect, see &#8220;Seasonality&#8221; in the accompanying MD&#38;A in this Form 10-K. 

The seasonality of our net sales and related merchandise inventory requirements influences the availability of and demand for cash or access to credit. We historically have drawn upon our credit facility to assist in funding our working capital requirements, which typically peak near the end of our third fiscal quarter. We historically have higher net sales, operating profits, and cash flow provided by operations in the fourth fiscal quarter which allows us to substantially repay our seasonal borrowings. In 2015, our total indebtedness (outstanding borrowings and letters of credit) peaked in November 2015 at approximately $383 million under our $700 million unsecured credit facility entered into in July 2011, and most recently amended in May 2015 (&#8220;2011 Credit Agreement&#8221;). The 2011 Credit Agreement expires in May 2020. At January 30, 2016 , our total indebtedness under the 2011 Credit Agreement was $65.5 million , which included $62.3 million &#32;in borrowings and $3.2 million &#32;in outstanding letters of credit. We expect that borrowings will vary throughout 2016 depending on various factors, including our seasonal need to acquire merchandise inventory prior to the peak selling season, the timing and amount of sales to our customers, and the timing of share repurchase or dividend payment activity. For a discussion of our sources and uses of funds, see &#8220;Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#8221; and &#8220;Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; in the accompanying MD&#38;A, in this Form 10-K.
