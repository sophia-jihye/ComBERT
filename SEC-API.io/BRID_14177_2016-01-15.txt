Background of Business 

&#160; 

Bridgford Foods Corporation (collectively with its subsidiaries, &#8220;Bridgford&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;), a California corporation, was organized in 1952. We originally began operations in 1932 as a retail meat market in San Diego, California and evolved into a meat wholesaler for hotels and restaurants, a distributor of frozen food products, a processor and packer of meat, and a manufacturer and distributor of frozen food products for sale on a retail and wholesale basis. For more than the past five years we and our subsidiaries have been primarily engaged in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of an extensive line of frozen and snack food products throughout the United States. Bridgford Foods Corporation has not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings since inception nor have we been party to any merger, acquisition, etc. or acquired or disposed of any material amounts of assets during the past five years. Substantially all of our assets have been acquired in the ordinary course of business. 

&#160; 

Description of Business 

&#160; 

Bridgford Foods Corporation currently operates in two business segments - the processing and distribution of frozen products and the processing and distribution of snack food products. For information regarding the separate financial performance of the business segments refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

The following table shows sales, as a percentage of consolidated sales, for each business segment during the last two fiscal years:

We manufacture and distribute an extensive line of food products, including biscuits, bread dough items, roll dough items, dry sausage products and beef jerky. Through the end of fiscal 2014, our direct store delivery network consisted of two separate divisions, refrigerated and non-refrigerated snack food products. Refrigerated snack food products were distributed through eight different regions located in the southwest, primarily operating in California, Arizona and Nevada. By the end of fiscal 2014, we ceased refrigerated snack food product distribution because of continued net losses. Our frozen food products division serves both food service and retail customers. Approximately 160 unique frozen food products are sold through wholesalers, cooperatives, and distributors to approximately 21,000 retail outlets and 23,000 restaurants and institutions.

Although we have recently introduced several new products, most of these products have not contributed significantly to our revenue growth for the 2015 fiscal year. Our sales are not subject to material seasonal variations. Historically we have been able to respond quickly to the receipt of orders and, accordingly, do not maintain a significant sales backlog. Bridgford Foods Corporation and its industry generally have no unusual demands or restrictions on working capital items. During the last fiscal year we did not enter into any new markets or any significant contractual or other material relationships. 

&#160; 

Availability of SEC Filings and Code of Conduct on Internet Website 

&#160; 

We maintain an Internet website at http://www.bridgford.com. Available on this website, free of charge, are annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and reports filed under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our Code of Conduct is also available on the website. 

&#160; 

Product Distribution Methods 

&#160; 

Our products are delivered to customers using several distinct distribution channels. The distribution channel utilized is dependent upon the needs of our customers, the most efficient proximity to the delivery point, trade customs, operating segment as well as product type, life and stability. Among our customers are many of the country&#8217;s largest broadline and specialty food service distributors. These and other large end purchasers occasionally go through extensive qualification procedures and our manufacturing capabilities are subjected to thorough review by the end purchasers prior to our approval as a vendor. Large end purchasers typically select suppliers that can consistently meet increased volume requirements on a national basis during peak promotional periods. We believe that our manufacturing flexibility, national presence, and long-standing customer relationships should allow us to compete effectively with other manufacturers seeking to provide similar products to our current large food service end purchasers, although no assurances can be given. 

&#160; 

The factors that contribute to higher or lower margins generated from each method of distribution depend upon the accepted selling price, level of involvement by our employees in setting up and maintaining displays, distance traveled and fuel consumed by our company-owned fleet as well as freight and shipping costs depending on the distance the product travels to the delivery point. Management is continually evaluating the profitability of product delivery methods, analyzing alternate methods and weighing economic inputs to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of delivery to fulfill the needs of our customers. 

&#160; 

Major Product Classes 

&#160; 

Frozen Food Products 

&#160; 

Our frozen food products division serves both food service and retail customers. Approximately 160 unique frozen food products are sold through wholesalers, cooperatives, and distributors to approximately 21,000 retail outlets and 23,000 restaurants and institutions. 

&#160; 

Frozen Food Products &#8211; Food Service Customers 

&#160; 

The food service industry is composed of establishments that serve food outside the home and includes restaurants, the food operations of health care providers, schools, hotels, resorts, corporations, and other traditional and non-traditional food service outlets. Growth in this industry has been driven by the increase in away-from-home meal preparation, which has accompanied the expanding number of both dual income and single-parent households. Another trend within the food service industry is the growth in the number of non-traditional food service outlets such as convenience stores, retail stores, and supermarkets. These non-traditional locations often lack extensive cooking, storage, or preparation facilities resulting in a need for pre-cooked and prepared foods similar to those we provide. The expansion in the food service industry has also been accompanied by the continued consolidation and growth of broadline and specialty food service distributors, many of which are long-standing customers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Frozen Food Products &#8211; Retail Customers 

&#160; 

The majority of our existing and targeted retail customers are involved in the resale of branded and private label packaged foods. The same trends which have contributed to the increase in away-from-home meal preparation have also fueled the growth in easy to prepare, microwaveable frozen and refrigerated convenience foods. Among the fastest growing segments is the frozen and refrigerated hand-held foods market. This growth has been driven by improved product quality and variety and the increasing need for inexpensive and healthy food items that require minimal preparation. Despite rapid growth, many categories of frozen and refrigerated hand-held foods have achieved minimal household penetration. We believe we have been successful in establishing and maintaining supply relationships with certain selected leading retailers in this market. 

&#160; 

Frozen Food Products &#8211; Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Our frozen food business covers the United States. Products produced by the Frozen Food Products segment are generally supplied to food service and retail distributors who take title to the product upon shipment receipt through company leased long-haul vehicles. In addition to regional sales managers, we maintain a network of independent food service and retail brokers covering most of the United States. Brokers are compensated on a commission basis. We believe that our broker relationships, in close cooperation with our regional sales managers, are a valuable asset providing significant new product and customer opportunities. Regional sales managers perform several significant functions for us, including identifying and developing new business opportunities and providing customer service and support to our distributors and end purchasers through the effective use of our broker network. 

&#160; 

Our annual advertising expenditures are directed towards retail and institutional customers. These customers participate in various special promotional and marketing programs and direct advertising allowances we sponsor. We also invest in general consumer advertising in various newspapers and periodicals including free standing inserts and coupons to advertise in major markets. We direct advertising toward food service customers with campaigns in major industry publications and through our participation in trade shows throughout the United States. Our advertising strategy includes our presence on social media and online distribution of promotional material. 

&#160; 

Snack Food Products 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2015, our snack food products division sold approximately 90 different items through customer owned distribution centers and a direct store delivery network serving approximately 15,000 supermarkets, mass merchandise and convenience retail stores located in 49 states. By the end of fiscal 2014, we ceased our route distribution operations in Canada as a cost cutting measure to concentrate on our core route business in the United States in addition to ceasing distribution of refrigerated deli food division because of continued losses. 

&#160; 

Products produced or distributed by the Snack Food Products segment are supplied to customers through either direct delivery to customer warehouses or direct-store-delivery to retail locations. We utilize customer managed warehouse distribution centers to lower distribution cost. Product delivered to the customer&#8217;s warehouse is then distributed to the store where it is resold to the end consumer. Our direct-store-delivery system focus emphasizes high quality service of our premium branded product to our customers. We also provide the service of setting up and maintaining the display and restocking our products. 

&#160; 

Snack Food Products &#8212; Customers 

&#160; 

Our customers are comprised of large retail chains and smaller &#8220;independent&#8221; operators. This part of our business is highly competitive. Proper placement of our product lines is critical to selling success since most items could be considered &#8220;impulse&#8221; items which are often consumed shortly after purchase. Our ability to sell successfully to this distribution channel depends on aggressive marketing and maintaining relationships with key buyers. 

&#160; 

Snack Food Products &#8212; Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Snack food products are distributed across the United States. Regional sales managers perform several significant functions including identifying and developing new business opportunities and providing customer service and support to our customers. We also utilize the services of brokers, where appropriate, to support efficient product distribution and customer satisfaction. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Product Planning and Research and Development 

&#160; 

We continually monitor the consumer acceptance of each product within our extensive product line. Individual products are regularly added to and deleted from our product line. Historically, the addition or deletion of any individual product has not had a material effect on our operations in the current fiscal year. We believe that a key factor in the success of our products is our system of carefully targeted research and testing of our products to ensure high quality and that each product matches an identified market opportunity. The emphasis in new product introductions in the past several years has been in single service items. We are constantly searching to develop new products to complement our existing product lines and improve processing techniques and formulas. We utilize an in-house test kitchen and consultants to research and experiment with unique food preparation methods, improve quality control and analyze new ingredient mixtures. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our products are sold under highly competitive conditions. All food products can be considered competitive with other food products, but we consider our principal competitors to include national, regional and local producers and distributors of refrigerated, frozen and non-refrigerated snack food products. Several of our competitors include large companies with substantially greater financial and marketing resources than ours. Existing competitors may broaden their product lines and potential competitors may enter or increase their focus on our market, resulting in greater competition for us. We believe that our products compete favorably with those of our competitors. Such competitors&#8217; products compete against ours for retail shelf space, institutional distribution and customer preference. 

&#160; 

Effect of Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to extensive inspection and regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture (the &#8220;USDA&#8221;), the Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;), and by other federal, state, and local authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, transportation, distribution, and labeling of products that we manufacture, produce and process. Our processing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by the USDA and/or other federal, state, and local authorities. The USDA has issued strict regulations concerning the control of listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products and contamination by food borne pathogens such as E. coli and salmonella, and implemented a system of regulation known as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (&#8220;HACCP&#8221;) program. The HACCP program requires all meat and poultry processing plants to develop and implement sanitary operating procedures and other program requirements. We believe that we are currently in compliance with governmental laws and regulations and that we maintain the necessary permits and licenses relating to our meat operations. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") oversees safety compliance and establishes certain employer responsibilities to help "assure safe and healthful working conditions" and keep the workplace free of recognized hazards or practices likely to cause death or serious injury. Failure to comply with regulations of OSHA could adversely affect our results of operations. 

&#160; 

To date, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, have not had a material effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Importance of Key Customers 

&#160; 

Sales to Wal-Mart&#174; comprised 31.4% of revenues in fiscal 2015 and 42.6% of total accounts receivable was due from Wal-Mart&#174; at October 30, 2015. Sales to Wal-Mart&#174; comprised 28.8% of revenues in fiscal 2014 and 31.8% of total accounts receivable was due from Wal-Mart&#174; at October 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We purchase large quantities of pork, beef, and flour. These ingredients are generally available from a number of different suppliers although the availability of these ingredients is subject to seasonal variation. We build ingredient inventories to take advantage of downward trends in seasonal prices or anticipated supply limitations. 

&#160; 

Most flour purchases are made at market price without contracts. We also purchases bulk flour under short-term fixed price contracts at current market prices. The contracts are usually effective for a month or less and are not material to our operations. These contracts are settled within a month&#8217;s time and no significant contracts remain open at the close of the reporting period. We monitor and manage our ingredient costs to help negate volatile daily swings in market prices when possible. We do not participate in the commodity futures market or hedging to limit commodity exposure. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We had 507 employees at October 30, 2015, approximately 38% of whose employment relationship is governed by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements currently expire between February 2016 and March 2017. We believe that our relationship with all of our employees is favorable and contracts will be settled favorably. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we closed the refrigerated snack food products division and withdrew from the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan, terminating approximately 44 employees. 

&#160;
